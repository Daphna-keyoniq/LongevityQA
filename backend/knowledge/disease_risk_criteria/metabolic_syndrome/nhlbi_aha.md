According to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), the cluster of metabolic factors involved includes:

1. Abdominal obesity. This means having a waist circumference of more than 35 inches for women and more than 40 inches for men. An increased waist circumference is the form of obesity most strongly tied to metabolic syndrome.
2. High blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg (millimeters of mercury) or higher. Normal blood pressure is defined as less than 120 mm Hg for systolic pressure (the top number), and less than 80 mm Hg for diastolic pressure (the bottom number). High blood pressure is strongly tied to obesity. It is often found in people with insulin resistance.
3. Impaired fasting blood glucose. This means a level equal to or greater than 100 mg/dL
4. High triglyceride levels of more than 150 mg/dL. Triglycerides are a type of fat in the blood.
5. Low HDL (good) cholesterol. Less than 40 mg/dL for men and less than 50 mg/dL for women is considered low.

The NHLBI and AHA recommend a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome when a person has 3 or more of these factors.

Categorical Cut Points


Fibrates and nicotinic acid are the most commonly used drugs for elevated triglycerides and reduced HDL-C. Patients taking 1of these drugs presumed to have high triglycerides and low HDL.

1. Elevated waist circumference*	≥102 cm (≥40 inches) in men
 	≥88 cm (≥35 inches) in women
 	 
2. Elevated triglycerides	≥150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L)
 	or
 	Drug treatment for elevated triglycerides
 	 
3. Reduced HDL-Colesterol	<40 mg/dL (1.03 mmol/L) in men
 	<50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L) in women
 	or
 	Drug treatment for reduced HDL-Colesterol
 	 
4. Elevated blood pressure (BP)	≥130 mm Hg systolic BP
 	or
 	≥85 mm Hg diastolic BP
 	or
 	Drug treatment for hypertension
 	 
5. Elevated fasting glucose	≥100 mg/dL
 	or
 	Drug treatment for elevated glucose


*To measure waist circumference, locate top of right iliac crest. Place a measuring tape in a horizontal plane around the abdomen at level of iliac crest. Before reading tape measure, ensure that tape is snug but does not compress the skin and is parallel to floor. Measurement is made at end of normal expiration.

*Some US adults of non-Asian origin (eg, white, black, Hispanic) with marginally increased waist circumference (eg, 94–101 cm [37–39 inches] in men and 80–87 cm [31–34 inches] in women) may have strong genetic contribution to insulin resistance and should benefit from changes in lifestyle habits, similar to men with categorical increases in waist circumference. Lower waist circumference cut point (eg, ≥90 cm [35 inches] in men and ≥80 cm [31 inches] in women) appears to be appropriate for Asian Americans.
