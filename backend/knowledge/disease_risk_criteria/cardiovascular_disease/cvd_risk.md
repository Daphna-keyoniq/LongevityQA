# Assessing CVD Risk

## High CVD Risk for Moderate-to-Severe Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)

Assess CVD risk as high for people with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease meeting any of these criteria:

- People with sustained eGFR <45mL/min/1.73m², or
- Men with persistent uACR >25mg/mmol, or
- Women with persistent uACR >35mg/mmol.

**Consensus**  
Assess CVD risk as high for people with a confirmed diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolaemia.  

## Moderate-to-Severe Chronic Kidney Disease

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent risk factor for CVD.

- Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is inversely correlated with CVD risk at a population level. As eGFR decreases (starting from <75mL/min/1.73m²), the risk of CVD-related mortality increases. At eGFR of 15mL/min/1.73m², the risk is approximately three times higher.
- The increase in risk is even greater for young adults, where CVD-related mortality may increase to an approximate ten-fold risk in those with eGFR of 15mL/min/1.73m².
- Increased albumin excretion is also associated with CVD mortality risk, independent of eGFR.

People with moderate-to-severe CKD (sustained eGFR <45mL/min/1.73m² and/or persistent uACR >25mg/mmol [men] or uACR >35mg/mmol [women]) are at clinically determined high risk and should be automatically managed as high CVD risk.

## Familial Hypercholesterolaemia

Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is the most common inherited cause of premature CHD, with a prevalence of 1 in 250.

People with diagnosed FH are at clinically determined high risk and should be automatically managed as high CVD risk.

Individuals with FH should be treated according to Australian guidelines for managing FH. FH-specific calculators may be useful.

## Using the Australian Cardiovascular Disease Risk Calculator

The Australian cardiovascular disease risk calculator (Aus CVD Risk Calculator) is validated for people aged 30 to 79 years without known CVD who do not already meet high-risk criteria. The accuracy of risk estimates in people aged 80 and over is uncertain, and the calculator is likely to underestimate risk in these individuals.

The Aus CVD Risk Calculator produces estimated 5-year CVD risk scores, expressed as a percentage representing the person’s probability of dying or being hospitalized due to myocardial infarction, angina, other coronary heart disease, stroke, transient ischaemic attack, peripheral vascular disease, congestive heart failure, or other ischaemic CVD-related conditions within the next 5 years.

## General Considerations

The Aus CVD Risk Calculator includes traditional variables (age, sex, smoking status, diabetes, BP, and lipids) as well as other factors like eGFR and uACR to improve prediction accuracy. These measures help avoid under- or overestimating risk.

### Diabetes and CVD Risk

- Type 2 diabetes is associated with a two-fold increased risk of CVD.
- For people with diabetes, it’s essential to stratify risk further due to significant heterogeneity in outcomes.

### Type 1 Diabetes

The Aus CVD Risk Calculator is not validated for type 1 diabetes, and using it in this population may give inaccurate estimates.

### Socioeconomic Factors

Socioeconomic status is associated with increased CVD risk. In Australia, CVD risk is higher for those with greater socioeconomic disadvantage. The calculator uses SEIFA quintiles, which are based on postcode data reflecting factors like education, housing, and employment.

### First Nations People

SEIFA may not fully capture the broader determinants of health inequality faced by First Nations people. It may be necessary to consider additional socioeconomic factors when assessing risk for this group.

# CVD Risk Categories

The Aus CVD Risk Calculator produces a CVD risk estimate expressed as a percentage probability of dying or being hospitalised due to myocardial infarction, angina, other coronary heart disease, stroke, transient ischaemic attack, peripheral vascular disease, congestive heart failure, or other ischaemic CVD-related conditions within the next 5 years. 

To streamline this terminology for consumer-facing communications and aid implementation, the CVD risk estimate can be simplified to: the probability of experiencing a heart attack, stroke, or vascular disease in the next 5 years.

Based on this score, people can be placed into one of three risk categories, which will determine the management approach: low (<5%), intermediate (5% to <10%), or high (≥10%) risk (see Table 5).

Although this updated guideline recommends initiating treatment in people at CVD risk ≥10%, this risk level for initiating treatment is likely to be comparable to the previously recommended 15% CVD risk level calculated using the Framingham equation.

## Table 5: Estimated 5-year CVD Risk Categories Based on the Aus CVD Risk Calculator

| Risk Category | Estimated 5-year CVD Risk |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| High          | ≥10%                      |
| Intermediate  | 5% to <10%                |
| Low           | <5%                       |

## CVD Risk Assessment Frequency and Intervals Using the Aus CVD Risk Calculator

### Recommendations

| Strength   | Certainty of Evidence | Recommendations |
|------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Conditional | Moderate               | Intervals between reassessments of CVD risk using the Australian cardiovascular disease risk calculator should be determined using the most recent estimated risk level. |
| Conditional | Very Low               | For people receiving pharmacological treatment to manage CVD risk, including those previously assessed as being at high risk (≥10%) of a cardiovascular event within 5 years, formal reassessment of CVD risk is not generally recommended, and management should be guided by the clinical context. |
| Conditional | Very Low               | In people with an intermediate risk (5% to <10%) of a cardiovascular event within 5 years, who are not receiving pharmacological treatment to reduce CVD risk, reassess after 2 years. Reassess earlier if any of the following apply: <br> - The most recent risk assessment was close to the threshold for high risk (≥10%) <br> - Risk factors worsen <br> - New CVD risk factors are identified. |
| Conditional | Low                    | In people with a low risk (<5%) of a cardiovascular event within 5 years, who are not receiving pharmacological treatment to reduce CVD risk, reassess after 5 years. Reassess earlier if any of the following apply: <br> - The most recent risk assessment was close to the threshold for intermediate risk (5% to <10%) <br> - Risk factors worsen <br> - New CVD risk factors are identified. |
| Consensus   |                       | For First Nations people, reassess every year as part of an annual health check (or opportunistically), or at least every 2 years. |

### General Considerations

The optimal interval between baseline CVD risk assessment and subsequent CVD risk reassessments balances the objective of detecting increased risk as early as possible to inform treatment decisions with that of avoiding unnecessary assessments.

Available evidence indicates that, in general, CVD risk increases slowly and gradually. Therefore, assessments to detect meaningful increases in risk are best conducted several years apart; more frequent assessments are unlikely to be necessary and may also detect fluctuations in CVD risk factors rather than substantive changes in overall risk.

Those with estimated risk closer to the 5% or 10% thresholds may benefit from earlier reassessment.

Within any risk category, people closer to the upper risk threshold will tend to cross into the next risk category soonest. Accordingly, earlier assessment of people closer to the upper risk treatment threshold will help to detect the need for intervention to reduce CVD risk.
