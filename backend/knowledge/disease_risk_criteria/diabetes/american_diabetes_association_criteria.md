### Criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes in nonpregnant individuals: 

American Diabetes Association criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes
1. glycated hemoglobin A1C ≥6.5% (≥48 mmol/mol). The test should be performed in a laboratory using a method that is National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program certified and standardized to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial assay.* 

OR

2. fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥126 mg/dL (≥7.0 mmol/L). Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 h.* 

OR

3. 2-h plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL (≥11.1 mmol/L) during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The test should be performed as described by the WHO, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water.* 

OR

4. In a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, a random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L).

* In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, diagnosis requires 2 abnormal test results from the same sample or in 2 separate test samples.


### Risk factors for diabetes: 
1. Adults with overweight or obesity (BMI ≥25 kg/m2 or ≥23 kg/m2 in Asian American individuals) who have one or more of the following risk factors: 
 • First-degree relative with diabetes 
 • High-risk race and ethnicity (e.g., African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, Pacific Islander) 
 • History of cardiovascular disease 
 • Hypertension (≥130/80 mmHg or on therapy for hypertension) 
 • HDL cholesterol level <35 mg/dL (<0.9 mmol/L) and/or a triglyceride level >250 mg/dL (>2.8 mmol/L) 
 • Individuals with polycystic ovary syndrome 
 • Physical inactivity 
 • Other clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance (e.g., severe obesity, acanthosis nigricans) 
2. People with prediabetes (A1C ≥5.7% [≥39 mmol/mol], impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance)
3. People who were diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus.
4. Age over 35 years. 
6. People with HIV, exposure to high-risk medicines, history of pancreatitis 


### Screening for and diagnosis of GDM

One-step strategy 
Perform a 75-g OGTT, with plasma glucose measurement when an individual is fasting and at 1 and 2 h, at 24–28 weeks of gestation in individuals not previously diagnosed with diabetes. 
The OGTT should be performed in the morning after an overnight fast of at least 8 h. 
The diagnosis of GDM is made when any of the following plasma glucose values are met or exceeded: 
 • Fasting: 92 mg/dL (5.1 mmol/L) 
 • 1 h: 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L) 
 • 2 h: 153 mg/dL (8.5 mmol/L) 
Two-step strategy 
Step 1: Perform a 50-g GLT (nonfasting), with plasma glucose measurement at 1 h, at 24–28 weeks of gestation in individuals not previously diagnosed with diabetes. 
If the plasma glucose level measured 1 h after the load is ≥130, 135, or 140 mg/dL (7.2, 7.5, or 7.8 mmol/L, respectively),* proceed to a 100-g OGTT. 
Step 2: The 100-g OGTT should be performed when the individual is fasting. 
The diagnosis of GDM is made when at least two† of the following four plasma glucose levels (measured fasting and at 1, 2, and 3 h during OGTT) are met or exceeded (Carpenter-Coustan criteria [226]): 
 • Fasting: 95 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/L) 
 • 1 h: 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L) 
 • 2 h: 155 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L) 
 • 3 h: 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) 
GDM, gestational diabetes mellitus; GLT, glucose load test; OGTT, oral glucose tolerance test.*American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends any of the commonly used thresholds of 130, 135, or 140 mg/dL for the 1-h 50-g GLT (222).†ACOG notes that one elevated value can be used for diagnosis (222).
