Diagnosis
The glycated hemoglobin test, also called hemoglobing a1c / hba1c, most often diagnoses type 2 diabetes. It reflects the average blood sugar level for the past two to three months. Results mean the following:

Below 5.7% is healthy.
5.7% to 6.4% is prediabetes.
6.5% or higher on two separate tests means diabetes.
If there are no A1C tests or if you have certain conditions that get in the way of A1C test results, your healthcare professional may use the following tests to diagnose diabetes:

Random blood sugar test. Blood sugar values show in milligrams of sugar per deciliter (mg/dL) or millimoles of sugar per liter (mmol/L) of blood. It doesn't matter when you last ate. A level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher suggests diabetes. This is most likely if you also have symptoms of diabetes, such as urinating often and being very thirsty.

Fasting blood sugar test. You give a blood sample for testing after not eating overnight. Results are as follows:

Less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) is healthy.
100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) is prediabetes.
126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher on two tests is diabetes.
Oral glucose tolerance test. This mainly tests the blood sugar of people who are pregnant and those who have cystic fibrosis. You don't eat for a certain amount of time. Then you drink a sugary liquid at your healthcare team's office. You give blood samples over two hours to test blood sugar levels. Results are as follows:

Less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) after two hours is healthy.
140 to 199 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L and 11.0 mmol/L) is prediabetes.
200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher after two hours suggests diabetes.
