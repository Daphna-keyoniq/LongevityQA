**Abstract** Dietary proteins are beneficial in alleviating lifestyle and/or age-related health problems such as loss of muscle mass and strength, obesity/sarcopenic obesity, dyslipidaemia, bone mineral loss, and type-2 diabetes. They promote muscle protein synthesis, satiation, optimization of growth factors, inhibition of inflammatory substances, and regulation of major pathways of metabolism. High-quality proteins in adequate amounts, combined with a healthy lifestyle, contribute to healthy aging by maintaining muscle mass and enhancing recovery from diseases. Proteins from legumes/pulses and milk (e.g., whey proteins) may benefit elderly people by reducing the risk of coronary artery diseases, obesity, bone density loss, type-2 diabetes, and associated morbidities/mortalities. This chapter discusses the health benefits of increased intake of dietary proteins in elderly people.
