**Abstract** Exploring molecular mechanisms of aging and determinants of lifespan will help reduce age-related morbidity, thus facilitating healthy brain aging. Recently, it has been demonstrated that nutritional polyphenols, the main constituents of the Mediterranean diet, maintain redox balance and neuroprotection through the activation of hormetic vitagene pathway. Mitochondria play pivotal roles in the mechanisms of cellular aging and lifespan extension. Nrf2-dependent pathways of cellular stress response with their target antioxidant *vitagenes* are emerging as powerful systems capable to preserve redox homeostasis under environmental and metabolic stresses. *Vitagenes* encode redox longevity genes induced by oxidative damage including heat shock family (Hsp) Hsp32, Hsp70, glutathione, thioredoxin and sirtuin protein systems. During aging process, a gradual decline of the heat shock response occurs and this may prevent repair of protein damage. Therefore, there is a growing interest by scientific community in developing of novel preventive and pharmacological agents capable of inducing stress responses at the minimum dose within the broad frame of hormesis as therapeutic strategy in patients suffering from chronic degenerative diseases. The special attention of this paper is focused on potential neuroprotective mechanisms of nutrition, in particular dietary polyphenols involved in the activation of *vitagenes* resulting in improved intracellular antioxidant defense systems against ROS damage leading to degeneration and death with considerable impact on brain health and longevity processes.
