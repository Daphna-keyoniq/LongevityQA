**25.3 Calorie Restriction Mimetics as Aging Modulators**

Currently, in the broadest terms, CRMs are viewed as any intervention that demonstrates the systemic effects of CR and increases life expectancy and prevents aging. These include anorectic or nutrient absorption inhibiting agents such as caloric restriction mimetics, calorie-reducing drugs such as sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), and even bariatric surgery (Ingram et al. 2006).

An important debatable issue in this concept is the precise definition of the concept of CR mimetics as pharmacological agents (Shintani et al. 2018, Madeo et al. 2019). Over the past two decades, there has been no consensus on the biochemical and functional determination of CR mimetics (Ingram and Roth 2015). Pioneers of the mimetic concept, Ingram et al. suggested descriptors specific to CRM: (1) mimics the metabolic, hormonal, and physiological effects of the CR; (2) activates stress response pathways observed in CR and enhances the stress protection; (3) produces CR-like effects on longevity, reduces age-related disease, and maintains more youthful function; and (4) does not significantly reduce food intake, at least over the short-term (Ingram and Roth, 2015; Ingram et al. 2006, 2004). Based on these descriptors, the concept of mimetics is a broad view of the CR mimetics.

In a narrower sense, the basic properties of CR mimetics are thought to be associated with the regulation of autophagy and glucose metabolism as key mechanisms of calorie restriction within the cell (Shintani et al. 2018, Madeo et al. 2019). According to Madeo et al. CRms are compounds that activate autophagy by promoting the deacetylation of the cellular proteins, by (1) depleting acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA), (2) inhibiting acetyltransferases, and/or (3) stimulating deacetylases (Madeo et al. 2019).

The question of the ability of CRMs to increase life expectancy is unclear. It is assumed that the overall cumulative effect of the CRM exposure is an increase in life expectancy and a decrease in age-related disorders (Ingram et al. 2006). However, the effectiveness of CRMs in this aspect is unclear and, for example, so far, only rapamycin has shown a steady effect on the increase in life expectancy as in rodents regardless of their sex (Miller et al. 2011; Harrison et al. 2009). But at the same time, in another study, rapamycin has a limited effect on aging in mammals and increases lifespan, possibly activating mechanisms of suppression of carcinogenesis (Neff et al. 2013). The lack of CRMs effectiveness to increase lifespan may be due to the fact, that the positive effects of the CR are mediated through the regulation of many intracellular signaling pathways, whereas CRMs are apparently involved in the activation of only some of the pathways and there is no single CR mimetic capable of mimicking CR alone. Therefore, some studies suggest the use of a combination of several CR mimetics (Ingram and Roth 2015). Thus, most likely CRM is a group of molecularly unrelated compounds capable of partially causing effects similar to CR on the cells, tissues, and organs.

However, despite the absence of the mimetics that completely mimick the effects of the calorie restriction, the currently known CRMs are able to positively influence the aging processes of the cardiovascular system, and also reduce acute ischemia in preclinical models (Sciarretta et al. 2020). Slowing down the aging of the neuromuscular junctions and muscle fibers has also been observed with the exposure to CRMs (Stockinger et al. 2018). What’s more, CRMs have beneficial effects on the brain aging and prevent Alzheimer’s disease (Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2016; Chiba et al. 2010). In addition, numerous studies indicate a protective role for CRMs in diabetes and obesity (Chiba et al. 2010).

**25.4 Calorie Restriction Mimetics and Adult Stem Cell Aging**

The previous section of the chapter described the relationship between CR and adult stem cell function, and reported studies showing that CR has a generally positive effect on the adult stem cells and inhibits aging. Accordingly, it is logical to assume that when exposed to CRMs, one can expect their influence on the functioning of the stem cells through the activation of the molecular pathways involved in the response to CR. Therefore, in this section of the chapter, we summarize the impact of CRMs on the adult stem cells in aging.

The intestinal tract is the first organ in contact with food, and at the same time is very sensitive to calorie restriction (Peña-Villalobos et al. 2019), therefore, first of all, it is necessary to pay attention to the reactions of the intestinal stem cells to the action of CRMs. It has been shown that the antidiabetic drug metformin, which is classified as CRMs (Martel et al. 2021), improve aging phenotypes (hyperproliferation, centrosome amplification, and accumulation of DNA damage) in the Drosophila intestinal stem cells through the down-regulation of the AKT / TOR signaling pathway (Na et al. 2015, 2018). It was recently found that alpha-lipoic acid (ALA; 1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid), also referred to as CRM, also had a positive effect on the aging phenotypes of the Drosophila intestinal stem cells, resulting in the suppression of the age-related hyperproliferation of the intestinal stem cells (Du et al. 2020). Interestingly, the effect of ALA on stem cells was achieved not due to the antioxidant capacity, but due to the activation of the expression of specific genes associated with the autophagy and endocytosis in old cells (Du et al. 2020).

Nicotinamide riboside (NR), a precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ), is a potent anti-inflammatory agent and an aging modulator (Mehmel et al. 2020) with CRMs properties (Madeo et al. 2019). A study by Igarashi et al. (2019) found that oral administration of NR at a concentration of 500 mg/kg/day in drinking water for 6 weeks resulted in ISC recovery in aged mice *in vivo*, while ex vivo studies showed improved colony formation in aged mice and the effect of NR was blocked by the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin or the SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 (Igarashi et al. 2019). At the same time, data on the effect of the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin, one of the most studied CRMs, on the intestinal stem cells is controversial (He et al. 2020; Igarashi and Guarente 2016; Yilmaz et al. 2012). On the one hand, a recent study showed that mTORC1 is strongly upregulated in the ISC cells in aged mice and mTORC1 inhibition resulted in a partial improvement in aging phenotypes in 16 diet-restriction-induced ISC expansion of one-month-old mice (He et al. 2020). In contrast, Igarashi et al. demonstrated that caloric restriction induces an increase in mTORC1 activity in ISCs leading to the increased cell proliferation, whereas rapamycin suppressed dietary restriction-induced ISC proliferation (Igarashi and Guarente 2016).

The functioning of the hematopoietic stem cells can also be altered by CRMs, especially by the compounds associated with the regulation of mTOR. The importance of mTOR in HSC aging is evidenced by the results of a study that showed that age-related functional decline in HSC is improved in long-lived mTOR mutant mice (Selman et al. 2016). And also in another study, mTOR activity increases in the HSC of mice with aging, and rapamycin at a dose of 4 mg/kg every other day for 6 weeks increased lifespan, restored self-renewal and hematopoiesis of HSC in old mice (22 months) (Chen et al. 2009). An ex vivo study showed that rapamycin treatment inhibited the cellular senescence, possibly through Bmi1 activation and p16 inhibition, and led to the stimulation of ex vivo expansion and long-term hematopoietic repair of HSCs (Luo et al. 2014).

Resveratrol also affects hematopoiesis *in vitro* and *in vivo* (Rimmelé et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2010; Matsui et al. 2012). Rimmelé et al. demonstrated that daily administration of resveratrol (5 mg/kg) for three weeks increased the frequency and the total number of the Lin - Sca1 + c-Kit + (LSK) cells in the bone marrow of the C57BL/6 mice (Rimmelé et al. 2014). In addition, the treatment with the resveratrol improved the state of the LSK-HSC, positively influenced the microenvironment of the bone marrow, and partially corrected the abnormal status of the cell cycle in a mouse model of the Fanconi anemia (Zhang et al. 2010). A similar effect on the same Fanconi model of anemia was demonstrated by metformin, a therapy that led to an improvement in the hematopoiesis, increased the size of the hematopoietic stem cell compartment, and enhanced the rest of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells. Moreover, metformin reduced the DNA damage and improved the spontaneous chromosome breakage in cells (Zhang et al. 2016).

The importance of the autophagy activation when exposed to CRMs on the skeletal mouse stem cells has been shown in a number of studies (Ramos et al. 2012). It was shown that in prematurely senescent mice, the muscle-derived stem/progenitor cells (MDSPCs) exhibit abnormalities in proliferation, chondrogenic, osteogenic, and myogenic differentiation and regenerative potential, and cultivation in the rapamycin-containing media resulted in the improved differentiation and decreased apoptosis and aging (Kawakami et al. 2019).

One of the key regulators of the autophagy is Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), also known as a NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1, the nutrient sensor, so resveratrol as an activator of the Sirt1 can influence the functioning of the satellite cells (Alway et al. 2014). Resveratrol, for example, caused the restoration of muscle mass in the plantar muscle of old rats after hanging the hind limbs, which was associated with the improvement of the satellite cell proliferation in the hind limb muscles (Bennett et al. 2013). On the other hand, the 10-month consumption of the resveratrol had a protective effect against the aging-induced oxidative stress in the skeletal muscles, but did not attenuate sarcopenia in mice (Jackson et al. 2011). This is possible because the effect of resveratrol may depend on its concentration. Resveratrol at low doses (10 μM) caused the myoblast cell cycle stop, migration and promoted the muscle regeneration *in vitro* by attenuating ROS exposure, while higher doses (40–60 μM) suppressed these effects (Bosutti and Degens, 2015).

Metformin, as a regulator of autophagy, also caused the metabolic reprogramming in the fate of the skeletal muscle stem cells. Interestingly, in a recent study by Pavlidou et al. it was shown that unlike resveratrol, metformin did not lead to the activation of Sirt1 in the satellite cells, and contributed to the maintenance of the satellite cells at rest, caused a delay in their differentiation *in vitro* and slowed down the process of muscle regeneration after the cardiotoxin injury *in vivo* (Pavlidou et al. 2019). On the other hand, the metformin improved *in vivo* the regeneration after a burn injury by activating the proliferation of the Pax7-positive satellite cells via the AMPK signalling pathway (Yousuf et al. 2020). The authors suggest that the differences between the two studies are due to the fact, that the burn injury causes systemic inflammation that lasts 2 weeks, as opposed to the shorter exposure to cardiotoxin. In addition, after a burn, animals are more mobile and this affects the muscle regeneration (Yousuf et al. 2020). Moreover, conflicting results have been obtained with the myogenic cell differentiation. On the one hand, it was found that in myoblasts, the metformin-treated MyoD and p21cip1 are not activated, which negatively affects the myogenic differentiation (Pavlidou et al. 2017). In contrast, another study showed that metformin did not affect the proliferation but enhanced the myogenic cell differentiation (Senesi et al. 2016). These results demonstrate the complex nature of the effects of metformin on the muscle stem cells and the need for more detailed studies.

Several studies have shown an association between the changes in polyamine levels in the muscle fibers and the skeletal muscle atrophy and hypertrophy (Lee and MacLean, 2011). It was shown that *in vitro* polyamines (putrescine, spermidine and spermine) cause activation of the satellite cells and the expression of myogenic regulatory factors (Thornton et al. 2013). *in vivo* studies have shown that intraperitoneal injections of spermidine at a dose of 100 mg/kg of body weight every other day for 32 days induced the autophagy in the satellite cells and activated the resting satellite cells in mice (Zhang et al. 2018).

Simulating the effect of calorie restriction on the cardiovascular system is one of the most important properties of mimetics (Sciarretta et al. 2020). An interesting question is how much adult heart stem cells are involved in this process, which can play a central role in the age-related remodeling of the heart (Carresi et al. 2021). Among the known mimetics, the most effective heart stem cell stimulant (CSC) is the resveratrol. The main results were obtained from the studies related to the transplantation of the CSCs for the treatment of myocardial infarction. A study in Sprague–Dawley rats demonstrated that preliminary systemic administration of resveratrol at a concentration of 2.5 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks improved the myocardial tissue environment and increased the survival and proliferation and the differentiation of transplanted CSCs in the area of the myocardial infarction (Gurusamy et al. 2010).

Pre-treatment with resveratrol for 60 min with the CSC before transplantation resulted in the improved cardiac function and enhanced engraftment of the implanted stem cells that had increased the expression of Nrf2, Ref-1 and NFoB (Gorbunov et al. 2012). Resveratrol at a concentration of 2.5 mg/kg per day for 4 weeks was also shown to activate the transplanted Sca-1 + CSC cells in the heart. The authors showed that the upregulation of the VEGF and SDF-1α is the likely mechanism underlying the resveratrol action (Ling et al. 2017). Resveratrol has been shown in several studies to promote the differentiation of the Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells into cardiomyocytes through inhibition of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and the SRF-miR-1 (Liu et al. 2016). It was also shown that the resveratrol concentration of 10 μmol/L was optimal for stimulating the differentiation of the mouse embryonic stem cells into cardiomyocytes (Ding et al. 2016).

Rapamycin also alters the functional properties of the CSCs, which is associated with the importance of mTOR activity for the vital activity of the heart stem cells (Zheng et al. 2017). Several studies have shown that rapamycin effectively accelerates the differentiation of the embryonic stem cells into the cardiomyocytes (Qiu et al. 2017; Lu et al. 2017). Investigations that demonstrate the role of rapamycin regulation of the mTOR activity in the senescent CSCs are important. Studies of the effect of rapamycin on the CSC showed that *in vitro* the treatment of the cells with the rapamycin (10 nM) and resveratrol (0.5 μM) reduced the cellular senescence and IL1β secretion and increased the rate of cell proliferation, due to the mechanisms that were activated by the increased phosphorylation of AMPK. Moreover, this preliminary pharmacological treatment of the old CSCs *in vitro* led to an improvement in their reparative potential *in vivo* (Avolio et al. 2014).

A recent study showed that a treatment with rapamycin (100 nM) markedly improves the cellular functions, attenuates the replicative senescence, and promotes the proliferation of the senescent human cardiac progenitor cells (hCPCs) (Park et al. 2020). In addition, the long-term treatment with rapamycin improves the clonogenic potential and maintains the migration/differentiation capacity of the old hCPCs (Park et al. 2020). It was also shown that the rapamycin pretreatment of mesenchymal stem cells isolated from the rat bone marrow enhances the cardiogenesis and differentiation of the transplanted cells into the cardiomyocytes in a model of myocardial infarction (Li et al. 2020). However, metformin impaired the homing and survival of the MSCs in the heart in the diabetic streptozotocin-induced cardiomyopathy in rats (Ammar et al. 2021).

**25.5 Calorie Restriction Mimetics for Neural Stem Cells and Neurogenesis**

The previous section of the chapter summarized the results of the studies showing that the CR enhances the neurogenesis. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the effects of the mimetics on the neural stem cells and neurogenesis. The available data indicate that the resveratrol has different effects on neurogenesis of a young and healthy organism (Park et al. 2012) under various stress conditions (Madhyastha et al. 2013; Moriya et al. 2011; Shen et al. 2016) and aging (Kumar et al. 2016). Thus, the administration of the resveratrol (1–10 mg/kg) for 14 days inhibited the proliferation and survival of the neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus of the young C57BL/6 mice and reduced the levels of the phosphorylated form of the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (pCREB) and the BDNF in the hippocampus (Park et al. 2012). While in healthy animals resveratrol suppressed the neurogenesis, in rats exposed to embryonic stress, the resveratrol treatment increased the number of neonatal neurons in the hippocampus and the BDNF expression (Madhyastha et al. 2013).

Resveratrol was also shown to stimulate the neurogenesis and mRNA expression of the brain neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus of mice with chronic fatigue (Pavlidou et al. 2019). *in vitro*, the exposure to resveratrol on the neural stem cells after the oxygen–glucose deprivation/reoxygenation leads to the increased cell survival and proliferation, reduces apoptosis and the MDA levels, and also increases the SOD activity, GSH content, and the expression of Nrf2, HO- 1, and NQO1 proteins (Li et al. 2020). Resveratrol also exhibited a two-phase effect on NPCs under the culture conditions (Kumar et al. 2016). While low concentrations of resveratrol (10 μM) induced cell proliferation through the signal pathways associated with the signal-regulated extracellular kinases (ERK) and p38 kinases phosphorylation, the high concentrations (>20 μM) leveled these effects. The administration of resveratrol (20 mg/kg body weight) to old rats (15 months) enhanced the neurogenesis in the region of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (Kumar et al. 2016).

Numerous *in vitro* and *in vivo* studies have confirmed that metformin may be an important regulator of the metabolism and functioning of the brain cells, including the stem cells, and has a great potential in the treatment of the neurodegenerative diseases (Markowicz-Piasecka et al. 2017; Jiang and Liu, 2020). Several studies have shown the activation of the neural stem cells by metformin in the various injuries. It has been shown that metformin causes an activation of the neural stem cells in the spinal cord only in males, and the progenitor cells in both sexes. Exposure to metformin resulted in the improved functional outcomes after trauma in the thoracic spinal cord (Gilbert and Morshead, 2019).

On the other hand, in a study conducted by Ruddy et al. where it was shown that the effect of metformin on the NPCs depended on sensitivity to sex hormones, especially the estradiol, and only females increased the proliferation of progenitor cells. At the same time, the neural stem cells and the neurogenesis were activated to the same extent in both sexes in a model of neonatal stroke (Ruddy et al. 2019). In an another study, it was demonstrated that administration of metformin for 7 days activates the endogenous NPCs, expands the NPC pool, and aids migration and differentiation of the NPCs in the damaged neonatal brain in a hypoxia-ischemic injury model (Dadwal et al. 2015). Using the advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs) model of the neuronal damage, metformin was shown to increase the survival of the human neural stem cells (hNSC) and enhance the expression of the AMPK, PGC1α, NRF-1, and Tfam (Chung et al. 2015).

Metformin preconditioning of the human induced pluripotent stem cells of the neural stem cells prior to the brain transplantation damaged by stroke has also been shown to improve their engraftment and regeneration and recovery after (Ould-Brahim et al. 2018). Activation of the atypical PKC-CBP pathway, which enhances the neurogenesis in the brain of the adult mice, is assumed to be signalling pathways involved in the regulation of the response to the metformin action on NPCs (Wang et al. 2012). In addition, Fatt et al. revealed that the neuronal differentiation of the NPCs extracted from the subventricular zone was enhanced by metformin and depended on the activation of the AMPK-aPKC-CBP pathway (Fatt et al. 2015). Also, the metformin treatment has recently been shown to result in rejuvenation of the oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and the improvement of remyelination in old animals after focal demyelination (Neumann et al. 2019).

The mTOR signaling pathway is a key in the neuronal and glial differentiation processes and the maintenance of the neural stem cell stemness (LiCausi and Hartman 2018). Intra-cerebro-ventricular infusion of rapamycin (0.5 mM) into the left ventricle of mice was shown to reduce the number of proliferating neural stem cells for almost two times within 7 days (Paliouras et al. 2012). In addition, this study showed that rapamycin suppresses the division and differentiation of the neural stem cells *in vitro* and reduces both the size and the number of the neural stem cells grown as neurospheres (Paliouras et al. 2012).

An interesting comparative study of the effect of rapamycin or metformin on the proliferating neural precursor SVZ and DG cells was carried out in mice (Kusne et al. 2014). A 9-week regimen of daily intraperitoneal (ip) injection of rapamycin at a dose of 75 μg/kg (low dose) or 2.5 mg/kg (high dose) has been shown to reduce the proliferation of the neural stem cells in the SVZ region of the brain of adult C57BL/6 J., while a similar regimen of metformin administration at a dose of 200 mg/kg per day did not cause such an effect. A decrease in the proliferation and differentiation was also found under the influence of rapamycin, but not metformin (Kusne et al. 2014).

The study of the mTOR system in the brain during aging showed that the total number of the neural stem cells and their proliferation in the hippocampus sharply decreases with age and this correlates with a decrease in the activity of the mTOR signalling in the old brain, including the NSC (Romine et al. 2015). It was shown that a single injection of rapamycin (10 mg/kg) led to a significant decrease in the number of proliferating cells in the hippocampus in young animals. Also, if activation of the mTOR system with ketamine improved the neurogenesis in the hippocampus, then the joint intraperitoneal injections of ketamine (10 mg/kg) and rapamycin (10 mg/kg) to 12 month old mice reduced the level of proliferation (Romine et al. 2015). Collectively, these data indicate that the use of rapamycin may exacerbate brain aging, and in this aspect the compound is not a calorie restriction mimetic.

Endogenous polyamines play an important role in the neural differentiation, learning and memory (Guerra et al. 2016) and the levels of polyamines in the aging brain gradually decrease as they age (Sigrist et al. 2014). Spermidine and spermin have recently been shown to induce autophagy and inhibit brain aging in the SAMP8 mice (Xu et al. 2020). Perhaps this deceleration is also associated with the effect of spermidine on the neural stem cells, as evidenced by another study, the cultivation of the NPC with spermidine, the cell migration was facilitated, the number of neurites increased and the BDNF expression increased 7 days after the addition of SPD (Signor et al. 2017).

Thus, some of the chemical compounds that are classified as the CRMs undoubtedly have the properties that allow them to mimic calorie restriction, including through the mechanisms associated with the activation of the adult stem cells. However, the impact of the CRMs on stem cells can be both positive and negative depending on the type of stem cells, which is associated with the heterogeneity of the adult stem cells in the body. Moreover, the effects of the CRMs on stem cells can be considered within the concept of hormesis, when the small doses of the CRMs induced the activation of endogenous stem cells, while the large doses suppressed. It should also be noted that the CRMs often have the antioxidant properties, and in high doses they presumably can cause the so-called antioxidant stress in healthy cells and disrupt a normal redox homeostasis, and this, on the contrary, can lead to an accelerated aging (Kornienko et al. 2019).

Apart from that, the responses of the adult stem cells to the mimetics are age and gender dependent, so that they vary greatly from positive to negative. In addition, the state of a niche or tissue microenvironment has a strong influence on the functioning of the adult stem cells, which, under the various stresses and diseases, can modulate the effects of mimetics. The role of the microbiome, which may be involved in mediating the effects of the CRMs on stem cells, remains unexplored. We believe that this direction is the very promising in the development of a further strategy for the use of mimetics. Therefore, further studies are required to determine the role of metabolic reprogramming in the fate of stem cells with the help of mimetics. It has to include more accurate and detailed characterization and understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of the aging process. Moreover, there is a need to elucidate the interaction of the microbiome axis - stem cells and determine the optimal concentrations of mimetics and their combinations. Finally, the search for the new compounds with the most complete properties mimicking calorie restrictions are needed.
