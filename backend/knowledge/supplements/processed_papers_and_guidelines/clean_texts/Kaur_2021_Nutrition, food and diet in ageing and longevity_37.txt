**29.2 Vitamins and Other Micro-nutrients**

Vitamins are often perceived as beneficial, but high doses can be toxic, such as vitamin E, or ineffective, like vitamin C, which is often excreted. Linus Pauling's promotion of high-dose vitamin C for health and cancer treatment lacks definitive scientific support. Selenium, another micro-nutrient, is necessary in small amounts, but supplementation is not recommended in regions like the USA due to potential toxicity.

**29.3 Antioxidants**

The free radical theory of aging suggests antioxidants could slow aging, but evidence does not support this. Antioxidants have not been shown to increase lifespan or prevent diseases like cataracts. Despite this, antioxidants are widely sold online.

**29.4 Other Dietary Supplements**

Many supplements are marketed for longevity, but evidence is often lacking. For example, fermented papaya, promoted by Nobel laureate Luc Montagnier, lacks evidence for anti-aging effects. Supplements should be tested rigorously before being recommended.

**29.6 Dietary Restriction**

Dietary restriction (DR) can improve health markers like weight and cholesterol but may decrease muscle strength and bone density. DR is not recommended for those with a low BMI or the elderly due to risks of undernutrition. It should be practiced under medical supervision.

**29.8 Fasting**

Fasting may have therapeutic benefits, such as improving chemotherapy outcomes, but evidence for longevity benefits is limited. Intermittent fasting is popular but may not be safe for the elderly due to risks of undernutrition. Fasting can increase alertness temporarily, but prolonged fasting can lead to fatigue.

**Conclusions**

A balanced diet with essential nutrients is crucial for health. Supplements and extreme diets often lack evidence and can be risky. A healthy lifestyle with moderate eating and exercise is recommended for longevity.
