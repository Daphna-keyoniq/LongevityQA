**Iodine**

**Benefits and Recommended Use:**
Iodine is an essential micronutrient crucial for maintaining thyroid function and overall health. It plays a significant role as a structural component of thyroid hormones, thyroxine, and triiodothyronine, which are vital for regulating cellular metabolism, growth, and development. Iodine is particularly important during prenatal and early postnatal development, as it regulates neurodevelopment, maturation of the musculoskeletal and respiratory systems, and cognitive function formation. Adequate iodine levels are essential for preventing thyroid disorders and maintaining mental and physical health in adulthood. Additionally, iodine may help prevent and inhibit tumor growth.

**Relevant Demographics:**
- **Age:** Iodine is crucial during prenatal and early postnatal stages for neurodevelopment and system maturation. It is also important in adulthood for maintaining thyroid health and potentially influencing longevity.
- **Health Conditions:** Individuals with iodine deficiency are at risk of goitre, hypothyroidism, and an increased risk of certain cancers.

**Potential Risks or Side Effects:**
Iodine deficiency can lead to adverse health outcomes, including goitre, hypothyroidism, and an increased risk of developing various cancers.
