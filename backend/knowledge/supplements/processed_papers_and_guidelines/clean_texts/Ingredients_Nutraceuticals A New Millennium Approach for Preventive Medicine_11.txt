**4 Hypervitaminosis**

***4.1 Vitamin A and Carotenoids***

Vitamin A is crucial for vision, immune function, and cellular growth. Recommended intake varies by age and gender, generally 600-900 μg/day for adults. Excess intake, known as hypervitaminosis A, can cause liver damage, bone abnormalities, and increased brain pressure. Symptoms include skin rash, nausea, and joint pain. Excessive intake is rare and usually occurs with high-dose supplements. Carotenoids, while not as toxic, can cause skin yellowing and may increase lung cancer risk in smokers.

***4.2 Vitamin B1***

Thiamin is vital for energy metabolism and neuronal function. RDA is 1.1–1.2 mg for adults. Excessive intake is uncommon and usually not hazardous due to its water-soluble nature. Rarely, high doses can cause allergic reactions or digestive disturbances.

***4.3 Vitamin B2***

Riboflavin is important for energy production and antioxidant enzyme function. RDA is 1.3 mg for males and 1.1 mg for females. Excessive intake is generally safe but can cause urine discoloration and mild gastrointestinal disturbances.

***4.4 Vitamin B3***

Niacin is involved in energy metabolism and lipid regulation. RDA is 20 mg/day. Excessive intake can cause flushing, nausea, and abdominal pain.

***4.5 Vitamin B5***

Pantothenic acid is crucial for metabolism and skin health. RDA is 5 mg for adults. High doses may lead to gastrointestinal disturbances.

***4.6 Vitamin B6***

Pyridoxine is involved in metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis. RDA is 1.2–1.3 mg for adults. Excessive intake can cause sensory neuropathy and neurological symptoms.

***4.7 Vitamin B7***

Biotin supports metabolism and structural integrity of nails, skin, and hair. RDA is 30 μg for adults. Excessive intake can cause allergic reactions and interfere with lab tests.

***4.8 Vitamin B9***

Folic acid is vital for DNA synthesis and cell division. RDA is 400 μg for adults. Excessive intake may increase cancer risk and mask vitamin B12 deficiency.

***4.9 Vitamin B12***

Cyanocobalamin is crucial for red blood cell formation and nervous system function. No known toxicity, but high doses can affect lab test results.

***4.10 Vitamin C***

Vitamin C is an antioxidant involved in collagen synthesis and immune function. RDA is 75–90 mg/day for adults. High doses can cause gastrointestinal disturbances and increase kidney stone risk.

***4.11 Vitamin D***

Vitamin D supports calcium and phosphate absorption. RDA is 600–800 IU/day for adults. Excessive intake can cause hypercalcemia and related symptoms.

***4.12 Vitamin E***

Vitamin E is an antioxidant that supports immune function. Excessive intake can increase bleeding risk and cause gastrointestinal symptoms.

***4.13 Vitamin K***

Vitamin K is involved in blood clotting and bone health. RDA is 90–120 μg/day for adults. Excessive intake can interfere with anticoagulants and cause allergic reactions.

**5 Excess Mineral Uptake**

***5.1 Calcium***

Calcium is essential for bone health and muscle function. Excessive intake can cause kidney stones and interfere with absorption of other minerals.

***5.2 Iron***

Iron is crucial for oxygen transport and energy production. Excessive intake can cause oxidative stress and organ damage.

***5.3 Copper***

Copper is important for enzyme function and iron metabolism. Excessive intake can cause toxicity, leading to liver and neurological damage.

***5.4 Zinc***

Zinc is essential for immune function and wound healing. Excessive intake can cause toxicity, leading to gastrointestinal symptoms and copper deficiency.

***5.5 Magnesium***

Magnesium is involved in muscle and nerve function. Excessive intake can cause gastrointestinal symptoms and, in severe cases, cardiac issues.

***5.6 Manganese***

Manganese is involved in metabolism and bone formation. Excessive intake can cause neurological symptoms similar to Parkinson’s disease.

***5.7 Molybdenum***

Molybdenum is a cofactor for enzymes involved in metabolism. Excessive intake can interfere with copper metabolism and cause toxicity.

***5.8 Selenium***

Selenium is crucial for antioxidant enzyme function and thyroid hormone metabolism. Excessive intake can cause selenosis, leading to gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms.

**6 Toxic Effects Associated with Excess Nutrients Intake**

Excessive nutrient intake can lead to various health issues, including obesity, Alzheimer’s disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, renal complications, infertility, and binge eating disorder. Preventive measures include maintaining a balanced diet, monitoring nutrient intake, and being aware of the potential risks associated with excessive consumption.
