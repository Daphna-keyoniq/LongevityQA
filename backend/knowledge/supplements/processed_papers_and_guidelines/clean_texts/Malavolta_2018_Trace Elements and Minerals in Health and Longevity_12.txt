**Abstract** The elderly population is growing rapidly and people with more than 60 years is increasing faster than adults of any younger decades. The mechanisms involved in water and sodium metabolism are complex and change with age; they include vasopressin system, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the action of the natriuretic peptides. Fluid and sodium balance is generally conserved but this homeostasis could be lost due to illness conditions (physical and/or cognitive) and some pharmacological treatments. Consequently, the serum sodium imbalance is one of the most common finding in clinical practice and a major cause of hospital admissions. Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are defined respectively as serum sodium level <135 and >145 mmol/l. Both electrolyte disorders are associated with high morbidity and mortality in humans as well as in animals. At the same time, they are potentially preventable, thus an early diagnosis with the recognition of the underlying causes and a proper management may avoid negative outcomes. This chapter attempts to provide an overview on the age-related changes in the peripheral and central mechanisms that regulate water and sodium homeostasis in humans and animal models. It will describe the clinical manifestations of dehydration and volume overload and it will address the current challenges in diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia and hypernatremia.
