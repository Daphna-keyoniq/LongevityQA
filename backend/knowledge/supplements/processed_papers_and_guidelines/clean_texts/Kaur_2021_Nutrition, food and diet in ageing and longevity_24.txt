**Abstract** The intake of specific nutritional factors, investigated in large epidemiological studies, have long been considered associated with specific health outcomes and prevention of health problems. The advent of the nutritional geroscience field is contributing to reveal how a diverse number of phytochemicals can help to reduce the rate of cell proliferation, enhance cellular function, eradicate senescent cells, or suppress, at varying degrees, their abnormal secretomes, mitigating the extent of damage posed by them in the body. A summary of senotherapeutic biomolecules acting as senolytics and gerosuppressors will be here presented, to strengthen our knowledge that natural compounds present in the diet, when given at the right time, at the right dose and in combination, could extend the duration of health span and the overall lifespan.
