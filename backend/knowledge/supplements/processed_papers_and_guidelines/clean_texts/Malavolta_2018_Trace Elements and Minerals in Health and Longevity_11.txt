**Abstract** The transition metal molybdenum (Mo), with atomic weight 95.9, is the heaviest essential element with an established RDA, and with the lowest intake and blood concentration. Mo activates in humans 4 enzymes. These enzymes are involved in the decomposition of some metabolites, thus enabling their products to be excreted by the kidneys. As well, they decompose many drugs, and consequently affect their pharmacokinetics. This activity is especially important to the elderly people, who consume drugs at escalating rates. The Mo enzyme activities highly depend on the Mo blood concentrations. Mo might interact with other metal ions, and thus affect the enzymatic actions activated by Mo. Lower Mo concentrations (within the regular range) presumably have a physiological preference over the higher concentrations, particularly in type 2 diabetic patients. By eliminating bean consumption, diabetics might decrease dietary Mo intake. Episodes of Mo deficiency and overt toxicity in healthy people are very rare. A routine inclusion of Mo in the marketed ‘multivitamins’ is questionable, because it is not supported by a robust data.
