**Abstract** Circadian rhythms are maintained by the interaction of external environmental cues with bodyâ€™s molecular clock machinery and help to optimize physiological functions by temporally coordinating them at the cellular, tissue, organ and behavioural level of an organism. Feeding-fasting pattern is one of the most important external cues that affect the robustness of the biological rhythms. Upon aging due to loss of indispensable neurons in the master clock- Suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), these rhythms get compromised and so does the temporal coordination thus leading to various age-related pathologies. Irregular eating-fasting patterns can also temporally disrupt the coordination between metabolism and physiology, leading to the onset of many chronic diseases and early aging. Hence, avoiding irregular feeding-fasting habits and maintaining strong rhythmic cycles following optimum amplitude and phase of rhythms can help in healthy aging and preventing diseases such as sleep disorders, cardiovascular, metabolic disorders, diabetes, obesity, breast cancer, inflammation, hypertension, neurodegeneration etc. Therefore, synchronizing the external cues and timings of signals from master clock along with time restricted eating patterns can help in sustaining a robust circadian clock. Such synchronization will help in preventing the diseases and improving their prognosis. In this chapter, we aim to discuss the role of diet in restoration of age-induced circadian dysfunction.
