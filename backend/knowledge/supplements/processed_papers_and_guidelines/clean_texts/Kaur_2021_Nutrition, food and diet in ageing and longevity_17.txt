**13.2 Hydroxytyrosol/hidrox® A Prototypical Polyphenolic Agent for Brain Health**

**13.2.1 Hydroxytyrosol/Hidrox®**

Emerging research has recently focused on brain health benefits of the major olive oil polyphenols, particularly hydroxytyrosol (HT) and hydroxytyrosol (HT)-rich aqueous olive pulp extract (Hidrox®), that at low doses exert multiple preventive and pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-aging, and anti-proliferative effects in vitro and in vivo. Olive oil polyphenols significantly modulate the aging process, tightly connected to oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. Hidrox® is produced from olive vegetation water, normally discarded as wastewater, with an excellent safety profile, high bioavailability, tissue distribution, and multiple mechanisms. Hydroxytyrosol (50–70%) is the main constituent of the pulp extract, with other polyphenols present including oleuropein (5–10%), tyrosol (0.3%), oleuropein aglycone, and gallic acid.

Preclinical studies showed that HT efficiently exerts radical scavenging activities in vitro and significantly increases the expression of antioxidant enzymes extending lifespan in in vivo models of aging. Hidrox® was administered in powder form to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated BALB/c mice by oral gavage, reducing serum TNF-alpha levels by 95% at a dose of 125 mg/mouse (500 mg/kg). OVW did not cause toxic effects in all of the experiments investigated. When OVW was combined with glucosamine, their synergistic effects decreased the inducible nitric oxide synthase production in macrophage cells and serum TNF-α levels in the LPS-treated mice. Purified HT, in comparison, did not induce any reduction of TNF-α.

The beneficial effects of Hidrox® were confirmed by an in vitro study conducted by researchers at DSM in 2011. They used fractionated OVW to identify its anti-inflammatory constituents. The fractions were tested on macrophages stimulated with LPS to evaluate their effect on the inhibition of inflammatory mediators in a hormetic dose–response manner, supporting that HT exerts its anti-inflammatory effects, at least in part, mediated via the NF-kB cellular pathway. Other in vitro studies on endothelial cells and human monocytic cell line have highlighted the ability of HT to downregulate NF-kB activation and its translocation into the nucleus. Animal studies have shown the safety profile of Hidrox®, since given by oral gavage to rats did not appear to induce reproductive and developmental toxicity at the maximum dose of 2000 mg/kg/day.

Human studies demonstrated that HT, in the form of freeze-dry powder, orally administered in 4 capsules/day to 90 patients affected by osteo and rheumatoid arthritis induced a potent anti-inflammatory activity manifested as reduction of swelling, pain, and improved daily motilities with an associated reduction of two inflammation biomarkers, CRP and homocysteine. Other clinical trials tested hydroxytyrosol, in its natural environment (OVW, Olivenol™ or Hidrox®), on 100 healthy volunteers in Malaysia and 50 patients in Japan. In the first study, a single dose (2 ml OWV, 2.5 mg HT) administered orally significantly increased total (reduced and oxidized) glutathione antioxidant levels in plasma. The second study conducted in Japan included patients with high cholesterol levels and confirmed the protective effect of olive polyphenols and HT on lipid profile. Doses as low as 5 mg HT/day produced a remarkable reduction of high MW cholesterol while HDL cholesterol concentration was unchanged or improved. In this study, the same HT dosage of 5–10 mg/daily carried out important improvements in 5 patients with skin disorders, suggesting a potential protective effect of HT on the immune system.

Recent in vivo studies with olive polyphenols, in particular, Hidrox® exerted higher anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects than the same amount of pure HT, improving overall healthspan and longevity as well as stress resistance in a rotenone-stressed PD model of C. elegans and rodents. Recent double-blinded randomized preclinical studies indicated the neuroprotective effect of HT-enriched diet, in particular a dose of 45 mg HT/kg BW/day favors the recovery after ischemic stroke by improving stroke-associated learning and motor impairments. This effect is probably associated with an increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF). HT induces an increase of functional and structural connectivity by enhancing transcription of the postsynaptic density protein 95 (Psd-95) marker, an anti-inflammatory activity by reducing ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA-1) level as well as a neurogenic potential by raising the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in mice. Increasing evidence reported the brain health benefits of HT supplementation that at a dose of (50 mg/kg of diet) improved cognitive functions and reduced Aβ42 and pE3-Aβ plaque in the cortex of TgCRND8 mice. Supplementation of diet rich in olive polyphenols at a dose range of 1 to 10 mg/kg has positive long-term effects on cognition and energy metabolism in the aged brain. A recent interesting evidence has demonstrated the virucidal activity of Hidrox® at a dose of 20 mg/kg by inactivating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in time and concentration dependently, proving once again that Hidrox® is more potent than pure HT.
