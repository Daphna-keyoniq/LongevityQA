**Abstract** For centuries, various feeding regimens have been proposed to live longer with better health. However, in many cases, they have not been proven to have any positive effect, and they can even have negative ones. This chapter reviews the claims of various regimens (e.g., detox diets, fasting). It is doubtful that they could increase human lifespan and improve health, provided one adopts a balanced regime with no excessive intake and avoids junk food.
