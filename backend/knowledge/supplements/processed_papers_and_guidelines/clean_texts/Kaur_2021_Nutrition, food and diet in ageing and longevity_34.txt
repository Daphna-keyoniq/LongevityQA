**Abstract** Ageing is an innate indispensable physiological process largely conceived as general decline in body functions and defense mechanisms. While ageing per se is not a disease, there are many age-related pathologies, modulation of which is considered as anti-ageing in several ways. Chronic stress often triggers senescence-inducing mechanisms manifested as premature/rapid ageing. The latter is associated with a high incidence of stress-related disorders such as cancer, neurodegeneration, metabolic disorders and muscle/bone dysfunctions. Cell culture system provides an easy and convenient experimental system to study mechanisms of natural (replicative) and stress-induced ageing. We, over the years, have researched molecular mechanisms of ageing and age-related pathologies, and their modulation with natural compounds using cell culture as a model system. Among several others, bioactives from Ashwagandha (*Withania somnifera*) have emerged as useful natural compounds with a variety of activities and are hence predicted to assist in health care in stress and disease states. In this chapter, we describe highlights of our research work demonstrating the therapeutic potential of Ashwagandha leaves that offer advantage over roots in terms of availability, processing and being enriched with active compounds.
