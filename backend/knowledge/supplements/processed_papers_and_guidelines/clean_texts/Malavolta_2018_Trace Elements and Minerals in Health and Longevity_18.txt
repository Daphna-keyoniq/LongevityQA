**Relevant Client Demographics:**

- **Age**: Many studies focus on adults, particularly those over 45 years.
- **Gender**: Some studies indicate differences in nutrient needs between genders.
- **Previous Conditions**: Individuals with a history of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) may benefit from adjusted micronutrient levels.

**Potential Risks or Side Effects:**

- Excessive intake of micronutrients can lead to increased relative risks (RR) for morbidity and mortality.
- Specific ranges for each nutrient are crucial to avoid deficiency or toxicity.
