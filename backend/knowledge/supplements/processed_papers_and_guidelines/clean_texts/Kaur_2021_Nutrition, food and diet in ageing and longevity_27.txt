**Shortened Version of the Paper on Supplements**

**Benefits and Recommended Use of Specific Supplements:**
- **Carnosine (β-Ala-His):** Known for its antioxidant effects, carnosine reduces lipid peroxidation products, oxygen anions, and other free radicals, positively affecting body functions.
- **Asn-Leu-Pro-Arg (NLPR) Peptide:** Exhibits neurotrophic effects, potentially improving memory by enhancing nerve growth factor (NGF) expression.
- **Regevil (Vilon, Lys-Glu (KE)) and Epimental (Epitalon, Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly (AEDG)):** These peptides normalize immune and endocrine system functions, increase life expectancy, reduce tumor incidence, promote telomere lengthening, and restore cell activity.

**Relevant Client Demographics:**
- **Epimental® (Epitalon):** Effective for individuals aged 35 to 68 experiencing chronic stress, including jet lag. It improves neuroendocrine function and stress-related symptoms.
- **Regevil® (Vilon):** Suitable for individuals aged 43 to 76 recovering from acute respiratory, bacterial, or viral diseases. It aids in immune system restoration and tissue regeneration.

**Potential Risks or Side Effects:**
- **Epimental® (Epitalon) and Regevil® (Vilon):** No side effects, complications, or drug dependence were identified during clinical studies.

**Recommended Dosages:**
- **Epimental® (Epitalon):** 1 capsule per day with meals for 20 days.
- **Regevil® (Vilon):** 1 capsule per day with meals for 20 days.

**Conclusion:**
The use of dietary supplements based on short peptides like Epimental® (Epitalon) and Regevil® (Vilon) has shown effectiveness in clinical research for maintaining immune and neuroendocrine system functions, with no reported side effects. These supplements are recommended for individuals under prolonged stress or recovering from illnesses to improve overall health and well-being.
