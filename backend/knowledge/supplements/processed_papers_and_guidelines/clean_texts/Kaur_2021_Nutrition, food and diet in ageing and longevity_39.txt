###### **30.5 Nutritional and Dietary Interventions**  
Food is often considered as one of the three pillars of human health and survival – the other two being physical activity, and social and mental engagement. Therefore, manipulating and modifying food components and food habits have always been attractive targets for intervention. This is exemplified by extensive research done on the effects of individual nutrients, short peptides, and plant extracts in stimulating, inhibiting or regulating various molecular pathways in relation to ageing, and age-related diseases, including cancer, in experimental animal model systems and cells in culture *(see chapters 21, 23, 28).* More recently, single-nutrient-based or multiple-nutrients-based selective killing of senescent cells, and calorie restriction mimetics as anti-ageing therapies are being tested and developed *(see chapters 22, 25).* These therapeutic strategies follow the same “one target, one missile” pharmaceutical rationale, and consider ageing as a treatable disease. However, often the promises made, based on the results obtained from such experimental studies, are either naïve extrapolations from experimental model systems or overhyped claims for human applications, which deliver very little in reality (Rattan 2020) *(see chapter 29).*

Some other innovative, holistic and relatively easy to implement food- and diet-based interventions strategies are caloric/dietary restriction and time restricted eating (TRE) regimens. For example, intermittent fasting (IF), based on feeding/fasting timing manipulation, is emerging as a promising intervention to promote health and longevity. Meta-analyses of several pilot studies in human subjects show that TRE, with eating restricted to a few hours in the day time, has beneficial effects on several health parameters (Mattson et al. 2014) ( *see chapter 24* ). Similarly, several other practical recommendations are made for the optimal nutrition in old age ( *see* *chapter 26* ), and for the regulation of metabolic syndromes, especially metabesity ( *see chapter, 27* ). 

**30.6 Conclusions and Suggestions**  
Food is more than just being one of the three pillars of health. Food is both the foundation and the scaffolding for the building and survival of an organism on a daily basis. Scientific research on the macro- and micro-nutrient components of food has developed deep understanding of their molecular, biochemical and physiological roles. Various recommendations are repeatedly made and modified for some optimal daily requirements of nutrients for maintaining and enhancing health, and for the prevention and treatment of diseases. Can one envisage developing a “nutrition pill” for perfect health, which could be used globally, across cultures, and at all ages? We don’t think so.  

So far, most of our knowledge about nutrients comes from the experimental studies made with individual active components, or, at best, with the combination of one or two compounds. However, in reality, we obtain these nutrients from the food where they exist together with hundreds of other interacting compounds, and become modified through the process of cooking and preservation. Scientifically, there is very little known about the health-related effects of innumerable combinations of food sources, cooking methods, dietary combinations and other factors. However, there is a lot of folk knowledge available in all cultures about the dos and don’ts of food, for which we need scientific verification and validation. For this purpose, we must rethink and modify our presently established scientific protocols of double blinded randomized control trials which are practically impossible to apply on food and dietary research at the population level.

Finally, nutrition, food and diet are the basis of life, health and longevity. We have gathered a huge amount of information with respect to what nutrition is required for health and survival, which foods can provide what nutrition and to what extent, and which dietary and eating practices seem to be more or less health beneficial. Whereas in some parts of the world, abundant availability and accessibility of food has led to its overuse, abuse and consequent life-style diseases, in other parts of the world economic disparity and food scarcity keep perpetuating starvation, malnutrition, poor health and shortened lifespan. It is usually not the lack of knowledge about the optimal nutrition, food and diet that forces us to make bad choices; rather it is either our inability to access such foods, or our gullibility to fall prey to the exaggerated claims in the commercial interests of the food companies, which determine what and how much we consume. Science will and must continue to gather more information about the biochemical, physiological and other aspects of food, which we should apply wisely and globally for the health and longevity of all.
