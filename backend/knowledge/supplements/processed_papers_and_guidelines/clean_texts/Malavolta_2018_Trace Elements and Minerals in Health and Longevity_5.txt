**Selenium**

Selenium is a micronutrient essential for life, known for its dual role in human health as both beneficial and potentially toxic. It is a key component of selenoproteins, which include glutathione peroxidases, thioredoxin reductases, and iodothyronine deiodinases. These proteins are involved in various biological functions such as:

- Defense against oxidative stress
- Maintenance of cellular redox status
- Redox signaling
- Thyroid hormone metabolism

Selenium's role in human health extends to immune and anti-inflammatory reactions, cell proliferation and apoptosis, thyroid hormone activation and inactivation, fertility mechanisms, and detoxification of harmful substances. It also exhibits protective effects against cancer, making adequate dietary selenium intake essential for health and protection against diseases and age-related disorders.

**Client Demographics:**

- Relevant for individuals concerned with oxidative stress, thyroid health, immune function, and cancer prevention.
- Particularly important for populations at risk of selenium deficiency or those with increased oxidative stress, such as older adults or individuals with specific health conditions.

**Potential Risks:**

- High exposure to selenium can have adverse health effects due to its narrow margin between essential and toxic levels.

**Recommended Dosages:**

- The paper does not specify exact dosages, but emphasizes the importance of adequate dietary intake to avoid deficiency and toxicity.
