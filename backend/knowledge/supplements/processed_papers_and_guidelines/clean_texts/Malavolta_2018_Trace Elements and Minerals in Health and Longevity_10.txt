The text provided is a comprehensive discussion on the role of boron as a supplement in aging and longevity. Below is a condensed version focusing on the benefits, recommended usage, demographics, risks, and dosages of boron supplementation:

### Benefits of Boron Supplementation
- **Longevity and Aging**: Boron may influence aging and longevity by affecting NAD[+] and SAM formation, metabolism, and activity. It has been shown to modulate oxidative and inflammatory stress, which are associated with aging.
- **Inflammatory and Oxidative Stress**: Boron can decrease inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukins, which are linked to aging and chronic diseases.
- **Cognitive Function**: Boron supplementation has been associated with improved cognitive function, potentially by modulating oxidative stress and homocysteine levels.
- **Bone Health**: Boron is beneficial for bone health, enhancing bone formation and maintenance, and improving bone density.
- **Cancer**: Boron may reduce the risk of certain cancers, such as prostate and cervical cancer, by alleviating inflammatory and oxidative stress.
- **Sarcopenia**: Boron influences hormones like estrogen and testosterone, which may help mitigate age-related muscle loss.

### Recommended Usage and Dosages
- **Dosage**: A boron intake between 1.0 and 3.0 mg/day is considered adequate for obtaining benefits related to aging and longevity. This dosage is well below the upper intake level (UL) of 20 mg/day for adults in the United States and Canada.
- **Sources**: Boron can be obtained from foods of plant origin, such as fruits, leafy vegetables, nuts, legumes, and pulses. Beverages like wine, beer, and cider are also good sources.

### Relevant Demographics
- **Age**: The benefits of boron supplementation are particularly relevant for older adults, as it may help mitigate age-related conditions such as cognitive decline, bone health issues, and sarcopenia.
- **Gender**: Postmenopausal women may benefit from boron supplementation due to its effects on estrogen metabolism and bone health.
- **Health Conditions**: Individuals with chronic inflammatory conditions, cognitive decline, or at risk for certain cancers may find boron supplementation beneficial.

### Potential Risks and Side Effects
- **Safety**: Boron is relatively non-toxic when consumed in recommended amounts. The safe upper intake level is set at 20 mg/day for adults, with no significant adverse effects reported at this level.
- **Toxicity**: Excessive intake beyond the UL may pose health risks, although specific toxic effects are not detailed in the text.

This summary highlights the potential benefits and safe usage of boron as a supplement for promoting health and longevity, particularly in older adults.
