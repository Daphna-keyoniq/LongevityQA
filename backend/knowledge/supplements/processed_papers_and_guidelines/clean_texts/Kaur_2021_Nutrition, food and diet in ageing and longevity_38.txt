**Abstract** Here we recapitulate the main themes of the issues related to nutrition, food and diet discussed in the twenty-nine chapters in this book. The insights from various contributions have been extracted to conceptualize how nutritional components are not only the source of building blocks and energy for the body, but also serve numerous critical functions in maintaining health. This wealth of information can be useful for making recommendations and suggestions for food for health and longevity, especially in old age. A central message derived from this collection of articles is that optimizing our nutrition by making the right choice of food, and aligning our eating behaviors with our bio-social rhythms, are the most effective general strategies to maintain, recover and enhance individual- and public-health.
