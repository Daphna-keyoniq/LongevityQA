**Abstract** Indian traditional foods emphasize not only on providing the energy needs of the body but also aim to improve the overall health and prevent diseases in the Indian population. Indian traditional diets which are predominantly vegetarian majorly comprise of whole grains, pulses, nuts, vegetables, fruits, spices, herbs, dairy products, and fermented foods which themselves can be considered as ‘functional’ being high in a variety of phytochemicals with nutraceutical potential. 

The major classes of bioactives/phytochemicals present in the Indian traditional foods along with their health benefits have been included and examples of traditional Indian foods with potential as functional foods have been specified. This awareness of traditional wisdom behind healthful properties of traditional foods has opened up many new avenues for scientific investigations which can lead to validation and proper documentation of the claims made.
