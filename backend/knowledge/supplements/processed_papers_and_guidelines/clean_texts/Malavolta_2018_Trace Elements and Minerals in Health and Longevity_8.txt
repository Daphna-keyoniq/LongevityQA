**Abstract** Trivalent chromium is essential to normal carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism. Chromium is biologically active as part of an oligopeptide—chromodulin—potentiating the effect of insulin by facilitating insulin binding to receptors at the cell surface. With chromium acting as a cofactor of insulin, Cr activity in the organism is parallel to insulin functions. Cr(III) can help enhance the role of insulin, the critical hormone that controls blood sugar and helps bring glucose into cells where it’s used for bodily energy. Chromium deficiency has been suggested to lead to symptoms associated with adult-onset diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and these supplements have recently found potential as therapeutic agents in the treatment of adult-onset diabetes.

In addition to its role in glucose and lipid metabolism, chromium also functions as an antioxidant. Chromium(III) protects the organism from oxidative stress associated with reactive oxygen species. These ROS, extremely reactive chemical molecules, are considered toxic and produce oxidative damage to various cellular components, causing cellular dysfunction that accompanies the aging process. The anti-aging effect of chromium is undoubtedly related to the effect of chromium on insulin action. Chromium in a utilizable form, like dietary restriction, prevents hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, protein glycation, and extends lifespan.

Because the body’s ability to control blood glucose is critical to many life functions, a consequence of Cr supplementation can be improved health and reproductive outcomes as well as improved survival rate or lifespan.

**Relevant Demographics**: The information is particularly relevant for individuals at risk of or suffering from adult-onset diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This may include older adults or those with a family history of these conditions.

**Potential Risks**: Cr(VI) is one of the few carcinogenic metals that directly reacts with DNA, forming adducts, and inducing mutations. It is difficult to distinguish between the effects caused by chromium(VI) and those caused by chromium(III) since chromium(VI) is rapidly reduced to chromium(III) after penetration of biological membranes and in the gastric environment.

**Recommended Dosages**: The text does not specify recommended dosages for chromium supplements.
