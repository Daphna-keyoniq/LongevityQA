**Abstract** Inflammageing underlies ageing- and age-related chronic diseases, while age-related chronic diseases also underpin inflammageing and ageing. It is observed that fruits, vegetables, olive oil, fish oil, whole grains, legumes, nuts, flavonoid-rich green tea, carotenoids, omega-3 fatty acids, fibre, and pre- and pro-biotics can inhibit these mechanisms and promote the prevention of chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases that underpin inflammageing and ageing. However, the studies are mostly in vitro and in vivo animal model studies. Thus, there is a need for more prospective and clinical studies on anti-inflammatory foods in ageing and longevity. Even though there are scarce human studies on benefits of these potential anti-inflammatory effects in ageing and longevity, adopting a Mediterranean dietary pattern and recommended consumption amounts can be suggested.
