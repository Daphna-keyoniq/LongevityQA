**Zinc**

- **Benefits and Recommended Use**: Zinc plays a critical role in biology due to its chemical affinity for cellular thiol, imidazole, and carboxyl ligands. It is involved in maintaining zinc homeostasis, which is crucial for various biological functions. Zinc supplementation may impact health and diseases, particularly in the context of aging and age-related diseases. It is associated with the insulin and insulin growth factor (IIS) pathway, which has implications for aging.

- **Relevant Demographics**: The information is particularly relevant for aging populations, as age-related changes can affect zinc intake, metabolism, excretion, and homeostasis. Zinc dyshomeostasis is linked to immunosenescence, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and frailty.

- **Potential Risks or Side Effects**: The text does not explicitly mention the risks or side effects of zinc supplementation, but it implies that maintaining zinc homeostasis is crucial, suggesting that imbalances could have negative effects.

- **Recommended Dosages**: The text does not provide specific recommended dosages for zinc supplementation. Further research and consultation with healthcare professionals would be necessary to determine appropriate dosages based on individual needs and health conditions.
