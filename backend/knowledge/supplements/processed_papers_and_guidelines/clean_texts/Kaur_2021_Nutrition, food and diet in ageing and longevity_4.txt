**Abstract** Ageing is a biological process that can be described as the accumulation of molecular damage to cells in response to stress. A tendency in modern society is to optimize longevity by trying to minimize a physical and mental decline and to decrease susceptibility to disease. There are some nutritional factors, including micronutrients, which can support this process of successful ageing. Micronutrients are vitamins (e.g., A, B group, C, D, E, folate) and minerals (e.g., copper, iron, magnesium, selenium, zinc), needed in small amounts but essential for healthy living. They have numerous significant functions in the organism as antioxidants, coenzymes, cofactors in metabolism, and genetic control. Therefore, micronutrients contribute to the normal functions of the immune, nervous, and endocrine system, protect the organism from oxidative stress, thus contributing to longevity and successful ageing. The dietary intake of micronutrients is usually insufficient in the elderly due to low income, reduced mobility, oral health problems, intestinal malabsorption, presence of chronic diseases, and changes in cognition. The result is an inadequate status of micronutrients which may contribute to suppressed immunity and consequent predisposition to infections, cognitive decline, neurodegeneration, development of the cardiovascular disease, disturbance of immune response and other health disorders.
