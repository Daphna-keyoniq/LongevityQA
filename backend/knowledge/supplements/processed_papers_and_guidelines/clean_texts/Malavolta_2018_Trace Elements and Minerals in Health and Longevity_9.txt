**Abstract** Substantial indirect evidence supports the suggestion that boron promotes healthy aging and longevity. Boron affects the formation and activity of NAD[+] and SAM, which influence aging and longevity. Boron has beneficial effects on inflammatory and oxidative stress, DNA damage detection and repair, and SAM involvement in methylation and homocysteine levels. Nutritional intakes of boron have been shown to moderate or alleviate several pathological conditions associated with aging, including cancer, cognitive decline, sarcopenia, and bone health. These findings indicate that a diet rich in boron will promote healthy aging and longevity.
