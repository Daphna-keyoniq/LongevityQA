**28.1 Introduction**

The global increase in the aging population and environmental stress are major concerns, affecting quality of life (QOL) especially in the elderly. Supplements enriched with natural compounds like antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, and anti-stress ingredients help maintain body homeostasis and brain health, thus extending lifespan. Ashwagandha, known as the "Queen of Ayurveda," is used in traditional Indian medicine for its anticancer, antistress, and neurodegenerative pathology remedial potential.

**28.3 Cellular Stress as an Experimental Model**

Natural compounds that prevent or revert stress-induced molecular changes are referred to as anti-aging compounds. Ashwagandha's withanolides, such as Withanone and Withaferin A, have shown selective toxicity to cancer cells and protective effects against oxidative stress in normal cells.

**28.4 Ashwagandha - Bioactivities Discovered in Cell Culture Models**

Ashwagandha (*Withania somnifera*) is known for its rejuvenating, mood-stabilizing, aphrodisiac, anti-diabetic, anticancer, antihypertensive, and immunomodulatory properties. It is rich in withanolides, which have been validated for their anticancer, anti-stress, and neuroprotective activities.

**28.5 Anticancer Activity—Experimental Evidence**

Ashwagandha extracts, particularly those with high Withanone content, exhibit selective toxicity to cancer cells by activating the p53 tumor suppressor pathway. Withaferin A (Wi-A) and Withanone (Wi-N) are key components responsible for these effects. Wi-A is cytotoxic to both cancer and normal cells, while Wi-N selectively targets cancer cells.

**28.6 Antistress Bioactives and their Bioactivities**

Ashwagandha's adaptogenic activities promote balance in the body and help manage stress. Withanone has shown anti-aging effects by delaying senescence in normal human fibroblasts and protecting against oxidative stress. 3β-Methoxy Withaferin A (mWi-A) lacks cytotoxic effects and protects normal cells against various stresses.

**28.6.3 Bioactive: Triethylene Glycol**

Triethylene glycol (TEG) in Ashwagandha leaves induces sleep and may be useful for insomnia therapy, a common age-related disorder.

**28.6.4 Bioactivity: Anti-neurodegenerative**

Ashwagandha protects against neuro-inflammation and neurodegeneration, promoting neural plasticity and memory functions. It is recommended for cognitive disorders and memory enhancement.

**28.6.5 Anti-diabetic**

Ashwagandha withanolides possess anti-hyperglycemic activity, stimulating insulin release and inhibiting enzymatic activities involved in starch degradation. Clinical studies suggest benefits in reducing serum cholesterol and triglycerides in hyperlipidemic patients.

**Conclusion**

Ashwagandha-derived withanolides offer anticancer and anti-stress benefits, contributing to healthy aging. The purposeful consumption of Ashwagandha should consider the amount and ratio of active withanolides, which vary in different plant parts.
