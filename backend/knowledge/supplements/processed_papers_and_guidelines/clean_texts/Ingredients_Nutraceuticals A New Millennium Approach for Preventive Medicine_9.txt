**Nutraceuticals and Infertility**

**4 Nutrients and Infertility**

Nutrients play a pivotal role in fertility for both men and women. Proper nutrition is crucial for the optimal operation of the reproductive system and overall health. A balanced and varied diet, along with a healthy lifestyle, can help ensure adequate nutrient intake for reproductive health. Nutrient deficiencies have been linked to a higher risk of infertility. Beyond achieving a balance in macronutrients, the specific sources and quantities of individual micronutrients are crucial, as they dictate the impact of diet on fertility.

**4.1 Macronutrients**

**4.1.1 Fats**

The prevention of fertility-related issues is significantly influenced by both the quantity and quality of consumed fatty acids. Saturated fats (SFAs) and trans fatty acids, abundant in processed foods, have adverse effects on fertility. Conversely, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), found in vegetable foods and fish, have positive effects on fertility. Trans fatty acids induce insulin resistance and are linked to infertility-related conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome. In men, trans and saturated fats negatively affect sperm parameters, while omega-3 PUFAs are associated with better seminal parameters.

**4.1.2 Proteins**

The origin and quality of protein intake are important for fertility. Excessive animal protein intake is associated with ovulatory disorders in women and poor sperm quality in men. Plant-based proteins are linked to better fertility outcomes. Red meat, especially processed, is inversely related to semen quality and increases the risk of endometriosis in women.

**4.1.3 Carbohydrates**

Insulin plays a role in infertility, with high glycemic index foods linked to insulin resistance and endocrine disturbances. Low-glycemic diets improve fertility-related parameters. High consumption of sweetened drinks negatively affects sperm motility and pregnancy rates. Indigestible carbohydrates like fiber may increase conception probability.

**4.2 Micronutrients**

Micronutrients are essential for reproductive health. They include vitamins (A, C, E, folate, B12) and minerals (iron, selenium, zinc). Excessive supplement intake can have adverse effects.

- **Selenium**: Vital for spermatogenesis and DNA protection. Deficiency or excess affects fertility and pregnancy outcomes.
- **Zinc**: Important for testosterone synthesis and oocyte quality. Deficiency affects sperm function and oocyte maturation.
- **Iron**: Necessary for spermatogenesis and sperm metabolism. Deficiency or overload affects fertility and reproductive health.
- **Folic Acid (Vitamin B9)**: Essential for DNA synthesis and cell division. Deficiency linked to fertility problems and pregnancy complications.
- **Vitamin E**: Antioxidant that improves sperm motility and oocyte maturation.
- **Vitamin A**: Important for spermatogenesis and oocyte maturation.
- **Vitamin C**: Antioxidant that improves sperm quality and ovarian function.
- **Vitamin D**: Regulates reproductive processes and improves metabolic disturbances in PCOS.
- **Vitamin B12**: Enhances sperm quality and prevents pregnancy complications.

**4.3 Caffeine**

Caffeine consumption may adversely affect male fertility, but studies are inconclusive. In women, high caffeine intake is linked to an increased risk of spontaneous abortion.

**Conclusions**

Infertility is a complex issue influenced by clinical conditions and lifestyle factors, including diet. A diet rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and healthy fats, while avoiding processed and saturated fats, may improve fertility outcomes. Maintaining body weight and promoting physical activity are key to improving fertility. Integrating nutrition advice into infertility treatment is recommended.
