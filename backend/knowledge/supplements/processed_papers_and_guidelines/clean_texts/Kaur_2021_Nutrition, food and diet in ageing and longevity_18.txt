**Abstract** During ageing, losses in muscle mass and muscle strength are common. Unfavourable changes in muscle architecture and neurological activation of muscle tissue decrease the unit-specific muscular output, also known as muscle quality. Together, the losses in the muscular domains lead to lower physical functioning and thereby jeopardise oneâ€™s independence and quality of life. This chapter explains the age-related declines in muscle mass and quality, and how nutrition and exercise can be strategically used to prevent and counter these declines. Due attention is given to the role of nutrition and exercise in light of age-related syndromes and critical life events where muscular losses are accelerated.
