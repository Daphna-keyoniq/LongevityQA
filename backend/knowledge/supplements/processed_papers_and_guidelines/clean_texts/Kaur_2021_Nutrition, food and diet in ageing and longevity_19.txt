**Supplements and Their Benefits:**

- **Oral Nutritional Supplementation (ONS):** Effective in increasing body weight and improving physical condition in malnourished individuals. Contains macro- and micronutrients, including whey protein, leucine, HMB, ursolic acid, and vitamin D. Recommended for older adults, especially those at risk of malnutrition, sarcopenia, and frailty.

- **Protein and Leucine:** Recommended for sarcopenia treatment, especially when combined with resistance exercise. Beneficial for older adults with muscle mass and function decline.

- **Vitamin D:** Supports muscle function and is protective against falls. Recommended for older adults, particularly those with frailty or sarcopenia.

- **Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** Improve muscle mass and function, especially when combined with protein. Beneficial for older adults, particularly those with sarcopenia.

- **B Vitamins (B6, B12, Folate):** Lower homocysteine levels, potentially improving physical functioning. Relevant for older adults to preserve functional capacities.

- **Creatine:** Improves neuromuscular activation and muscle strength. Recommended for older adults to enhance muscle function.

- **Ursolic Acid:** Promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and muscle mass. Potentially beneficial for older adults to prevent muscle atrophy.

**Client Demographics:**

- Older adults, particularly those with malnutrition, sarcopenia, frailty, or at risk of muscle mass and function decline.

**Potential Risks or Side Effects:**

- Overconsumption of supplements can lead to adverse effects. Monitoring and appropriate dosage are crucial.

**Recommended Dosages:**

- Dosages vary based on individual needs and specific supplements. Professional guidance is recommended for personalized dosage plans.
