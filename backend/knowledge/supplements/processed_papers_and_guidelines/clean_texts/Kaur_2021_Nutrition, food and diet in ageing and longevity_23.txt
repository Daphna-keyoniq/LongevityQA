**Abstract** Nutrition (diet composition and eating regimen) is one of the key factors of longevity. A balanced diet allows you to avoid essential nutrient deficiencies and hazardous substances to metabolic health. A healthy diet, containing enough dietary fibers, polyphenols, and metabiotics, maintains an optimal quantitative and qualitative balance of the microbiota. Aging is a complex of chronic inflammation and stress processes, so anti-inflammatory nutrients, antimutagens, and hormetins are an integral part of a longevity diet. One of the factors of inflammation is a hyperglycemic diet. Controlling the levels of simple carbohydrates (glucose, fructose, galactose) in the diet can reduce the level of glycation in tissues, which is a fundamental mechanism of aging. Several biologically active substances in food are capable of targeted suppression of aging-associated signaling pathways and activating pro-longevity stress-resistance. Diet personalization is the future of preventive medicine, taking into account markers of metabolic health, the nutritional density of the diet, and markers of biological age.
