**Abstract** The role of nutrition in health has fascinated humans for millennia.  
Currently, there is a substantial body of research guiding better practices to prevent or treat age-related conditions through nutritional interventions. Chronic degenerative conditions such as cardiovascular disease, sarcopenia and frailty, diabetes, cancer, osteoporosis, prostatic hyperplasia, menopause, age-related macular degeneration and many others, are amenable to nutritional interventions which, in association with specific treatments, may help alleviate the burden of the disease. Nutritional principles can also be applied for the prevention of each condition. In this chapter, there is a presentation regarding some of these principles, mainly focusing on the latest findings in each case. The aim is not to discuss all diets and nutrients suitable for each condition, but rather to use nutrition as a pretext to elucidate some biological mechanisms and processes involved in age-related degeneration. Certain intricacies of chronic degeneration, inflammation, oxidative damage and other age-related processes are at the heart of this discussion, which also examines the action of a number of nutrients or nutritional supplements. It is important to highlight that due to the fact that age-related diseases are multifactorial, it is necessary to employ a multi-pronged approach, tailored to the needs of each patient.
