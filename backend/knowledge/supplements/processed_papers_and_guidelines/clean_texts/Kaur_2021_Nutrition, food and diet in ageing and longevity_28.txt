**Abstract** Intermittent fasting (IF) is widely practiced for health benefits among people of various societies by adopting regimens which vary in terms of dietary patterns and duration of fast. Also, sustained periods of caloric restriction (CR) without malnutrition have been shown to be a potent modulator of lifespan resulting in lower incidence of metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurological disorders. IF regimens such as alternate day fasting, time-restricted feeding, protein restriction, etc., have recently emerged as potential alternate approaches to CR which do not involve any major changes in quality and quantity of nutritional intake. This chapter reviews the different regimens of IF and CR used in model organisms and in humans to ascertain their efficacy for metabolic fitness, resistance to age-related diseases, and longevity as well as their underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms. Moreover, promoting health-oriented and disease preventive approaches are more viable options for healthy aging and longevity than continuing with disease-oriented research and therapeutic strategies.
