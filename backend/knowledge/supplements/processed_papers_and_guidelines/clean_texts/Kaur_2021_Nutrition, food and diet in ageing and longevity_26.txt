**Abstract** This book chapter outlines the physiological and molecular mechanisms of metabolism of short peptides as well as its role in maintenance of homeostasis. Many of short peptides for oral use do not decompose in the gastrointestinal tract and absorb unchanged. Such peptides, which do not hydrolyze in a gastrointestinal tract, get to a blood plasma and then to various tissues and organs. Short peptides permeate through cytoplasmic membrane into the nucleus and nucleolus of a cell, where they able to bind to DNA and to regulate gene expression epigenetically. Interaction DNA-peptide probably is the earliest evolution form. It gives explanation of high biological activity and absolute safety of short peptides, and itsâ€™ successful use in form of substance endowed with significant physiological effect.
