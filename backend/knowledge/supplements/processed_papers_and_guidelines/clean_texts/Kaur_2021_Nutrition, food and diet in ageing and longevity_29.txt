**Abstract** The regulation of nutrition and metabolism plays a pivotal role in regulating the aging process. The nutrition is a critical external factor influencing the development of aging and associated disorders. One of the well-known dietary interventions to slow aging and reduce mortality is calorie restriction. The results of the range of studies indicate that calorie restriction facilitates the increase in life expectancy and a decrease in the aging processes. The effect of calorie restriction on the aging process has been associated with a wide range of the reactions in different types of cells, particularly the stem cells. This Chapter discusses the role of the stem cells in aging processes and associated disorders in the context of calorie restriction strategies. It encompasses the analysis of the results of preclinical and clinical studies on the relationship between the calorie restriction and adult stem cell function in order to understand the effects of calorie restriction on the health and longevity. The Chapter highlights the role of stem cells in neurogenesis, alterations in stem cell function under the influence of calorie restriction. In addition, the potential of the calorie restriction mimetics as aging modulators has been discussed too.
