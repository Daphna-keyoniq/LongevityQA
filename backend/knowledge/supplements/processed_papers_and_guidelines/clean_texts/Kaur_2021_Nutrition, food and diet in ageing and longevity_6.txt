**Abstract** Probiotics and prebiotics have been reported to be useful in maintaining health and ameliorating various disease conditions. This chapter provides insights into the beneficial role of various probiotics and prebiotics along with their probable mechanisms of action. Several pieces of evidence from clinical trials and *in-vitro* studies have been presented and discussed in this chapter specifically in relation to ageing, longevity and general well-being of an individual. Probiotics have been reported to significantly enhance the skin elasticity, moisture content and gloss with a reduction in wrinkle depth which are all aging related consequences. These biotics increase antioxidants levels with decreased hair loss, skin ulcers and age-related inflammation. It promotes the number of mitochondria in cell and extends the lifespan. Also, they display a beneficial role in the prevention of abdominal pain, diarrhoea, diabetes mellitus, infant colic, irritable bowel syndrome, *C. difficile* infection and ulcerative colitis. On the other hand, prebiotics is known for elevating the antioxidant enzyme levels thereby minimizing harmful reactive radicals and increase immuno-regulatory cytokines which may further impart double protection when given with the right combination of probiotics. The results from several studies reflect the potential of these biotics in various therapeutic interventions, albeit it is also recommended to the researcherâ€™s community to plan and execute active surveillance to understand other side effects associated with the usage of these biotics.
