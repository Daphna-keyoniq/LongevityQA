Rapidly changing demographics worldwide towards increased proportion of the
elderly in the population and increased life-expectancy have brought the issues,
such as “why we grow old”, “how we grow old”, “how long can we live”, “how to
maintain health”, “how to prevent and treat diseases in old age”, “what are the
future perspectives for healthy ageing and longevity” and so on, in the centre stage
of scientific, social, political, and economic arena. Although the descriptive aspects
of ageing are now well established at the level of species, populations, individuals,
and within an individual at the tissue, cell and molecular levels, the implications of
such detailed understanding with respect to the aim of achieving healthy ageing and
longevity are ever-changing and challenging issues. This continuing success of
gerontology, and especially of biogerontology, is attracting the attention of both the
well established academicians and the younger generation of students and
researchers in biology, medicine, bioinformatics, bioeconomy, sports science, and
nutritional sciences, along with sociologists, psychologists, politicians, public
health experts, and health-care industry including cosmeceutical-, food-, and
lifestyle-industry. Books in this series will cover the topics related to the issues of
healthy ageing and longevity. This series will provide not only the exhaustive
reviews of the established body of knowledge, but also will give a critical
evaluation of the ongoing research and development with respect to theoretical and
evidence-based practical and ethical aspects of interventions towards maintaining,
recovering and enhancing health and longevity.

#### Preface

Biological aging is a complex phenomenon consisting of loss of vitality and
increased vulnerability that still lacks a shared definition and deep understanding. It
is hypothesized that it can be originated by the decline of the force of natural
selection with chronological age or that it is the consequence of a selection of traits
that benefits a population or an ecosystem even if they are adverse to individual
members. In a biological perspective, this mean that aging can be driven by the
gradual accumulation of random molecular and cellular damage or that it is
determined by a programmed process involving hundreds or thousands of genes
acting with the purpose to eliminate older individuals from the population. Aging is
also considered as a process that occurs independently by the disease of aging, by
some scientists, or as the root cause of age-related diseases by others. In any case,
aging remains the major cause of suffering and death worldwide and the proportion
of the population affected by disabling chronic illness of aging is constantly
increasing.
In this context, the development of treatments able to improve health and extend
life span is highly desirable. A complete understanding of the underlying process of
aging may be not necessary to start planning interventions able to reverse part of the
damage that accumulates with aging, but the impact of these treatments may result
to be minimal in terms of life- and health-span extension if we are not able to
clearly disentangle beneficial compensatory phenomena that arise to counteract the
damage associated with aging from the damage itself. A representative example of
what this mean may be offered by the case of amyloid beta in Alzheimer’s disease.
By one side, amyloid plaques have been considered as the cause of damage, and by
another side, they are considered as a protective response to other underlying causes
of the disease, so that the removal of amyloid may even worsen the disease.
Unfortunately, the way most intracellular signaling pathways influence aging at a
biochemical and metabolic level is still largely unknown. Under a certain point of
view, it may appear a paradox that in the twenty-first century, we are still not able to
definitively answer the question what is aging and why we age.

vi Preface

With this book, we would like to contribute to the efforts made in the attempt to
clarify the mysteries that control aging by focusing on a specific aspect of this
process. A common feature of aging, which is frequently used to define the process
of aging itself, is the loss of homeostasis (the ability to maintain internal stability in
the presence of challenges) with time. In this context, it should be noted that there
are various homeostatic systems which, in turn, are differently affected by aging.
One of these systems is metal homeostasis (metallostasis), which is kept by a
multitude of binding, buffering, and transport proteins that are highly affected by
aging. The age-related loss of metallostasis appears to be a conserved phenomenon
across multiple species, and there is substantial evidence that alterations in metal
abundance modulate life span in humans as well as in most common animal models
used in aging studies, such as rats, mice, worms, and flies.
This multi-chapter review book presents the present state of knowledge on the
role of minerals and trace elements in health, aging, and longevity. The book is
divided into 11 chapters, each dedicated to a specific mineral or trace element and a
final chapter dedicated to the optimal and the nadir ranges of the micronutrients. All
chapters have a title dedicated to a mineral or element: iron, copper, selenium, zinc,
chromium, molybdenum, sodium, magnesium, and iodine. Each chapter consists of
an in-depth review on the impact of each mineral or element on molecular and
physiological processes of aging, with a focus on clinical, animal, and other laboratory models of interest in aging.
Engrained with the up-to-date information about role of trace elements and
minerals in health, aging, and longevity, this collection is a valuable addition to the
book series “Healthy Ageing and Longevity” and provides a reliable source of
information and knowledge useful for understanding and developing potential
interventions for modulating aging and longevity.

##### **Chapter 1**
#### **Iron**

**Tanja Grubi´c Kezele**

**Abstract** Iron is an essential component of every living organism. Iron excess and
deficiency are equally detrimental for the cell and thus species longevity. They cause
very large number of health disorders and organ system dysfunctions, especially
development of age related diseases in elderly people. Iron deficiency increases
morbidity and mortality because it causes growth arrest and cell death. Age-related
accumulation of iron increases the potential for free redox-active iron, which can
promote oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage and thus functional alterations
of antioxidant enzymes and further increased oxidative damage to DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids in tissues in elderly people. This further increases the risk for cancer, liver diseases, cardiovascular disorders associated with atherosclerosis, diabetes
mellitus, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, metabolic syndrome, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, numerous symptoms and neurodegenerative disorders which accompany
ageing (Alzheimer’s, early-onset Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, etc.). Experimental animal studies provide new insights in iron manipulation mechanisms (ferritin, frataxin, mitochondrial autophagy) involved in species
longevity and suggest further investigation to elucidate possible application for treatment in human degenerative and age-related diseases.

Iron is an essential component of every living organism. In the human body it exists
in a complex with protein (hemo-protein), as heme compounds (hemoglobin or myoglobin), heme enzymes, or non-heme compounds (flavin-iron enzymes, transferrin T. Grubi´c Kezele ( B )

**Fig. 1.1** Fenton reaction

and ferritin), which are important for cellular processes like oxygen transport, electron transfer and oxidation-reductions, mitochondrial respiration and DNA synthesis
or cell growth (Abbaspour et al. 2014).
Iron can serve as an electron donor and acceptor. Within living organisms, iron
can be found in reduced, ferrous (Fe [2+] ) and oxidized, ferric (Fe [3+] ) state (WaldvogelAbramowski et al. 2014). The same chemical properties that make iron an essential
component in numerous physiological processes can cause cell toxicity if iron is
unshielded. A number of transporters, binding proteins, reductases and ferroxidases
help maintain iron homeostasis to prevent this damage. Excess of free iron catalyzes
the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to the highly reactive hydroxyl radical and
hydroxyl anion, in so cold, Fenton reaction (Fig. 1.1). Hydroxyl radicals are very
dangerous oxygen reactive species (ROS) that cause lipid peroxidation, oxidation of
amino acids with consequent protein–protein cross-links, protein fragmentation and
DNA damage (Galaris and Pantopoulos 2008).
With age, our body cells become more vulnerable to iron. Namely, in the ageing
process, mitochondrial function gradually declines and increases the mutations of
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in all tissue cells (Fig. 1.2) (Druzhyna et al. 2008).
Many studies have documented scavenging of mitochondrial ROS is the most powerful protective treatment against iron overload or homeostasis disruption (Seo et al.
2008; Altamura and Muckenthaler 2009). It is very important being able to preserve
the mitochondrial membrane potential and to safeguard the morphologic integrity
withassociatedmitochondrialenzymessuchasaconitase,adeninenucleotidetranslocase and cytochrome coxidase and prevent degenerative processes which accompany
ageing. It has been shown these enzymes mostly suffer oxidative modification under
oxidative stress during ageing (Ma et al. 2009). Besides ageing process itself, iron
homeostasis disruption also causes decline in mitochondrial function and plays a significant role in various degenerative diseases, possibly including age-related tissue
dysfunction (Killilea et al. 2004).
Mitochondria play an important role in the biosynthesis of iron-containing proteins and in iron homeostasis because the majority of iron-sulphur-clusters (ISCs) are
synthesized within mitochondria and dependent on mitochondrial function (Rouault
and Tong 2005).
Since a number of ISC-containing enzymes have been quite labile when exposed to
oxidative stress (e.g., nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenase),
releaseofFe [2+] ionsfromthedamagedenzymeswillcausefurtheroxidativedamageto
mitochondria through the Fe [2+] -catalyzed Fenton reaction (Chance et al. 1979). This
reaction may be responsible for the decline of many molecular and physiological
functions in ageing tissue cells (Ma et al. 2009). Age-related accumulation of iron
increases the potential for free redox-active iron, which can promote oxidative stress
and mitochondrial damage and thus functional alterations of antioxidant enzymes

and further increased oxidative damage to DNA, RNA, proteins and lipids in tissues
in elderly people.
Lysosomes also play key roles, not only in controlled cell death and necrosis,
then also in age related diseases (e.g. neurodegenerative diseases, atherosclerosis)
(Fig. 1.2). Their main role is recycling damaged proteins and other macromolecules.
With age, the autophagy activity becomes slower, resulting large molecules to accumulate within the cell and damaging it.
Lower autophagy activity has been associated with several age-related diseases
(describedlaterinthischapter).Afterlysosomaldegradationofiron-containingendocytosed molecules, lysosomes can accumulate large amounts of redox-reactive ferrous iron, which may jeopardize lysosomal membranes integrity resulting in their
permeabilization, cellular deficits or apoptosis induction. Beside lysosomal large
influence on lifespan upon lysosome impairment in aged organisms, its dysfunction has a large influence on mitochondrial integrity too (mitochondria-lysosome
relationship) (Carmona-Gutierrez et al. 2016).
Regarding ageing and age related diseases iron could be involved as a central
mechanism in the pathology and toxicology of many disorders. Iron accumulation

in vital organs, even in mild cases, increases the risk for liver diseases, cancer, cardiovascular disorders associated with atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, metabolic syndrome, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, numerous
symptoms and in some cases for premature death (Fig. 1.2).
The signs and symptoms of iron overload are mainly non-specific. Thus, early
diagnosis of iron overload requires consideration of this possibility when patient is
having chronic fatigue, joint pain, impotence, osteoporosis and diabetes (Fleming
and Ponka 2012) (Table 1.1).


-----

1 Iron 5

Iron dyshomeostasis resulting in overload can accelerate neurodegenerative disorders and diseases, which accompany ageing (Alzheimer’s, early-onset Parkinson’s,
Huntington’s, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, etc.) (Fig. 1.2). It is unresolved yet whether
iron accumulation causes these disorders or whether it is a consequence. However,
the common feature of all these diseases is excess of oxidative stress with a ROS

production like main pathogenetic item.
It is recently discussed that health can be improved with antioxidants and iron
chelators that reduce oxidative stress or iron levels and slow down ageing. It is
also known that blood donors exhibit lower rates of many diseases and experience
better than average health, probably through controlling of circulating iron levels
(Mehrabani et al. 2008).
Certain researches documented reduced lifespan in conjunction with increased
levelsofaggregatedandinsolubleproteinsafterhighirondietaryintake,andopposite,
extend lifespan due to certain iron chelator and decreased iron levels (Klang et al.
2014).
Obviously, iron accumulation is an inevitable part of the ageing process and
likely threatens protein homeostasis and longevity. That is important knowledge for
understanding causes of age related diseases.
Like iron overload, an iron deficiency is also detrimental for species longevity.
It increases morbidity and mortality because it causes growth arrest and cell death
(Table 1.1). Proper iron supplementation can keep blood iron levels normal. Because
iron excess and deficiency are equally detrimental for the cell, certain regulatory
mechanisms have evolved to maintain iron homeostasis at both, the cellular and the
systemic level (Hentze et al. 2004).
###### **1.2 Iron Homeostasis Regulation**

There are in general four different types of cell, which play an essential role in the
iron homeostasis, by controlling its content and distribution. Duodenal enterocytes
serve for iron absorption, erythroid precursors for iron utilization, reticuloendothelial
macrophages for iron storage and recycling, and hepatocytes for iron storage and
endocrine regulation (Fleming and Ponka 2012). There is no proper physiological
regulation for iron through excretion in the body, so iron absorption must be highly
regulated. To maintain homeostatic balance it is necessary to absorb only 1–3 mg of
iron per day via duodenal enterocytes regarding equal amount lost from desquamated
cells. Dietary iron can be absorbed as part of a protein complex such as heme-protein
via a specific heme transporters or as its Fe [2+] form. A ferric reductase enzyme on the
enterocytes brush border reduces Fe [3+] to Fe [2+] (McKie et al. 2001; West and Oates
2008). After the iron is reduced at the apical membrane, it is taken into the cell
through the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) (Simpson and McKie 2009).
Once iron is inside the enterocyte, it may leave the enterocyte and enter the body
circulation via the basolateral transporter known as ferroportin or can be bound to
ferritin, an intracellular iron bound protein. This iron will be lost from the body


-----

when the enterocyte desquamate. Iron that enters the circulation from enterocytes is
rapidly bound to transferrin, an iron-binding protein of the blood (Wessling-Resnick
2006). Transferrin delivers iron to most of cells that take up transferrin bound iron
via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Erythroid precursors are the major sites of iron
utilization (Frazer and Anderson 2005). These cells express high levels of transferrin
receptor protein 1 (TfR1), which mediates the entry of transferrin bound iron into
recycling endosomes (Skikne 2008). Reticuloendothelial cells serve as the major iron
repository, regulated by hormone protein hepcidin, and represent the most dynamic
iron compartment.
Reticuloendothelial cells obtain most of their iron from the phagocytosis of senescent erythrocytes (Knutson and Wessling-Resnick 2003). Similar to reticuloendothelial cells, hepatocytes are an important site of iron storage in the form of ferritin
(Takami and Sakaida 2011; Pantopoulos et al. 2012; Nemeth and Ganz 2006).
There are several mayor signals that affect iron absorption but they are not the
signals that regulate iron absorption directly. One signal reflects the need for iron
regarding erythropoietic activity. The hormone erythropoietin stimulates red blood
cell production and stimulates iron absorption indirectly, although evidence exist that
is also involved in direct intestinal absorption (Skikne and Cook 1992; Latunde-Dada
et al. 2006; Srai et al. 2010). Second signal depends upon the amount of iron in body
storesandcirculation,whichstimulatestheironabsorptionintheproximalduodenum
if its level is low. Third signal depends on oxygen saturation in the circulation.
Hepcidin is an important factor stimulated through this signals (Nicolas et al.
2002; Ganz and Nemeth 2012). Although the main producing cells are hepatocytes,
it is also produced in the kidney, central nervous system, lungs, heart and other organs
(adipose tissue), but with negligible effect on systemic iron homeostasis (Bartnikas
2014).Whenironstoresarefull,inordertostopitsfurtherabsorption,hepcidindownregulates the ferroportin-mediated release of iron into the circulation (Nemeth et al.
2004a, b). The consequent iron retention in enterocytes decreases iron absorption
and the iron retention in reticuloendothelial macrophages decreases iron export.
Hepcidin is an acute-phase response protein and its synthesis can be stimulated
in inflammatory status (Cabantchik et al. 2005). This reaction represents an evolutionary adaptation as kind of protection from microorganisms, because hepcidin
decreases the availability of circulating iron to invading microbes. However, constant
inflammation can affect the iron homeostasis and lead to low quality of life regarding
constant relative iron deficiency.
Conversely, inadequate hepcidin expression, due to dysregulation of either the
iron-status signal or the erythroid signal, can lead to disruption of iron homeostasis
in the body in the way of iron overload, and thereby shorten the life duration (Ganz
and Nemeth 2012).
Namely, increased dietary iron absorption and iron released from reticuloendothelial macrophages into the blood, due to decreased hepcidin synthesis, exceeds
the binding capacity of circulating transferrin creating redox-active NTBI (nontransferin bound iron; labile plasma iron) in the circulation (Brissot et al. 2012).
Circulating NTBI cannot be used for heme production or up-regulating hepcidin
synthesis because they require transferrin bound iron.


-----

1 Iron 7

Although cells regulate the intake of transferrin bound iron by the expression of
TfR1, the NTBI can be easily taken up by hepatocytes, cardiomyocytes, pancreatic
islet cells, neurons, etc. The excess uptake of iron as NTBI contributes to increased
oxidant-mediated cellular injury (Sripetchwandee et al. 2014).
###### **1.3 Iron and Age Related Conditions and Diseases**

The degenerative processes in many diseases and toxicological insults converge on
iron dysregulation during ageing. This points the role of iron metabolism and implications for the use of iron chelating substances and/or appropriate antioxidants as
nutritional or therapeutic agents in inhibiting the progression of these mainly degenerative diseases that accompany ageing (Mobarra et al. 2016; Fonseca-Nunes et al.
2014). ***1.3.1 Iron and Cancer***

It has been documented that iron is a risk factor for different types of cancers. Like
said before, excess of body iron associated with tissue iron accumulation can provoke malignant transformation of cells due to higher radical production and oxidative
stress induced damage (Toyokuni 2008). It is possible that hydroxyl radicals arising from Fenton reaction damage the genome. It was showed that the CDKN2A/2B
(p16/p15) tumor suppressor genes were one of the major target genes in oxidative
stress-induced carcinogenesis (Akatsuka et al. 2006). Indeed, iron-mediated oxidative damage appears to attack one of the most fragile sites in the genome that are
susceptible to oxidative stress (Brookes et al. 2008) and interferes with cell signaling
pathways involved in the cancer control (Toyokuni 2011).
Thus, iron-mediated persistent oxidative stress not only creates an environment
for gene deletion but also for gene amplification (Drakesmith and Prentice 2008).
For example, persistent damage to hepatocytes in chronic viral hepatitis ultimately
reduces the production of hepcidin, which promotes the absorption and deposition
of iron, regardless of the iron stores (Fargion et al. 2014). Thus, hepatic iron is
increased significantly in patients with chronic viral hepatitis, which causes higher
risk for developing hepatocellular carcinoma (Iwabuchi et al. 2015).
In addition, it is has been suggested the association between endometriosis and
ovarian cancer (Rezazadeh et al. 2005). Namely, ovarian endometriotic, so called
„chocolate” cysts, are rich in blood or catalytic iron, leading to increased oxidative
DNA damage of the epithelial cells which are surrounding those cysts (Rezazadeh
et al. 2005).
Iron’s carcinogenicity has been documented in many animal experiments. There
are examples of carcinogenicity caused by iron compounds application. These
include skin and soft tissue cancer (sarcoma) induced by injecting iron dextran

(Haddow et al. 1964; Chen et al. 1999), induced esophageal adenocarcinoma in
rats receiving only moderately excessive doses of intraperitoneal iron dextran (Wyllie and Liehr 1998), increased tumor incidence in animals on high iron diet (Jiang
et al. 2008), asbestos-induced mesothelial carcinogenesis (Bergeron et al. 1985),
leukemia cell proliferation greater in iron treated animals than in controls without
iron treatment (Hung et al. 2015), etc.
However, non-clinical studies, which investigated whether iron enhances carcinogenesis, provided only limited evidence relevant for cancer patients, since they were
typically based on high iron doses as well as injection routes and iron formulations,
which are not used in the clinical settings. Furthermore, a recent study reported that
iron reduction by phlebotomy was associated with decreased cancer risks in a general
population. Thus, it is important regularly to monitor serum iron level and to be very
careful with the iron substitution therapy during ageing (Drakesmith and Prentice
2008).
Numerous studies have shown that iron excess plays a significant role in cancer
development but still remains controversial whether iron deficiency does it.
The population-based retrospective study has presented an increased cancer risk
in patients with iron deficiency anemia. Specifically the risks for pancreatic, kidney,
liver and bladder cancers are significantly increased. The increased cancer risk in
patients with iron deficiency anemia is probably caused by altered immune system
because of iron deficiency anemia itself. This includes decreased activity of both
cellular and humoral immunity thereby creating a microenvironment permissive for
carcinogenesis (Park et al. 2015).
Anemia is a frequent in cancer patients as a complication too (Ludwig et al. 2015;
Crawford et al. 2002) and functional iron deficiency is the predominant mechanism
followed by increased hepcidin which suppresses the release of adequate quantities
of iron into the circulation and inhibits intestinal iron absorption.
The most important consequence of iron deficiency is the risk for developing
anemia or the aggravation of already existing anemia and thus impairment of quality
of life (Fig. 1.2) (Ludwig et al. 2013). This usually is accompanied by deterioration
of the performance status and impaired outcome of cancer patients (Gilreath et al.
2012). Iron is an important growth factor for rapidly proliferating cells including
tumor cells (Beguin et al. 2013). Hence, it is important to review the safety for
intravenous high dose iron supplementation. Likewise, no increased risk for tumor
incidence and tumor progression was reported (Aapro et al. 2012).
Currently, active infections and iron intolerance are the main contraindications
and limitations of intravenous iron supplementation (Sullivan 1989).
###### ***1.3.2 Iron and Atherosclerosis***

It is possible that higher iron levels will promote atherosclerosis by generating more
oxidative stress and promoting inflammation. There are several atherogenic steps
that iron is involved. Active ferrous iron is a highly effective promoter of lipid

peroxidation and amplifies the pro-oxidant state of vascular cells. Iron increases
free radical production that contributes to the oxidative modification of Low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) either in the plasma or in the subintimal space where atherosclerotic lesion begins (Lynch and Frei 1993). Increased iron levels and lipid metabolism
are directly linked over activity modulation of several key enzymes responsible for
cholesterol and triglyceride homeostasis (Brunet et al. 1999).
In addition, the important link between iron and cholesterol metabolism is sharing
the same receptor expressed on macrophages (LDL receptor-related protein, (LPR)),
which play a key role in the regulation of iron homeostasis (part of reticuloendothelial cell system) (Hvidberg et al. 2005). Therefore, elevated cholesterol absorption
by subintimal macrophages may also increase the iron intake. This leads to higher
oxidative stress in macrophages and increased foam cells formation. Namely, during atherogenesis, blood monocytes are attracted to the subendothelial space where
occurs the deposition of LDL. Later they differentiate into macrophages, and after
LDL ingestion into foam cells (Vinchi et al. 2014). In animal study, the pharmacological suppression of hepcidin has decreased macrophage iron content, and increased
cholesterol efflux from macrophages. Namely, decreased iron levels lowered the formation of ROS and increased the expression of cholesterol transporters, correlating
with reduced foam cell formation and decreased atherosclerosis (Saeed et al. 2012).
There is evidence that atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, stroke and peripheral arterial disease are neither prominent clinical features nor frequent causes of
death in genetic hemochromatosis. This is explained by inappropriately low hepcidin
(key iron influx-efflux control hormone of reticuloendothelial cells—macrophages)
protein levels resulting in increase of expression of ferroportin that exports iron
from macrophage. So, macrophages from hereditary hemochromatosis patients contain significantly less iron compared to macrophages from healthy people (Niederau
2000; Pietrangelo 2006), thus attenuating the inflammatory response by reducing
macrophage cytokine secretion (Wang et al. 2008). It is also important to remember
that hepcidin levels, a hormone that plays a central role in iron metabolism, increase
by the inflammation associated with atherosclerosis.
Another critical role of redox active iron is in mediating the pro-inflammatory
response in endothelial cells making them activated and dysfunctional (Libby 2002).
Apart from its pro-oxidant properties in the vasculature, excess iron may enhance the
atherogenicity of LDL by stimulating the synthesis of lipoprotein with low antioxidative reserve in the liver. Such lipoproteins may be primed for further oxidation
in the subintima and unrecognized by the otherwise effective liver clearance system
(Murray et al. 1991).
If iron is indeed involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, this may have
implications in those pathologies that require long-term iron treatment (like dialysis
and end-stage renal disease patients). Thus, intravenous iron treatment should be
tightly controlled, iron overload markers monitored (transferrin saturation together
with serum ferritin), and preferred a low-dose therapy rather than a high-dose treat
ment.

Iron depletion therapies may offer, either through phlebotomy or iron chelation
in combination with antioxidants, a protective effect in people with increased risk

for developing age related disease (Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, atherosclerosis, etc.)
(Ritchie et al. 2003; Cario et al. 2007).
###### ***1.3.3 Iron and Cardiovascular Diseases***

The majority of cardiovascular disease diagnosis and deaths occur in the elderly
over age of 65 years (Roger et al. 2012), perhaps due to increased exposure to cardiovascular risk factors, including iron, over longer time. Epidemiological studies
documented that high ferritin levels, a marker used for stored iron, correlated with
risk from coronary heart disease development or myocardial infarction (MI) (Pourmoghaddas et al. 2014).
It is documented that men and postmenopausal women have both, higher body
iron levels and higher rates of atherosclerosis than premenopausal women do. It is
possible, that depletion of iron stores by a regular menstrual blood loss may be kind
of protection (Sullivan 1989).
It is also suggested that iron depletion protects against ischemic disease and argued
that the difference in the incidence of heart disease in men and women may be
caused by differences in their iron stores. Evidence for that are studies which claim
that incidence for the MI is reduced in people who donor their blood (Tuomainen
et al. 1997; Meyers et al. 1997).
As it was said before in the previous chapter part, high iron levels are capable of
stimulating the progression of atherosclerotic lesions through producing ROS and
causing lipid peroxidation of atherogenic plaque. The progression of atherosclerosis,
therefore, increases the risk for ischemic cardiovascular events. Iron overload is
associated with the production of free radicals that can damage tissues directly,
resulting in cardiac toxicity (Gammella et al. 2015). The uptake of iron into the
myocardial cells is controlled by the regulated expression of TfR1 and therefore, iron
overload is observed only when the binding capacity of tranferrin is saturated. Then
is formed non-transferrin bound iron or labile plasma iron (Cabantchik 2014). Iron’s
toxicity within cells arises from its ROS production that cause lipid peroxidation
and organelle damage, which leads to cell death and fibrosis and ultimately impaired
systolic and diastolic function (Gammella et al. 2015).
Iron can play also a relevant role in cardiotoxicity induced by some medications.
That includes doxorubicin (DOX)-dependent cardiotoxicity, which is among the
most effective antitumor medications used in a number of neoplastic diseases. Many
observations indicate that susceptibility to DOX-dependent cardiac damage is bigger
with high blood iron levels. During DOX degradation eventually H 2 O 2 is produced, a
mechanism that potentiates iron mediated ROS production and cardiotoxicity (Gammella et al. 2015).
Oxidative stress, which has a main role in this process results from the imbalance
between oxidative metabolism and antioxidant activity. ROS can be tightly controlled
by antioxidants administration, including nutrient antioxidants, which together with
enzyme antioxidants control the ROS within physiological limits.

The effectiveness of antioxidant supplementation dependents on basal endogenous antioxidants levels like vitamin C, vitamin E and β-carotene (Roger and Go
2013). It might be advisable before starting supplementation with these antioxidants in elderly cardiovascular patients, to measure basal plasma antioxidants levels
because of special precautions, which is required in this population. Namely, when
taken in excess may lead to deleterious consequences (Dotan et al. 2009). Besides
antioxidative strategy, iron chelation therapy has been commonly used to prevent
iron-overload induced organ dysfunction (Cassinerio et al. 2012) but the evidences
for efficacy and potential adverse effects are insufficient and inadequate to recommend it in the routine use for cardiovascular diseases patients (Sultan et al. 2017).
However, contrary to Sullivan’s hypothesis (Sullivan 1989), which says that iron
depletion protects against ischemic heart disease, a significant negative correlation
was identified later in studies, between transferrin saturation and coronary artery
disease or MI, leading to the conclusion that high body transferrin could confer
protection against development of coronary heart disease (De Das et al. 2015). Furthermore, in a study that involved 38,244 men without diagnosed cardiovascular
disease, blood donations were not associated with the lower risks for MI nor fatal
coronary heart disease (Ascherio et al. 2001). However, whether replenishing iron
stores in patients with coronary artery disease is beneficial or not, is not sure with
certainty (von Haehling et al. 2015). Epidemiological study suggest that iron deficiency is frequent in patients with coronary artery disease (Kang et al. 2012), and
furthermore, recently studies indicate that iron deficiency has detrimental effects in
patients with coronary artery and heart failure (von Haehling et al. 2015).
However, iron deficiency is prevalent and persistent in acute coronary syndrome
associated with chronic antiplatelet therapy, anemia and increased inflammatory
state with unknown prognosis (Meroño et al. 2016). Furthermore, the most common detected cause of anemia were nutritional deficiency, chronic kidney disease
and blood loss due to antiplatelet agents. Hence, further research is needed to examine the role of correction of anemia in reducing long-term morbidity and mortality
in these patients (Bhavanadhar et al. 2016).
Iron deficiency anemia may serve as an efficient biomarker of long-term risk and
prognosis for coronary artery disease and acute coronary syndrome, heart failure and
arterial hypertension prognosis.
During iron deficiency, maintenance of adequate tissue oxygenation is achieved
through increase of erythropoietin production, erythrocyte concentrations of 2,3diphosphoglycerate, and systemic arterial dilatation, due to peripheral local tissue
auto-regulation. The last one leads to reduced afterload and increased stroke volume. Beside arterial dilatation, anemia also results in decreased blood viscosity,
which increases venous return to the heart and thus, increases preload. Because of
decreased systemic vascular resistance, a sympathetic nervous system is activated,
which increases myocardial contractility and the heart rate. All this events together
raise cardiac heart output. Over the long time, heart adaptations that initially increase
cardiac output lead to the left ventricular hypertrophy with internal cavity enlargement and with time to irreversible pathology or heart decompensation state (heart
failure or aggravate ischemic heart diseases. The effect of chronic iron deficiency on


-----

large blood vessels is resulting in arterial hypertrophy because of sustained mechanic
pressure from increased cardiac output (Farhan et al. 2016).
Iron deficiency in coronary artery disease potentiates an imbalance between
myocardial oxygen supply and demand, which already exists, by reducing oxygen
capacity and at the same time increased myocardial oxygen consumption through
increased cardiac output. With low oxygen-saturation, due to the iron deficiency
comes to impaired vascular healing among patients with coronary artery disease or
acute coronary syndrome (Solomon et al. 2012).
Taking this all events together, if iron deficiency does not solve, circulus vitiosus
is created that causes the deterioration of coronary artery disease and heart failure
development.
###### ***1.3.4 Iron and Brain Diseases***

Iron has to be maintained in a delicate balance because both, iron overload and iron
deficiency are detrimental to the brain and cause neurodegeneration (Belaidi and
Bush 2016).
In physiological conditions, iron-mediated ROS can positively influence the calcium levels and thus the synaptic plasticity (Muñoz et al. 2011). On the other hand,
an excess of iron, with uncontrolled production of ROS, is detrimental for neuronal
survival. A protective mechanism can be played by astrocytes that can uptake iron,
thereby buffering its concentration in the synaptic environment. This mechanism is
potentiated under astrocytes activation during neurodegenerative processes (Codazzi
et al. 2015).
Iron is entering the brain over crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Iron bound
to transferrin is being absorbed in capillary endothelial cells via transferrin receptor
(Bradbury 1997).
The main cells that supply neurons, astrocytes and microglia with iron are oligodendrocytes and choroids plexus epithelial cells (Espinosa de los Monteros et al.
1990).
All this cells take iron in a form of transferrin bound or non-transferrin bound

(Ke and Qian 2007). Important mediator for iron export from astrocytes, like in
other cells, is multi-copper ferroxidase ceruloplasmin. Ceruloplasmin exhibits a
copper-dependent oxidase activity, which is associated with possible oxidation of
Fe [2+] (ferrous iron) into Fe [3+] . In that way it assists, not only in converting toxic ferrous iron into non-toxic ferric state, then also in transporting iron in association with
transferrin, which can carry only ferric form (Song and Dunaief 2013). Absence or
mutations of this enzyme lead to iron accumulation and neurodegeneration in the
CNS. Accumulation in astrocytes may cause astrocyte cell death and further, neuron
death regarding iron deprivation because of impaired iron export. These changes are
causing characteristic neurologic signs and symptoms, such as cerebellar ataxia, progressive dementia and extrapyramidal signs that can occur in normal ageing process

or in neurodegenerative diseases and aceruloplasminemia (Harris 2003; Jeong and
David 2006).
In iron deficiency, the brain iron content is almost unaffected and the brain is
relatively protected (Beard et al. 2006), but during fetal life when the needs for
embryonic and fetal development are high, the cognitive defects that arise from iron
deficiency could not be corrected postnatally (Kwik-Uribe et al. 2000).
Namely, the overall role of iron in the brain is to participate in processes like neurotransmission and myelination. Iron is a cofactor for a variety of enzymes involved
in maintaining healthy oligodendrocytes and myelin, regarding high rate of oxidative
metabolic activity present in oligodendrocytes, and may be a crucial component of
remyelination in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) (Radlowski
and Johnson 2013).
Furthermore, it is an enzyme cofactor involved in synthesis of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), the precursor of catecholamine neurotransmitters such as
dopamine, adrenaline and noradrenaline (Franco et al. 2015) or in synthesis of serotonin (Pino et al. 2017). Iron is also important in the process of degradation of
monoamine oxidase (MAO), the enzyme responsible of oxidative deamination of
dopamine, adrenaline and noradrenaline (Kumar and Aandersen 2004).
Iron levels increase in brain with ageing but the brain iron dyshomeostasis must
not affect brain functioning (Bartzokis et al. 1997). This increase involves the accumulation in specific brain regions that are preferentially targeted in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). The
increased iron concentrations in certain brain regions could result from the altered
vascularization that is observed during ageing and in neurodegenerative diseases. MS
is also a neurodegenerative disease that can be provoked with increased brain iron
levels (Williams et al. 2012). It is possible that mechanisms in the brain that control
iron are damaged causing these disorders via ROS and oxidative stress (Altamura
and Muckenthaler 2009).
The study on autopsied aged brains documented increase of heme oxygenase1 (HO-1), the heat shock protein involved in regulation of iron metabolism. The
increase of HO-1 might be the result of an increased oxidative stress in older people
(Hirose et al. 2003), but the increase of ferritin in aged brain must be elucidated.
Older individuals (60–90 years) comparing with younger subjects (28–49 years)
have more iron in the microglia and astrocytes in different brain regions (cortex,
cerebellum, hippocampus, basal ganglia and amygdala). Oligodendrocytes contain
the largest amount of iron, ferritin and transferrin, but this content remains constant
during ageing (Connor et al. 1990). Iron accumulation in microglia might stimulate
the activation of these cells in the neuroinflammatory processes that contribute to
AD, PD and MS.

**1.3.4.1** **Iron and Alzheimer’s Disease**

Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia characterized by shortterm memory loss, and a progressive decline in cognitive and motor functions

(Altamura and Muckenthaler 2009). In the brains of patients with AD, iron accumulation occurs without the normal increase in ferritin (Connor et al. 1992) thereby
increasing the risk for oxidative stress (Thompson et al. 2003). Link between iron and
AD was the observation that iron accumulates in the same brain regions where exist
plaques of abnormally folded amyloid-β protein deposition (Connor et al. 1992).
Iron seems to promote both, deposition of amyloid-β protein and oxidative stress,
which is associated with the plaques (Huang et al. 2000; Rottkamp et al. 2001),
although some have argued that, by binding iron, Aβ-protein might protect the surrounding neurons from oxidative stress (Perry et al. 2002).
HFE (high Fe or human hemochromatosis) gene mutations are associated with
increased oxidative stress and severity of AD (Braak et al. 1993; Pulliam et al.
2003).
This fact is supporting the idea that iron underlies the increase in oxidative stress
that promotes neurodegeneration in AD (Moalem et al. 2000). HFE protein encoded
by this gene is a membrane protein that regulates circulating iron uptake by TfR1
and the iron storage via hormone hepcidin. Its mutation is causing the iron overload
and storage disorder hereditary hemochromatosis.
Iron chelators are being considered for the treatment of AD because chelation
has the potential to prevent iron-induced ROS, oxidative stress and aggregation of
α-synuclein and Aβ-protein (Shachar et al. 2004; Dusek et al. 2016)

**1.3.4.2** **Iron and Multiple Sclerosis**

Excess iron can promote inflammatory states of macrophages and microglial cells,
which could be beneficial in combating an infection, but can have also the negative
effect in multiple sclerosis where inflammation is an important pathological component of the disease. In conditions where iron concentrations reach high levels, there
can be enhanced generation of ROS leading to myelin and neuron loss followed by
demyelination and neurodegeneration (Williams et al. 2012). Investigations in animal
models of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, showed worsening of
clinical course in those animals which had an iron accumulation in central nervous
system (brain and spinal cord) ( Curko-Cofek et al. [´] 2016), especially in male rats
indicating sex dependent mechanisms that must be elucidated ( Curko-Cofek et al. [´]
2017).
It is interesting to note that in patients with MS, iron content is elevated in deep
grey matter structures and in the vicinity of lesions, and reduced in the white matter
(Hametner et al. 2013). Furthermore, iron content is low in remyelinated plaques
(Hametner et al. 2013), suggesting that dynamic shuttling of iron continues through
the MS disease process. This reveals that the iron dysregulation associated with MS
is in fact a redistribution of iron between different areas of the brain.

During remyelination, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are recruited to
the MS lesions and differentiated into mature oligodendrocytes which can further remyelinate a damaged axons. Considering the requirement for iron-containing
enzymes in all these processes, iron levels in oligodendrocytes have an important


-----

1 Iron 15

influence on remyelination and neuronal repair. In the situation of reduced iron availability and iron-deficient oligodendrocytes, whether through global iron deficiency
(Schonberg and McTigue 2009) or impaired iron export from astrocytes (Schulz et al.
2012), it leads to reduced OPCs proliferation, oligodendrocyte differentiation and
following remyelination.
Studies examining therapeutic approaches indicate that iron chelation therapy
could benefit MS by regulating the immune response and limiting oxidative damage.
However, experiences from other conditions indicate that iron chelation therapy in
MS can cause adverse side effects that indicate close monitoring of patients during
administration (Weigel et al. 2014).

**1.3.4.3** **Iron and Parkinson’s Disease**

English physician James Parkinson is the first who described Parkinson’s disease. It
is caused by a selective loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the pars compacta of the
substantia nigra (Lozano et al. 1998).
Several researches have documented an increase in total iron concentration in

the substantia nigra in the most severe cases of PD, but no changes were found in
milder cases (Götz et al. 2004). Elevated iron concentrations in the substantia nigra
might result from mutations in genes that are relevant for iron transport and binding.
Another potential source of increased brain iron concentrations is from peripheral
iron influx through a discontinued BBB, precisely via Permeability-glycoprotein (Pgp). It is an efflux pump system in the cell membrane, which might be not working
well in certain brain regions in PD, thereby making the brain accessible to many
foreign substances out of the brain, including serum iron. Iron deposits were found in
microglia, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes located close to neurons, pigmented neurons
in the substantia nigra pars compacta, but also in the putamen and pallidum of patients
with PD. Numbers of ferritin-loaded reactive microglia are often associated with
degenerating and neuromelanin-loaded dopaminergic cells (Jellinger et al. 1990).
Several studies have shown that iron interacts with α-synuclein, a critical target
protein that regulates the supply and adequate release of synaptic vesicles with neurotransmitter dopamine in presynaptic terminals (Uversky et al. 2001). This pathological process induces the formation of neuron intracellular aggregates that disturb
the cytosolic environment and interact with the vesicles, dopamine transporters and
mitochondria. These disturbances might result in activation of cell death cascades.
Neuromelanin, a strong chelator of cytoplasmic iron (Zucca et al. 2017), in a complex
with iron activates microglia in vitro, leading to the release of neurotoxic compounds
such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), nitric oxide (NO) and
neuromelanin itself released by dying neurons. Those factors can further induce
release of neurotoxic microglial factors that can potentially lead to neurodegeneration or PD (Zecca et al. 2004).
Like said before, the ability of the lysosome to participate in autophagy becomes
slower with age, resulting in the increase of non-protein “garbage” within the cells.


-----

16 T. Grubi´c Kezele

Less optimal autophagy has been also associated with several age related diseases,
including PD (Carmona-Gutierrez et al. 2016).
Further, accumulated iron increases protein aggregation via enhanced generation
of ROS and oxidative stress. Chelators of iron could help slow down the development
of the PD. However, certain authors argued about implication of iron deficiency in
pathogenesis of PD (Yien and Paw 2016) because it is yet not established whether iron
chelators are able to remove excess iron without interfering with normal systemic
iron metabolism.
###### ***1.3.5 Iron and Obesity Related Disorders***

Obesity and increased adiposity are also prevalent in the elderly. The bad influence of
iron on glucose metabolism causing risk for diabetes was first recognized in hereditary hemochromatosis, but high levels of dietary iron is also included in causing
that risk. One of the known mechanisms is generating ROS that damage the tissue in
which iron is accumulated (Simcox and McClain 2013). Nevertheless, the observed
oxidative stress in islets of pancreas, and other tissues as well, is not caused only
directly by the ROS generation, then also by affecting trafficking of other metals
important for mitochondrial activity. For example, iron overload inhibits mitochondrial uptake of manganese, resulting in decreased activity of superoxide dismutase 2
(SOD2), enzyme that clears mitochondrial ROS and, as a result, confers protection
against cell death. Experimental data on animals confirm detrimental influence of iron
excess through decreased insulin secretory capacity, decreased glucose-stimulated
insulin secretion, and increased β-cell death (Cooksey et al. 2004). Altogether, pancreas iron accumulation causes β-cell failure and therefore is directly involved in
diabetes pathogenesis.
Iron and increased iron stores are closely associated with increased risk of type 2
diabetes, metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance (Gabrielsen et al. 2012). It was
shown that ferritin blood concentration, the higher is in the individual the lower is
his insulin sensitivity (Jehn et al. 2004; Gabrielsen et al. 2012).
Besides, insulin sensitivity increases as iron stores become reduced in individuals
with high ferritin (Facchini and Saylor 2002; Valenti et al. 2007).
Among many epidemiological studies, that included Europeans, AfricansAmericans, gestational diabetes and prediabetes across sexes, it was found strong
relationship between high serum ferritin, insulin resistance and diabetes (Simcox and
McClain 2013).
It is important to consider that type 2 diabetes is marked by chronic inflammation,
and that ferritin is acute-phase response protein that increases with inflammation.
Whether high iron is caused by diabetes in the first place is confuted in several fields.
C-reactive protein (CRP) nor inflammation did not account the association between
iron and diabetes risk (Padwal et al. 2015), but rather dietary iron overload (Bowers
et al. 2011), particularly dietary heme iron (from meat, fish) (White and Collinson
2013) which is more efficiently absorbed than non-heme iron. Furthermore, the best


-----

evidence that proves those statements offer studies in which iron reduction (like
with phlebotomy and blood donating) increases adiponectin and improves glucose
tolerance in patients with impaired glucose tolerance and very high ferritin levels
(Simcox and McClain 2013; Gabrielsen et al. 2012).
Studies in vitro, on animal models and humans too, provided evidences that
iron plays a direct and causal role in determining insulin-sensitizing adipokine
(adiponectin) levels and diabetes risk (Gabrielsen et al. 2012) with negative correlation between adiponectin and ferritin.
Adiponectin is protein hormone that regulates glucose metabolism and fatty
acid oxidation with concentrations normally increased during caloric restriction.
Adipose tissue, as an endocrine organ, is a major producer of adiponectin among
other adipocytokines involved in the regulation of insulin sensitivity, inflammation,
atherosclerosis, etc. Adiponectin normally shows protective anti-inflammatory, antihyperglycemic, anti-atherogenic activities, considering the fact that obesity relateddiseases are inflammatory states (Padwal et al. 2015). In the experiment with cultured
cells, iron down-regulated adiponectin transcription through FOXO1 (forkhead box
protein O1) transcription factor inhibition (Gabrielsen et al. 2012). Further, experiments on animals showed the loss of iron-export channel ferroportin, resulting in
adipocyte iron loading, and insulin resistance (Gabrielsen et al. 2012). It is also
considering that adipocyte insulin resistance is an early event in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (Wlazlo et al. 2013). Supporting these findings of adipocyte
overload, the contrary evidence showed that increased adipocyte ferroportin expression in hemochromatosis was associated with decreased adipocyte iron, increased
adiponectin,improvedglucosetoleranceandincreasedinsulinsensitivity(Gabrielsen
et al. 2012).
It is obvious that dietary iron and body iron stores are certainly involved in obesity and related disorders (type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance),
through modulating the metabolism with adiponectin in response to iron stores.
That was confirmed with phlebotomies in humans with reversal diabetes effect over
increasedadiponectinreleaseandimprovedglucosetolerance(Gabrielsenetal. 2012;
Nigro et al. 2014).
Iron is consider to contribute obesity in elderly people. Dietary iron intake is
associated with increased appetite via increased serum leptin levels. Dietary iron
overload appears to increase adipocyte iron and decreases leptin mRNA and serum
protein levels in animal experiment (Gao et al. 2015).
Leptin is satiety hormone, so its lower levels with a high-iron diet provide a
mechanism for increased hunger. Human ferritin levels are inversely associated with
serum leptin independently of inflammation and weight, which indicates that levels of
dietary iron play an important role in regulation of appetite and metabolism through
leptin expression (Gao et al. 2015).
The important factors that drive iron accumulation, beside dietary iron intake, is
ageing itself with no proper body losses.
Since elderly people often weight gain, due to the body’s metabolism slowering with
age (Alfonzo-González et al. 2006), adipose tissue expansion and fat accumulation
causes dysregulation of adipokine production that strongly contributes to the onset of


-----

18 T. Grubi´c Kezele

obesity-related diseases (Nigro et al. 2014). In obesity, iron distribution is altered at
the cellular levels, where an increased availability of fatty acids during obesity may
contribute to the observed changes in macrophages polarization and their reduced
capacity to handle iron, which results in adipocyte iron overload (Orr et al. 2014).
In addition, the direct link between iron and obesity are findings in animal research,
which have shown that iron reduction ameliorates adiposity (Tajima et al. 2012).
Furthermore, it is possible that ageing associated obesity is one of possible reasons
of anemia of ageing. Namely, old age is characterized by a chronic inflammation and
decline of the immune response. There are evidences with increased circulating levels
of IL-6 and CRP, among other inflammatory markers (Harris et al. 1999; Krabbe et al.
2004).
It is documented that obesity negatively affects ageing by changing immune system, with reduction of T-cell precursors (Yang et al. 2009), narrowing the immune
repertoire against antigens encountered later in life. In addition, chronic inflammation present in elderly, due to chronic conditions prevalent in older populations
(Fairweather-Tait et al. 2014) is one of the reasons of iron deficiency anemia.
Serum iron is frequently lower, and ferritin levels higher in obese compared with
normal-weight people (Cheng et al. 2012; Tussing-Humphreys et al. 2012), but with
depleted iron stores, despite a higher ferritin levels (see Sect. 1.4). Iron content
showed increased accumulation in adipose tissue from obese patients and negatively
correlated with adiponectin expression, which could contribute to insulin resistance
and development of the metabolic complications in obesity (described above) (PihanLe Bars et al. 2016).
Hepcidin is a pro-inflammatory adipokine released from adipocytes too, and may
play an important role in hypoferremia of inflammation in obese individuals, independent from diabetes type II (Bekri et al. 2006; Gotardo et al. 2013).
As a whole, the available evidence suggests that chronic inflammation of obesity and
ageing may impair iron status through hepcidin and that hepcidin is not only crucial
for iron homeostasis then also for immune response (Dao and Meydani 2013).
###### **1.4 Iron Deficiency**

In iron deficiency, there are low levels of mobilizable iron with compromised supply
to tissues, including bone marrow and, therefore, erythropoiesis. Iron deficiency can
exist with or without anemia but the most functional deficits appear to occur with the
anemia. Even mild to moderate iron deficiency anemia can affect cognitive development, immunity mechanisms, work capacity, learning ability and increase risk for
sepsis during pregnancy, maternal mortality, perinatal mortality and low birth weight
(Abbaspour et al. 2014). Complications associated with anemia in erderly are cardiovascular disease, increased falls and fractures, cognitive impairment, increased
frailty, decreased quality of life and higher risk for morbidity and mortality (Eisenstaedt et al. 2006) (Table 1.1).


-----

1 Iron 19

Iron deficiency anemia is very often present in the elderly people, particularly in
those aged over 80 years. With ageing iron status is impaired with increased moderate
anemia after age of 50 (Eisenstaedt et al. 2006; Lopez-Contreras et al. 2010) but it
is not clearly understood why.
On the other hand, a number of individual or combined factors may cause iron
deficiency. That includes poor diet and secondary nutritional deficiency, reduced efficiency of iron absorption as a result of reduced stomach acid production, occult blood
loss (most frequently gastrointestinal bleeding), medications, chronic inflammation,
chronic kidney disease and other chronic diseases (e.g. chronic infection, chronic
immune activation, malignancy, atrophic gastritis, celiac disease or infection with
Helicobacter pylori) and unexplained anemia (Patel 2008).
Nutritional anemia with deficiencies of iron, folate or vitamin B12 is effectively
treated with certain replacement (Eisenstaedt et al. 2006; Lopez-Contreras et al.
2010). However, some studies have documented that elderly people who consumed
Mediterranean diet (rich in fish, vegetables, fruit, olive oil and dairy products) had
low prevalence of anemia and no measurements of infection/inflammation (Vaquero
et al. 2004).
Iron deficiency anemia caused by occult bleeding requires further investigation
before final treatment, anemia of chronic inflammation or chronic kidney disease
may respond to treatment of the underlying disease and selective treatment with
erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA). However, the treatment of unexplained
anemia is difficult, and there is little evidence that is effective at all (Bross et al.
2010).
Anemia in the malignancy that belongs to anemia of chronic diseases is often functional type, like it was mentioned above in the chapter about iron in cancer patients,
and its treatment increases survival efficiency (Calabrich and Katz 2011).
Diseases associated with bleeding usually include colon cancer, gastric and/or
peptic ulcer, hiatus hernia, colonic vascular ectasia, colonic polyps and Crohn’s
disease (Fairweather-Tait et al. 2014).
Furthermore, elderly people are often taking aspirin for other conditions that
include atherosclerotic cardiovascular changes. Atherosclerosis, a primary cause of
MI is an inflammatory disease. Aspirin use lowers risk for MI, probably through antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects. It has long been known that people who
are taking aspirin have lower serum iron and serum ferritin levels. This effect results
from possible occult blood loss and a cytokine-mediated effect on serum ferritin
in individuals with inflammation, liver diseases, and infection. Aspirin lowering
serum ferritin levels is more marked in those diseased subjects than in healthy ones
(Fleming et al. 2001). Namely, ferritin is an acute-phase response protein, and usually
is increased in inflammatory states or in conditions with damaged hepatocytes. This
is why sometimes in these situations ferritin levels do not correlate with the storage
iron. Therefore, a normal CRP should be used to exclude elevated ferritin caused by
acute-phase reaction (Park et al. 2015).
Hemoglobin (Hb) concentration has been reported to decline with ageing. In one
report, this was calculated to be 0.53–0.1 g/L/year in men and 0.05–0.09 g/L/year
in women between the ages of 70 and 88 years (Nilsson-Ehle et al. 2000; Milman

et al. 2008). The decline appears to increase after the age of 80, particularly in men.
It is probably a result of age related decrease in hormones production, including
growth hormone, testosterone and/or insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), whose
levelspositivelycorrelatewithHbinelderlypeople(DeVitaetal. 2015).Erythrocytes
released from the bone marrow are also less functional and resistant, and partially
damaged with age.
All this together is contributing anemia of ageing (Fairweather-Tait et al. 2014).
Nevertheless, it is possible to differentiate between pure iron deficiency anemia,
anemia of chronic disease, and anemia of chronic disease with co-existing iron deficiency.
###### **1.5 Recommended Iron Intake for Longevity in the Elderly**

About 1 mg of iron is lost each day together with surface cells from skin, mucosa and
gastrointestinal tract. A dietary intake of iron is needed to replace that loss including
stool and urine iron. These physiological losses represent approximately 0.9 mg of
iron for an adult male and 0.8 mg for an adult postmenopausal female (Abbaspour
et al. 2014). Iron requirements for postmenopausal women is almost 2.5 time lower
than in women of reproductive age unlike in men who require the same amount from
20 years till old age (Abbaspour et al. 2014). Most of the countries formulate their
own daily nutrient recommendation or RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance) for
their populations. National Academy of Sciences recommended dietary iron intake
allowance for men (ages 19 and older) and postmenopausal women (ages 51 and
older) at value of about 8 mg/day (Trumbo et al. 2001). Tolerable Upper Intake
Levels (UL), at which no unwanted side effects are present, is 45 mg/day (Institute
of Medicine (US) Panel on Micronutrients 2001) Iron deficiency is treated with about
50–100 mg elemental iron three times a day and is continued another 3–6 months to
build up the body’s iron reserves (Pennisi 2017).
Food sources of iron include meat and meat products, which contain heme iron,
especially red meat, offal and dark poultry meat, oily fish such as tuna and sardines,
cereal products, eggs, dark green vegetables and for vegetarians soybeans, tofu,
lentils, kidney beans, chickpeas and baked beans. Dietary factors that could influence iron absorption as inhibitors are phytates (in wheat and other cereals, seeds,
nuts, beans), polyphenols (in cocoa, berries, beans, nuts, red wine, black and green
tea, coffee), calcium (in milk and milk products), some proteins (phosvitin in eggs,
casein in milk) and tannins (in non-herbal teas) which chelate iron (Zijp et al. 2000).
Reduced gastric acid production (gastrectomy, atrophic gastritis, drugs like antacids,
proton pump inhibitors, H 2 blockers) contributes to low iron transformation from
ferric to ferrous iron which is more easily absorbed. Factors that act as competitors
with iron in intestinal absorption are cobalt, strontium, manganese and zinc which
are sharing the same intestinal absorption pathway as iron (Rossander-Hultén et al.
1991). Facilitators of iron absorption are preventing the formation of insoluble iron
compounds, and reducing the ferric to ferrous iron. They include scorbate, citrate,

some proteins, meat and fish. Iron from meat and fish as heme iron is more easily
absorbed than non-heme iron from vegetables (Teucher et al. 2004).
Health disorders caused by iron deficiency must be corrected through diet or
therapy, but carefully, because of the risk from increased body iron stores, as this
may have detrimental effects for the cells and organs, and therefore, longevity. In
elderly people, finding an adequate supply of iron may be a challenge due to impaired
absorption, often a reduced food intake, and health dietary patterns with more limited
diet.
###### **1.6 Interaction of Iron with Drugs Prescribed in the Elderly**

Iron can interact with certain medications. Some of them can decrease, or less often,
increase iron levels. Iron itself can decrease intestinal absorption and effectiveness
of certain medications when taken together at the same time. For that reason, iron
supplements must be taken for couple of hours before or after taking medications. ***1.6.1 Medications Which Absorption Can Be Decreased*** ***by Iron***

***Levodopa and Methyldopa***
Iron supplements reduce the absorption of levodopa, which is used for PD and restless
leg syndrome treatment, and methyldopa, which is used for high blood pressure.
This is possible through intestinal chelation (Campbell and Hasinoff 1989; Greene
et al. 1990) that reduces the therapy effectiveness of levodopa and methyldopa. The
medications must be taken 2 h before or after taking iron supplements.
***Levothyroxine*** is used to treat hypothyroidism, goiter, and thyroid cancer. The simultaneous ingestion of iron and levothyroxine can result in reducing levothyroxine efficacy in some patients (Campbell et al. 1992). Medication must be taken 2 h before
or after taking iron supplements.

***Antibiotics***

Iron might decrease of antibiotic absorption. Quinolones (ciprofloxacin, enoxacin,
norfloxacin, sparfloxacin, trovafloxacin and grepafloxacin) and tetracyclines (tetracycline, doxycycline and minocycline) possess iron-chelating activity. To avoid this
interaction, the iron must be taken 2 h before or after taking quinolone antibiotics
(Brouwers 1992) and 4 h after taking tetracyclines (Gu and Karthikeyan 2005).
***Bisphosphonates*** are using in treatment of osteoporosis (alendronate, etidronate,
risedronate, tiludronate and others). They inhibit the bone resorption by affecting
osteoblasts. Iron can decrease absorption of these medications creating complexes,
so bisphosphonates are never giving with food or together with iron supplements.


-----

22 T. Grubi´c Kezele

It is necessary to take bisphosphonates at least 2 h before iron or later in the day
(Martin and Grill 2000).
***Penicillamines*** are using for treating Wilson s disease, severe rheumatoid arthritis
and cystinuria. Penicillamine is a chelating agent that reduces copper and cystine
excess and rheumatoid arthritis activity. When taken together with iron supplements,
iron binds penicillamine, decreases its absorption and thus lowers drug efficiency. To
avoid this interaction iron must be taken 2 h before or 2 h after taking penicillamine
(Lyle 1976).
***Captopril*** (angiotensin-converting-enzyme(ACE)inhibitor)isamedicationfortreating high blood pressure. It can bind iron (maybe other ACE inhibitors too) and form
compound that cannot be absorbed, thereby decreasing both medication and iron
supplement in the blood. To avoid this interaction, the iron supplements and ACE
inhibitors must be taken for 2 h apart (Campbell and Hasinoff 1991).
Some studies are suggesting taking iron to soothe and prevent cough, as a side effect
symptom from ACE inhbitors (enalapril, captopril and lisinopril) (Weiss et al. 1994;
Lee et al. 2001).
###### ***1.6.2 Medications that Decrease Iron Absorption***

***Bile Acid Sequestrants*** are blood cholesterol lowering medications **(Cholestyra-**
**mine and Colestipol)** . They are also used to relieve itching caused by biliary obstruction. Taken together with iron supplements, bind inorganic and hemoglobin iron and
inhibit its absorption (Leonard et al. 1979).

***Anti*** **-** ***Ulcer Medications***

For adequate absorption of nutritional non-heme iron, it is important to have normally
produced gastric acid. Taking proton-pump inhibitors (lansoprazole and omeprazole), H 2 blockers (cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine and nizatidine) or antacids
results in a reduced secretion of gastric acid, which further reduces iron absorption.
This fact is more important for patients who are already having iron deficiency and
therefore suboptimal responses to iron supplementation (Ajmera et al. 2012). ***1.6.3 Medication that Increase Blood Iron Levels***

***Oral Contraceptives*** may increase blood iron levels, thereby decreasing the need for
extra iron (Gellert and Hahn 2017).

###### **1.7 Iron and Species Lifespan Studies**

**Drosophila**
Runko and co-workers showed in their study that overexpression of *Drosophila*
protein frataxin in the mitochondria enhances the lifespan by increase of antioxidant
capability and resistance to oxidative stress damage. Frataxin is a chaperon-like
mitochondrial protein involved in assembly of ISC proteins and counteracts tissue
iron accumulation. Its reduction leads to deficit of ISC enzymes and energy, and
increase in mitochondrial iron level. Respiratory chain dysfunction induced by iron
and ROS further leads to an oxidative stress damage, neurodegeneration (Friedreich’s
ataxia in humans) and diminished lifespan.
ResultsfromRunkoandco-workerssuggestthat *Drosophila* frataxinmayfunction
to protect the mitochondria from oxidative stresses and cellular damage likely acting
on the control of iron metabolism (Runko et al. 2008).
Rich in polyphenolic compounds, green tea has been shown to increase the lifespan in various animal models, including *Drosophila.* Lopez and co-workers found
that green tea increased lifespan of male flies but with negative impact on fertility.
Interesting thing is that green tea protected male flies against iron toxicity. Findings
suggest that green tea extends the lifespan of male flies by inhibiting reproductive
potential, possibly by limiting iron uptake (Lopez et al. 2014).
High in polyphenolic content, green tea has been shown to reduce oxidative stress
in part by its ability to bind free iron and in part by modulating iron regulators, specifically, mitoferrin (mitochondrial iron transporter) and reduction of mitochondrial iron
(Lopez et al. 2016).

**Nematodes**

*Caenorhabditis elegans* ( *C. elegans* ) is widely used in studies of metal toxicity and
metal homeostasis. Klang and co-workers have investigated the role of metallostasis
in longevity of *C. elegans.* Their investigation included iron and other metals as well.
The data showed increased accumulated levels of iron with age and that dietary supplementation with 15 mM ferric ammonium citrate reduces *C. elegans* lifespan in
conjunction with increased levels of insoluble proteins. Proteomic analysis revealed
widespread effects of supplemental dietary iron in multiple organelles and tissues.
Furthermore, pharmacological interventions (iron chelator) to block iron accumulation attenuated proteotoxicity and extended lifespan of *C. elegans* . Taken together,
these results suggest that iron accumulation with ageing contributes to age-related
protein aggregation and negatively affects longevity (Klang et al. 2014).
Valentini and collaborators investigated impact of different free iron levels on
oxidativestressresistance,ageingandlifespandurationinC. *elegans* .Theyfoundthat
15 mM and greater of supplemental iron increased protein oxidation and shortened
the lifespan of *C. elegans* and that moderate supplemental iron level (9 mM) increased
oxidative stress without reducing the lifespan. Further, to test if the lowering free iron
levels increases the lifespan duration in *C. elegans*, the authors used iron chelator
and forced over-expression of ftn-1 (ferritin). However, they found reduced protein
oxidation but without increased lifespan.


-----

24 T. Grubi´c Kezele

Moreover, the data showed increased expression of ftn-1 in long-lived daf-2
insulin/IGF-1 receptor mutants. Further, deletion of ftn-1 decreased resistance to
oxidative stress, but enhanced daf-2 mutant longevity suggesting an effect of ferritin on signaling pathways that control ageing. This effect of ftn-1 may affect either
insulin/IGF-1 signaling or some other pathway upstream or in parallel to insulin/IGF1.

Collectively, investigators results showed that high levels of iron could increase
oxidativestressdamageandreducelifespan,butoverallsuggestthatironlevelswithin
the normal physiological range do not promote ageing in *C. elegans* (Valentini et al.
2012).
In a Schiavi work group was investigated beneficial adaptive response to mild
mitochondrial stress upon partial frataxin depletion in *C. elegans* . They showed for
the first time that this conserved response of mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) to
frataxin silencing is activated in response to mitochondrial stress in a pdr-1/Parkin-,
pink-1/Pink-, and dct-1/Bnip3-dependent manner. The important finding is that this
mitophagy induction extended the lifespan of C. *elegans* .
Mitochondrial autophagy is a form of autophagy, which is activated to recycle
unhealthy mitochondria and the question of this investigating group was, whether
mitophagy could play a specific role in mitochondrial stress control of longevity.
Like said before in a part of *Drodophila* studies, the frataxin is a mitochondrial
protein, which regulates the biogenesis of ISC proteins and, similar to other proteins that regulate mitochondrial respiration, frataxin deficiency leads to development of Friedreich’s ataxia in humans and to developmental arrest in the nematode
*C. elegans* . Frataxin suppression affects intracellular levels of adenosine triphosphate
(ATP), ROS and cytosolic iron, which can initiate a hypoxia-like signaling and an
iron starvation response, which further induce mitophagy and causally involve lifespan extension. The authors also identified non-overlapping hif-1 upstream (HIF-1prolyl-hydroxylase) and downstream (globins) regulatory genes mediating lifespan
extension upon frataxin and iron depletion. This data suggest that mitophagy could
represent the potential target for the treatment of human mitochondria-associated
and age-related disorders (Schiavi et al. 2015).

**Rodents**

Andziak and Buffenstein in their study refuted theory that levels of accrued oxidative
damage increase with age. They compared lipid peroxidation profile and non-heme
iron liver levels in long living naked mole-rats and shorter-living CB6F1 hybrid
mice. The data revealed that concentrations of markers of lipid peroxidation, as well
as iron, were at least twofold greater in naked mole rats than in mice. This refutes
the hypothesis that prolonged naked mole-rat longevity is due to superior protection
against oxidative stress or reduced level of tissue iron. In naked mole-rats, urinary
isoprostane excretion declined by half with age, despite increases in tissue iron.
Moreover, contrary to the predictions of the oxidative stress theory, lipid damage
levels did not change with age in mole-rats. These findings suggest that age-related
changes are species specific, independent of oxidative stress parameters (Andziak
and Buffenstein 2006).

Pabis and collaborators examined involvement of iron metabolism in extended

lifespan of long-lived rodent model. They quantified heme, tissue non-heme iron and
several proteins involved in iron utilization in three different mouse models (Ames
dwarfs, calorie restricted and rapamycin fed mice that extends lifespan in rodents). In
addition, they studied the effects of rapamycin on 3T3 fibroblasts and measured the
labile iron pool (free iron), sensitivity to iron induced cytotoxicity and expression of
antioxidant genes. In long-lived mouse models, they found that NHI content tended
to decrease but the changes were tissue specific and not consistent across models.
Comparing changes in iron with those in cadmium, they found clear differences
ruling out a generalized decrease in metal content. Preliminary data reveal that heme
oxygenase was elevated in two mouse models. These findings are consistent with the
idea that reduced total or labile iron plays a role in health and ageing (Pabis et al.
2017).
###### **1.8 Conclusion**

Ironisanimportantcomponentoflivingorganism,whichallowsnormalcellandbody
functioning, and provides health. Important fact is that, its level must be carefully
regulated, both at the systemic and at the cellular level, because excess might be
detrimental for health and thus longevity. In that situation iron is a major catalyst of
reactive hydroxyl radicals, that compromise cell integrity and thereby integrity of all
body organs. That further accelerates ageing processes and provokes development
of many health disorders and organ system dysfunctions, which together shorten
species lifespan. **References**

**Miguel Arredondo, Mauricio González and Mauricio Latorre**

**Abstract** Copper is an essential micronutrient for life. It is require by a wide range
of species, from bacteria to yeast, plants and mammals including humans. To prevent
the consequences of the deficit or excess of copper, living organisms have developed
cellular mechanisms that regulatetheuptake, efflux, storageanduseof themetal. Several diseases are consequences of defects in such biological systems. Copper intake
is reduce in elderly people, in some cases leading to two mayor problems for the
human health. As co-factor of several antioxidant enzymes, reduction in the concentration of this metal directly affect the protective activity of these proteins, decreasing
the capacity of the organism to counteract the oxidative stress damage, affecting the
inflammatory/immune response and affecting the functioning of the central nervous
system functioning through its participation as neurotransmitter and the ubiquitin
proteasome system. Chronic copper toxicity is rare and primarily affects the liver.
Wilson’s disease and Indian childhood cirrhosis are examples of severe chronic liver
disease that results from the genetic predisposition to the hepatic accumulation of
copper. By the other hand, Alzheimer and Parkinson disease are examples of neurodegenerative disorder that may course with an alteration in copper metabolism.

Finally, it had been developed new technology in order to study the role of copper on
the ageing, highlighting advances in the field of system biology and transcriptomic.

###### **2.1 Introduction**

Transition metals such as copper are essential to life because of their catalytic and
structural roles they play in proteins, and other biomolecules (Uauy et al. 1998).
Although essential metals are normally present in trace amounts in the cell, their
levels can change following environmental or nutritional variations, variables that
also effected during the cycle of life. Metal overload can be toxic to the cell, causing a range of effects and leading to cell death when concentrations are extremely
high (Dameron and Harrison 1998). In contrast, copper deficiency is usually the
consequence of decreased copper stores at birth, inadequate dietary copper intake,
poor absorption; increased requirements induced by rapid growth, or increased copper losses. To avoid copper deficiency and metal-induced toxicity, most organisms
have developed several molecular and cellular mechanisms of protection. Three general mechanisms, which typically work in combination for effective homeostasis at
organism levels, include reduction of metal uptake, enhanced metal export, and metal
sequestration mechanisms. **2.2 Intestinal and Hepatic Tissues Determine Whole-Body** **Copper Distribution**

Several reviews on copper metabolism have described whole-body copper
metabolism (Cartwright and Wintrobe 1964; Sass-Kortsak 1965; Linder 1991; Turnlund 1998; Uauy et al. 1998). Figure 2.1 shows the hypothetical distribution of copper
in a healthy adult including the molecular components associated with intestinal and
hepatic copper metabolism (Gulec and Collins 2014; Lutsenko et al. 2007; González
et al. 2008; Lutsenko 2016). Because extracellular copper is found predominantly
as Cu [2], Steap proteins may be responsible for reduction of Cu [2] to Cu [1] before it
is transported across the plasma membrane via the high-affinity copper transporter
hCTR1, which is specific for Cu [1] (González et al. 2008). In addition, Cu [1] is transport
directly into the cell by the divalent metal transporter DMT1. Once inside the enterocyte, mainly in the small intestine (Fig. 2.1), copper is deliver to various cell targets
with the help of copper chaperones: Atx1p transfers copper to ATP7A located in the
trans-Golgi network; CCS to Cu/Zn super oxidase dismutase (SOD1); and COX17

**Fig. 2.1 Schematic representation of Cu distribution in the organism: from the absorption of**
**the metal to its excretion** . The processes of transport and absorption of copper have to supply an
adequate amount of systemic copper to fulfill the requirement of different cupro-enzymes for this
trace metal, at the same time, intestinal mechanisms must exist to prevent an excess of copper in
the organism. Hepatic tissue removes copper from the circulation by rapidly trapping this metal in
chelating copper proteins that transfer copper to cupro-enzymes or ceruloplasmin. Copper returns
to the extra-hepatic circulation mainly bound to ceruloplasmin, while copper excess is excreted into
bile. Abbreviations: Cu: copper; hCTR1: human copper transport protein 1; DMT1: divalent metal
transporter 1; ATP7A: copper transporting alpha polypeptide; Cp: ceruloplasmin; His: histidine;
CCS: copper chaperone for Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase; SOD: superoxide dismutase; ATP7B:
copper transporting beta polypeptide; GSH: reduced glutathione; CCO: cytochrome c oxidase;
OAT: organic anion transporter

through SCO1/2 to cytochrome c oxidase (COX). After that, Cu is transferred from
the intestinal mucosa to the interstitial fluid and blood plasma where it is mainly
complexes with albumin, amino acids (histidine, threonine, cysteine) or peptides
containing these amino acids, passing into the portal circulation (Weiss and Linder
1985; Neumann and Sass-Kortsak 1967; Linder 1991).
In a second phase, the liver tissue removes the Cu from the circulation, via specific transporters such as hCTR1 and DMT1. In the cytoplasm, the Cu is transfer
to the Golgi via ATP7B, where is incorporated to the Ceruloplasmin (the mayor
reservoir of copper in blood), for export to extra-hepatic tissues via the systemic circulation or it can be used by cell machinery to be incorporated into newly synthesized
cupro-proteins. The requirement of copper in enzyme activity, both as a cofactor and
allosteric component of several cupro-enzymes, reveals that this ion is important
for appropriate functional structure and catalytic activity of cupro-enzymes such as
lysyl oxidase, tyrosinase, SOD1 and COX (Uauy et al. 1998). The excess of copper
is bound to glutathione (GSH) and metallothionein (MT) or translocated from the


-----

Golgi to a vesicular transport system and secreted into the biliary canaliculi (Dijkstra
et al. 1996; Linder and Hazegh-Azam 1996). The average daily intake of copper in
the US is about 1 mg Cu with the primary source being the diet. The bioavailability
of copper from the diet is about 65–70% depending on a variety of factors including
chemical form, interaction with other metals, and dietary components. The biological
half-life of copper from the diet is 13–33 days with biliary excretion being the major
route of elimination. Therefore, copper homeostasis is carry out by modifications in
copper absorption and biliary copper excretion. The urinary, excretion of copper, is
negligible in normal healthy man, being 0.1–0.3 mg/day in adults on normal dietary
intakes (Buckley 1996) (Fig. 2.1).
Two genetic diseases involved in Cu transport have been recognized, Menkes
Syndrome and Wilson’s disease, by mutations in ATP7A and ATP7B transporter,
respectively. ATP7A transporter is expressed in all tissue examined (except in liver),
mutations in ATP7A in both humans (Menkes’s disease) and mice (Mottled Mouse)
lead to reduced intestinal basolateral export of copper and subsequent systemic copper deficiency (Mercer et al. 1999). Menkes syndrome is a disease linked to the X
chromosome, which produces Cu deficiency generating progressive mental deterioration, hypothermia, connective tissue abnormalities, which eventually lead to death
at approximately three years of age (Mercer 1998; La Fontaine and Mercer 2007).
Interestingly, immuno-fluorescence studies using an anti-Menkes antibody suggest
that ATP7A protein may concentrate copper in vesicles, which then proceed to the
lysosomal pathway or to the plasma membrane for copper export, while the ATP7A
itself is recycles to the trans-Golgi network (Yamaguchi et al. 1996). At the same
time, Petris et al. (1996), showed that elevated copper culture conditions induced a
rapid trafficking of ATP7A protein from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. Considering these data, the authors suggested the existence of a system of regulated
protein trafficking which ultimately leads to the efflux of an essential yet potentially
toxic ligand. In this model, the ligand (copper) itself appears to stimulate directly and
specifically the trafficking of its own transporter. The implications derived from these
reports, strongly support the transporter-mediated copper model shown in Fig. 2.1.
Moreover, the relationship between changes in the distribution pattern of ATP7A
protein and extracellular copper fluctuation are in agreement with the hypothetical
alternative described in Fig. 2.1.
The major phenotypic manifestations of Wilson disease, such as liver disease and
neurological abnormalities, indicate that the ATP7B protein is mainly express in the
liver and the brain. Similarly to Menkes disease, mutations in the gene encoding
the ATP7B also result in a severe metabolic disorder, affecting two aspects of hepatic copper metabolism i.e. ceruloplasmin formation and biliary copper excretion.
Biochemical and immuno-histochemical studies have mainly localized the Wilson
protein to the trans-Golgi reticulum and late endosomes (Harris and Gitlin 1996).
These results are consistent with the role of Wilson ATPase in transferring copper
from the cytoplasm into the secretory pathway, where it becomes available for incorporation into ceruloplasmin. In addition, ATP7B localized at the canalicular domain
of the hepatocytes plasma membrane (Dijkstra et al. 1996) suggesting that it may
be involved in the direct transfer of copper across this membrane. Thus, the ATPase


-----

may represent an alternative pathway of biliary copper excretion, that works in concert with lysosomal exocytosis and GSH mediated excretion (Fig. 2.1). Therefore, a
defect in ATP7B function induces a decrease of biliary copper excretion along with
an increase in the hepatic content of the metal (Bartee and Lutsenko 2007) which
produces neurological, psychiatric, renal, hematological and endocrine disorders
(Bingham et al. 1998).
###### **2.3 Recommended Dietary Intake of Copper**

Studies using stable isotope such as [65] Cu, allowed estimate that the efficiency of copper absorption in humans ranges between 12 and 60% depending on copper intake,
presence of dietary factors that may promote or inhibit its absorption and the copper
status of the individual (Turnlund et al. 1989; revised in De Romaña et al. 2011). The
total amount of copper that is retained increases with increasing intakes, reaching
a plateau of approximately 1 mg/d with copper intakes of approximately 7–8 mg/d
(Turnlund et al. 1989). The range of acceptable intake to prevent copper deficiency
and toxicity should be based on the protection of healthy populations and should not
be expected to meet requirements or prevent excess of individuals with special susceptibility. The National Academy of Sciences of USA/National Research Council
(NAS/NRC) established the category of Estimated Safe and Adequate Intakes for
essential nutrients when there is insufficient information to determine recommended
dietary allowances (NAS 1989). Since copper requirements are not well established
on a quantitative basis, this mineral is included in this category. The USA NAS/NRC
has recommended that infants from 0 to 6 months of age should receive a daily
intake of 0.4–0.6 mg of copper, increasing progressively up to 2 mg in children up
to 10 years of age. For adolescents and adults this range is 1.5–2.5 and 1.5–3 mg
respectively. World health organization has suggested a recommended daily intake of
copper of 80 μg/kg for infant and young children and of 40 μg/kg and 30 μg/kg for
older children and adult males, respectively (WHO 1973; WHO/FAO/IAEA 1996).
Humans can adapt to excessive copper exposure from food, water, or supplements
by decreasing the absorbed fraction as exposure increases (Uauy et al. 1998; Turlund
et al. 1989). Risk of copper deficit or excess in apparently healthy human populations can be hypothesized under relatively rare conditions of exposure (Uauy et al.
2008; De Romaña et al. 2011). For this reason, identifying biomarkers to detect early
effects of nutrient deficiency and excess has become a pressing challenge in modern nutrition. Until now, numerous efforts have been done to define new molecular
markers by measuring activities in blood of copper-related enzymes, but they have
failed (Suazo et al. 2008). Of the many proteins assessed as potential markers of
copper status the chaperone of SOD1 (CCS) has yielded promising results, however
data on its performance under different conditions are needed to confirm its use as an
indicator of copper status (Olivares et al. 2008; Araya et al. 2014; Arredondo et al.
2014).

###### **2.4 Essentiality, Deficiency, and Intake Related to Aging**

The USDA recommends a consumption of 900 μg/day in adults. In general, copper
deficiency can produce severe health problems, which include arthritis, osteoporosis,
anemia, low body temperature, joint pain, skin inflammation and sores, among others.
While, several reports indicate that ageing does not modify significantly copper
homeostasis, where the regular dietary copper intake of elderly people do not required
an extra supplementation of copper to maintain health. In some cases, the inadequate
intake of this metal can produce several damage, leading principally in three mayor
problems related to oxidative stress protection, inflammatory/immune response and
the Central Nervous System functioning (Fig. 2.2).

###### ***2.4.1 Copper Deficiency and Oxidative Stress Protection*** ***During Ageing***

Trace elements intake (including copper) is reduce in elderly people, this lead to a
decrement in the capacity of the organism to counteract oxidative stress damage. As
mentioned, copper participates as co-factor of several antioxidant enzymes such as
superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and catalase. In contrast to the toxic effect induced
by the copper overload, reduction in the concentration of this metal directly affects
over the activity of these enzymes, decreasing the capacity of the organism to reduce
oxidative damage or enhance repair capacity (Mocchegiani et al. 2014).
In order to study if an increase in copper intake can generate a protective effect
against oxidative stress damage, Kirchman and Botta (2007), generates a forced
respiration model in yeast emulating the cellular aging process. The results indicated that supplementation of copper significantly extends the life span of the yeast.
In addition, mutants for the genes *sod1* and *sod2* supplemented with copper also
increase its viability, strongly suggesting that the addition of this metal may reduce
the oxidative damage under the aging process.
Copper deficiency also has been linked to the appearance of osteoporosis. The
lysyl oxidase (LOX) protein, also known as protein-lysine 6-oxidase, is a copperdependent enzyme, which catalyzes the formation of aldehydes from lysine residues
in collagen and elastin precursors. The reduction of its activity generated by copper
intake problems leads to bone mass loss, called osteopenia of copper deficiency.
The supplementation of copper improve the outcome of femoral neck fracture in
old patients and increase the mineral density in bones in postmenopausal women
(Saltman and Strause 1993; Delmi et al. 1990), strongly suggesting the importance
of a correct dietary intake of this metal in elderly people. Moreover, patients with
severe rheumatoid arthritis showed and important condition of copper deficiency,
accomplished by a typically ingest too much fat and not enough fiber, zinc and
magnesium (Kremer and Bigaouette 1996).
One of the mayor health problems in older population is the aging macular degeneration, leading cause of blindness in several countries. By the year 2020, it is predicted in United States that nearly three million people will suffer this disease (Friedman et al. 2004). The supplementation of several micronutrients (including 2 mg of
copper) in 3640 participants between 55 and 80 years carrying a varying severity of
aging macular degeneration, significantly reduce the progression of the disease in a
25% (Chew 2013). Another common eye pathology in elderly people is the retinal
pigment epithelium (RPE), an ocular degeneration produced by the pigmentation of
the cell layer just outside the neuro-sensory retina that nourishes retinal visual cells.
The ATP7 copper protein migrates toward the apical or basal retinal epithelium,
facilitating the flux of copper between the blood-brain barrier and the retina. Loss
of local retinal activity of this protein in Wilson and Menkes condition contribute to
the retinal degeneration (Krajacic et al. 2006).

###### ***2.4.2 Copper Deficiency and Inflammatory/Immune*** ***Response During Ageing***

The second important alteration is the incorrect inflammatory/immune response
occurred by problems in the absorption or dietary intake of copper. Several studies have been showed the role of copper in the development and maintenance of the
immune system (Percival 1998). Conventionally, the immune system is divided in
acquired and innate systems. In general, copper deficiency reduced the effectiveness
of the acquired response.
Lukasewycz and Prohaska (1990), showed that the production of antibodies by
spleen cells is reduced in mice fed with a low copper diet, presenting a reduction
in the proliferation in splenocytes cells. In this study also, the authors observed that
interleukin 1 and 2 are significantly greater and reduced respectively in the copper
deficient mice, strongly supporting the implication of a correct copper supplementation on the immune response. In terms of the innate system, copper deficiency affects
the functioning of neutrophils and macrophages. Neutropenia is a blood abnormality characterized by a low concentration of neutrophils, a clinical sign of copper
deficiency. It has been postulated, that during copper deficiency scenario, exist a
maturation arrest of granulocytes, increasing the number of promyelocytes and a
reduction in the number of metamyelocytes. A second mechanism includes an early
death of progenitor cells in the marrow, reducing the life span of neutrophils. During
the phagocytosis process, macrophages produce reduced superoxide anions in order
to kill of microbes. The candidacidal activity of macrophages in rats fed with a low
levels of copper, are significantly reduced in relation to the adequate diet (Babu and
Failla 1990).
In humans, copper-deficient marasmic children supplemented with copper significantly improve theirs phagocytic index (Heresi et al. 1985). Low copper diet in
young men induces a reduction in the proliferation of mononuclear cells, including a decrease in the neutrophils amount, directly reflecting the amount of copper
supplemented. Different mechanism has been proposed about the relation between
copper and macrophages activation. In the site of inflammation, there is a local
accumulation of copper and macrophages. The cytokines IFN-γ (interferon gamma)
and TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor alpha) promotes the accumulation of the metal in
phagosomes, following by the activation of CTR1 transporter, which contribute to the
killing capacity of the macrophages related to the reduced superoxide anions (White
et al. 2009). In addition, this rise in copper concentration is due to an elevation of the
ceruloplasmin in serum, protein able to promote an anti-inflammatory activity during
the immune response. On contrary, classic studies indicates that copper deficiency
induce an inflammation in humans, probably linked to the reduction of ceruloplasmin
and cupro-enzyme activities (Giampaolo et al. 1982; Sorenson 1988). In elder population, aged monocytes and macrophages have a reduced phagocyte capacity, this
functional senescence diminished the immune response against pathogens, where
the reduced intake of copper in elderly people may contributes to this phenomenon.

One of the main immune barrier is the skin. This organ contains elements of the
innate and adaptive immune systems. As mentioned, the lysyl oxidase is a cuproenzyme crucial in the metabolism of collagen. Alterations in this protein leads to
faulty of collagen in the body, producing wrinkles, sagging, connective tissue abnormalities and loose skin. At the same way, a decrease in the activity of the superoxide
dismutase enzyme by copper deficiency conduce to skin premature aging by an
accumulation of oxidative stress molecules. A second risk factor induced by copper deficiency in skin aging is the glycation of skin proteins. The hyperglycemia
produced by copper deficiency leads to the glycosylation of several proteins and
peroxidation. Saari et al. (1995), demonstrate that food restriction in rats reduced not
only reduces the peroxidation and glycation, also reduces the symptoms of copper
deficiency.
Alossinthepigmentationofhair(greycolor)isclassicalphenotypesinoldpeople.
Several studies connect the deficiency of copper with achromotrichia (absence or
loss of pigmentation in the hair). Calf feed with low concentration of copper showed
after the treatment several skin problems, including loss in hair pigmentation and
cytochrome oxidase activity reduction (Suttle and Angus 1976). A second study
showed that low amount of copper led to alternate black and white bands in black
sheep, affecting also the shape of the wool (less curly). In addition, grey hair also
presents a lower concentration of copper, demonstrating a link between the metal
deficiency and hair properties (Adams and Murray 1974).
Finally, there are several evidences declaring the effect of hormones over the
copper levels (Malavolta et al. 2015). The expression of ceruloplasmin is significantly
reduced after insulin treatment in rat hepatoma cells, a similar effects when copper
(Cu [+2] ) is added into the media (Leyendecker et al. 2011). In addition, copper increase
in plasma may lead to oxidative stress and tissue damage. These elevated copper
levels could stimulate the formation of advanced glycosylated end products, linked
to secondary complications. These results suggest that ceruloplasmin probably play
a role in the pathogenesis of chronic disease complications such as diabetes mellitus,
one of the highest prevalent metabolic conditions in ageing societies associated with
high levels of obesity.
###### ***2.4.3 Copper and Central Nervous System***

Two mayor role have been assigned to copper on central nervous system functioning.
Copper concentration varies depending of the brain region. Bioavailable copper can
be found in cerebrospinal (70 μM), cerebrospinal (1 μM) fluids, and principally
concentrated in synaptosomes and synaptic vesicles (Stuerenburg 2000). The capacity of copper to form different complex with neurotransmitters directly affects the
synaptic function of the neurons. Koefoed-Johnsen and Ussing (1958) converts the
structure of frog skin membrane by the addition of copper, suggesting that this metal
can modulates the permeability if plasma membrane at the presynaptic or postsynaptic levels. In this line, the stimulation of rat brain cortical synaptosomes by 50 mM

44 M. Arredondo et al.

of KCl induce the release of copper from the cells, same effect occurred during the
activation of NMDA receptors in primary hippocampal cultures (Kardos et al. 1989;
Schlief et al. 2005).
Copper also modulates different neurons of the central nervous system in a similar
way, principally blocking the neurotransmission of GABAergic and AMPAergic in
olfactory bulb neurons, cortical neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells (Opazo et al.
2014). Recently, has been demonstrated that copper also acts as an activator of the
synaptic function. At the beginning, primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons
treated with 10 μM of copper block its AMPAergic activity; however, after three
hours of exposure copper promotes and increase the neurotransmission in these cells
(Peters et al. 2011). This biphasic effect also is correlated to neurophysiology and
neuropathology implications. Primary hippocampal neurons treated by short terms
with copper show a significant increase in amplitude, frequency and time constant
synaptic events, supporting the role of copper as a neurotransmission in the central

nervous system.
A second role for copper is its participation in the Ubiquitin proteasome system.
The main function of this process is to degrade damage or unfolding proteins into
small peptides. The ubiquitin protein is the small substrate added to the proteins as
a signal for their degradation via proteasome. Has been demonstrated by different
in vitro approaches, that ubiquitin binds copper atoms (Cu [2] ) through the histidine68 residue locate in the surface of the protein and forming a metal-protein complex.
Moreover, the addition of copper chelators inhibits the proteasome functioning by
unknown mechanism (Ding and Lind 2009).
Even though, there is not concluded data correlating the copper deficiency with
neurological disorders occurred during the aging process, it is plausible to hypostatize
that copper depletion in cupro-proteins affect the correct functioning of the central
nervous system. Beside its participation in neurotransmission and protein degradation, copper also play a crucial role as a co-factor in mitochondrial ATP production.
The cytochrome c oxidase (COX), a mitochondrial cupro-enzyme, is essential for
oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic respiration. Thus, malfunction of this protein
affects the activity, signaling and survival of neuron cells, being a crucial protein in
etiology, progression and prevalence of numerous human neurodegenerative diseases
(Arnold 2012).
In addition, copper also has been linked to a variety of cardiovascular deficits,
including anemia, high blood pressure, enhancement of inflammation, reduced blood
clotting, and possibly arteriosclerosis, among others. Mutations in cytochrome c
oxidase can be found in patients with hypertrophic cardio-myopathy. Copper supplementation in mice model of ascending aortic constriction can normalize gene
expression related to contractility and inflammation (Zheng et al. 2015). The activity of the cytochrome c oxidase and the oxidative stress generated by mitochondria
are similar in copper deficiency and aging, opening the possibility to use copper
deficiency as a short-term model for studying the potential roles of mitochondria in
cardiac aging (Johnson and Newman 2003). All these data strongly support the idea
that copper supplementation appears to be a simple and manageable approach to

develop new clinical implantation in order to counteract the deficiency of this metal
in elderly people (Table 2.1).
###### **2.5 Copper and Species Longevity** ***2.5.1 Yeasts***

ThebuddingyeastSaccharomycescerevisiaehasbeenextensivelyusedasamodelfor
cellular aging. Using glycerol as carbon source, yeast generates energy by the same
respiratory metabolic pathways as mammalian cells. Under this condition Kirchman
and Botta (2007) showed that copper supplementation was associated with life span
extension, possibly through the upregulation of oxygen-radical defense mechanisms.
In this context, the authors show that copper supplementation increased the life
span of the SOD1 (found mainly in the cytosol) and SOD2 (localized in the mitochondrial matrix) mutants, suggesting that copper supplementation increases longevity
by reducing or removing the superoxide production (revised in Mocchegiani et al.
2012), a process that involved iron import by Fet3p/Ftr1p (Botta et al. 2011).

###### ***2.5.2 Flies, Worms and Rotifers***

Research involving mammals as a first approach is expensive, complex and fraught
with ethical concerns. As an alternative model, invertebrate model systems such as
nematodes and fruit flies, in the last decades have contribute to translational research
investigating metal genetic diseases and aging process, leading to biological findings
that are broadly applicable to human health and disease (Murthy and Ram 2015).
In particular, the Cu homeostasis response in *Drosophila melanogaster* is highly
conserved with humans, including molecular determinants, signaling pathways and
regulation mechanism. Several articles have been published with studies about Cu
homeostasis and flies, including dietary absorption, transport and storage, as well
as regulation, together with the ever-improving arsenal of available genetic tools.
In terms of aging and copper, a classic work by Massie et al. in 1984, showed
that flies fed with copper (1 mM or higher) significantly reduce its life span. On
contrary, a combination of copper gluconate and gluconic acid extend the life span
of *D. melanogaster* by 21.5%, retarding the normal age-related accumulation of the
metal.

As well, worms and rotifers organisms also have appeared as excellent models to
study the influence of copper over the aging process. Studies made in *Caenorhabditis*
*elegans*, showed that worms fed with a normal diet increase its copper levels as
a function of age. Moreover, this copper accumulation contributes to age-related
protein aggregation, similar phenotype occurred in humans during the formation
of toxic oligomers of peptides such as β-amyloid and tau in Alzheimer’s disease
(Klang et al. 2014). Additionally, high concentrations of copper significantly reduce
the life-span of *C. elegans*, accompanied by detrimental effects on brood size and
development problems (Harada et al. 2007).
Rotifers are useful model organisms for aging research, owing to their small body
size (0.1–1 mm), short lifespan (6–14 days) and the relative easy in which aging and
senescence phenotypes can be measured. The life-span of the rotifer *Asplanchna*
*brightwelli* is reduced in a 9% when is exposed to high copper concentrations. In
addition, lipid peroxidation measure was significantly higher at the end of this treatment in relation to the control scenario (no Cu added), damage probably produced
by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a consequence of the high Cu
diet (Enesco et al. 1989). ***2.5.3 Mice***

Potential risks associated with high chronic copper intake from foods and water have
been a concern to health researchers, but ethical constraints limit maximum doses
and exposure periods, the levels tested have not exceeded the upper limit defined as
safe for humans (Araya et al. 2012).

2 Copper 47

Using mice as a model, Massie and Aiello (1984) found that increased ingestion
of copper in the form of gluconate (CuG) reduced the survival time as much as 14.4%
in male rats. Copper, thus may play an integral role in the degenerative processes of
aging. However, earlier results on CuG human supplementation (Pratt et al. 1985)
showed that 10 mg of CuG per day for 12 weeks had no significant differences in
serum, hair, and urine levels of copper. In other hand, capuchin monkeys exposed
to copper at doses up to 50 times the current upper level enhanced expression of
genes related to inflammation and injury without clinical, blood biochemical, or
histological evidence of liver damage (Araya et al. 2012).
###### ***2.5.4 Cellular Senescence: In Vitro Models***

Cellular senescence had been studied for at least for four decades. It had been demon
strated that normal cells in culture had a limited ability to proliferate. Normally cells
in cultures conditions initially exhibit active cell division, but, after a number of
population doublings, dividing cell number decreases and at the end they cease
dividing. Cellular senescence was firstly described by Hayflick and Moorhead, who
demonstrated that serially cultivated human diploid fibroblasts ceased dividing after
a number of population doublings and became unresponsive to mitogenic stimuli,
thus entering in a condition termed replicative senescence (RS) (Matos et al. 2014).
Matos et al. (2012), showed that sub-cytotoxic copper sulfate concentration was
able to induce senescence features on WI-38 human fibroblasts, similar to the effects
of other well-known stress inducer premature senescence (SIPS) agents (such as:
hydrogen peroxide, tertbutylhydroperoxide, ultraviolet B radiation or ethanol). They
observed changes in: cell morphology (cell enlargement), changes in proliferation, in
senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, and increased senescence-associated
gene expression (such as p21, apo-lipoprotein J, fibronectin, transforming growth
factor β-1 (TGF β1), insulin growth factor binding protein 3, and heme oxygenase 1).
It had been demonstrated that a cellular level, resveratrol (a natural polyphenolic
compound) showed to attenuate senescence features in cellular models of replicative
senescence, H2O2-SIPS or cells exposed to copper, thru the resveratrol ability to activate sirtuin 1 deacetylase (Sirt1) (Matos et al. 2017). Sirt1 overexpression attenuates
senescence and extends replicative lifespan in different cultured cells types, such us
human endothelial cells (Ota et al. 2007); human diploid fibroblasts (Huang et al.
2008); human umbilical cord fibroblast (Yamashita et al. 2012). Then, the resveratrol
effect result from its ability to promote cellular adaptive mechanisms, as autophagy
up-regulation, which sustain cellular proteostasis and confer cellular resistance to
stress (Matos et al. 2017).

###### **2.6 New Technology to Study the Role of Copper** **on the Ageing**

New technologies have emerging in order to study the role of copper on the ageing.
Today, we understand that ageing is a complex process which involved several adaptation mechanism, variables and stimulus. Currently, “omics technologies” appears
as an excellent alternative to integrate all this information into global mathematical
models in order to contribute to a better understanding of the role of copper during
the ageing (Méplan 2011).
A meta-analysis collected 27 global gene expression profiles from different agerelated organism, including mice, rats and humans (de Magalhães et al. 2009). These
results declared that genes encode for proteins involved in detoxification of copper where significantly overrepresented inside the group of overexpressed genes,
highlighting the importance of this process during aging.
In order to obtain insight about the genetic control of copper affected pathways
during ageing, a genome-wide transcriptomic assay was performed in the long-lived
model of *Podospora anserine* growing in a copper deplete scenario (Servos et al.
2012). The data showed that more than 4700 genes where differentially activated.
Beside components involved in oxidative stress protection and copper resistance,
genes encoding for proteins related to energy metabolism, respiration, iron homeostasis and protein quality control also changes its transcriptional abundances. These
results strongly support the idea that copper depletion in ageing involved the transcriptional regulation of a huge number of genes, suggesting a complex regulatory
network coordinating the expression of these elements. In addition, was possible to
identify new targets related with copper homeostasis and ageing, demonstrating the
importance to use system biology approaches to identify new biomarkers to monitor
these processes. **2.7 Copper Toxicity**

Today, copper has many uses and utilities, is used as a metal or alloy in machinery,
construction (mainly in domestic water pipes), transportation, and military weapons
and is an important component of white gold and other alloys used for imitation
jewelry, dental products, intrauterine devices, in cosmetics and as bactericide in
handrails, butchery plates and clothing. While, the exposure to Cu through these
items is not harmful, the exposure to elevated concentrations of Cu is damaging,
because its redox activity. Similarly to iron, copper through the Fenton reaction, is
capable of produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Gaetke and Chow 2003).
Cu is a transition metal that, like the rest of this type of metals (except Zn), has
electrons unpaired in its outer orbitals. Cu as well as iron can participate in Fenton
(2.1) and Häber-Weiss (2.2) reactions that produce ROS:


-----

2 Copper 49

Cu [1] + H 2 O 2 → Cu [2] + OH · + OH [−] (2.1)

Cu [2] + O [·] 2 [−→] [Cu] [1] [ + O] [2] (2.2)

Cu [1] salts react with H 2 O 2 more efficiently than Fe [2] . Therefore, the main mechanism of copper-mediated toxicosis may rest on its ability to cause ROS overproduction and subsequent pro-oxidative damage to lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins. Cu [+]

ion can rapidly oxidize the S-nitrosothiol groups of proteins, as does the cupric ion
in the presence of GSH, cysteines or ascorbate. This fact is of the utmost importance
since in this way the ions derived from Cu can interfere with signaling pathways from
which the oxidized proteins are part. There is increasing evidence that an increase
in ROS (because of high ions Cu concentrations) may induce auto-phosphorylation
of tyrosine kinases (TK) receptors of the plasma membrane. This activation may in
turn lead to the activation of the PI3 K/Akt pathway (phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt),
where PI3 K is recruited to the plasma membrane through its SH2 domain. Once on
the membrane, PI3 K phosphorylates phospholipid PIP2 (inositol-3,4-bisphosphate)
to produce PIP3 (inositol-3,4,5-triphosphate) which is required to capture proteins
with PH domain (pleckstrin homology), such as Akt (also called protein kinase B,
PKB) and PKD1 (protein kinase D1). Finally, PKD phosphorylates and activates Akt,
which will also trigger activation and inhibition of proteins by phosphorylation. In
turn, it is very interesting to note that Cu [++] can directly activate (ligand independent)
the PI3 K/Akt pathway.
Activation of TK receptors by ROS is also directly relate to the MAPK (mitogen
activated protein kinase) pathway. Cu ions can induce the activation of the MAPK
pathway, especially by increasing the ERK (extra-cellular regulated kinase) activity,
because of an increase in ROS. Beside, an increase in ERK activity would also
lead to an increase in the activity of effector caspases 3 and 7, phosphorylating
and inactivating, the anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family, which leading to
programmed cell death.
Peroxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) increases atherogenic risk. Exposure of LDL to Cu [2] is one of the most common ways to initiate this oxidation in vitro.
Although the relevance of these ions in the initiation of LDL oxidation in vivo is
not entirely clear, it is possible that in the absence of chelating agents for Cu [2] is
reduce to Cu [1] converting the hydroperoxides into alkoxyl radicals. In the absence of
hydroperoxides, the oxidation would be initiated by the OH· radicals generated from
the reduction of O 2 by Cu [1] . Cu [2] ions can bind to a finite number of sites in the LDL
molecule corresponding to histidine residues of apo-lipoproteins B-100. There is a
progressive increase of TBARS in isolated human LDL, product of the oxidation of
the PUFAs by reduction of Cu [2] to Cu [1] . Increased ROS and LDL peroxidation may
trigger pro-inflammatory stimuli inducing changes in the endothelial cell phenotype.
These changes allow the passage of modified LDL particles and certain leukocyte
strains through the endothelial barrier, trapping them in the sub-endothelial space.
The sub-endothelial deposits thus formed stimulate the entry of macrophages and
CDn lymphocytes among others, and the release of enzymes such as myeloperoxidase and iNOS inducing the formation of ROS/RNS with subsequent generation of


-----

50 M. Arredondo et al.

peroxynitrite. Thus, larger amounts of oxidized LDL (LDLox) are formed which lose
their ability to bind to LDL receptors on the cell surface (Park 2009). In turn, LDLox
have affinity for a family of receptors expressed in macrophages, called scavenger
receptors that recognize and internalize LDLox. The changes caused by this extracellular signal cause macrophages to accumulate large amounts of cholesterol and
other lipids. After a prolonged period, the macrophages will have transformed into
foam cells that are part of a complex structure called “atherogenic plaque” (Brewer
2010).
In addition, Cu also cause marked disruption of the endocrine system. One of the
mechanisms of Cu ions to interfere with the normal functioning of the endocrine
system is shifting from its natural positions to other metals that act as cofactors, thus
modifying the functionality of many transporter, receptor and enzymatic proteins.
This occurs for example with the structure of the so-called Zn fingers that has the
estrogen receptor protein and other steroids to bind to the acceptor site on the DNA.
When there is an increase of Cu in relation to Zn, the latter is replaced by Cu causing
the receptor to lose its specific function or modify it (Ziyatdinova et al. 2006). It is also
widely demonstrated that copper has important effects as a cytotoxic and genotoxic
agent developing undoubtedly a role in the etiopathogenesis of neoplasias. This latter
mechanism relies on the production of damage in the molecular structure of the DNA
by indirect route (ROS) or directly by complex formation with functional groups of
the nitrogen bases that modify them by introducing mutations, or making difficult
the process of repair of errors.
###### ***2.7.1 Excess/Toxicity and Age-Related Disease: Childhood*** ***and Ageing***

Copper toxicosis covers the entire range of ages, so for example, hepatic copper
accumulation has been observe in a variety of pediatric liver diseases including Wilson disease (WD), Indian childhood cirrhosis (ICC), the non-Indian disease termed
idiopathic copper toxicosis (ICT), and disorders associated with chronic cholestasis. WD, ICC, and ICT are believed to be primary copper-associated liver diseases
with distinguished epidemiologic, clinical, and biochemical characteristics as well
as distinct histologic features (Müller et al. 1998).
Inlate70 [′],Popperetal.(1979),describedthreecasesofIndianchildhoodcirrhosis,
a copper toxicosis different from that in Wilson’s disease. They concluded that there
was a distinctive pattern in the distribution of the excess copper in the last stages of
the illness and they suggests that there was a genetically determined abnormality of
copper metabolism. However, if ICC is due to hepatic copper toxicosis, why only
Indian children should be involved, in a particular age group, from certain castes, and
predominantly boys? Accumulation of copper in hepatocytes may be a secondary
phenomenon and this copper in bound form is non-toxic to the hepatocytes. It is
however true, that milk boiling and storing in brass utensils, which are either without


-----

2 Copper 51

or inadequately tin coated, may be the source of high copper intake in ICC patients as
40–60~ of the dietary copper is absorbed in the gut. Thus, the accumulation of copper
in ICC is well documented, but it is not likely to be the only etiology of this unique
disease. In general, Cu ingested in food and water does not result in clinical toxicity
because the amount is relatively low and importantly, because Cu homeostasis is
well maintained by a combination of decreased absorption and increased excretion.
Amongst the unusual circumstances that have led to clinical toxicity in children, is
accidental ingestion of Cu sulfate, which is used as a pesticide crops.
As was commented above, the basis of Cu toxicity is ascribed to its propensity
for producing free oxygen radicals within the hepatocytes resulting in severe intranuclear and cytoplasmic damage. This initiates infiltration of immune and connective
tissue cells to repair the damage. Long-term toxicity, therefore, is typically manifested in the development of liver cirrhosis along with hemolysis and damage to
renal tubules, brain and other organs. Of the clinical situations, Wilson’s Disease
occurs because of a genetic disorder in the excretory arm of Cu metabolism leading
to large amounts of intra-hepatic Cu. However, the Indian childhood cirrhosis and
the similar idiopathic copper toxicosis is thought to occur mainly due to high dietary
Cu. Then, the mechanism of toxicity of Cu involved, therefore, may entail another
insult (environmental or genetic) in addition to increased Cu intake. Hepatic Cu is
also raised (to modest degrees) in other chronic liver disorders such as biliary atresia
and chronic active hepatitis; but this is likely to be related to the effects of the disease
process rather than its cause (Pandit and Bhave 2002).
Consuming Cu-contaminated water or foods is associated with development of
acute gastrointestinal symptoms but not with increased mortality from liver disease.
Cu poisoning may result in weakness, lethargy, and anorexia in the early stages as
well as erosion of the epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal tract, hepato-cellular
necrosis in the liver, and acute tubular necrosis in the kidney. The estimated lethal
dose of Cu in an untreated adult is about 10/20 g (Barceloux 1999).
Chronic Cu toxicity primarily affects the liver, because it is the first site of Cu
deposition after it enters the blood. Cu toxicity is typically manifested by the development of liver cirrhosis with episodes of hemolysis and damage to renal tubules, the
brain, and other organs. Symptoms can progress to coma, hepatic necrosis, vascular
collapse, and death. In addition, chronic Cu toxicity in dialysis patients receiving
dialysis via Cu tubing, workers using pesticides containing Cu, and in infants maintained for long periods on intravenous total parenteral nutrition.
Certain medical conditions, particularly those involving obstructive bile excretions such as primary biliary cirrhosis, obstructive hepatobiliary disease, extrahepatic
biliary atresia, neonatal hepatitis, choledochal cysts and a-1-antitrypsin deficiency,
predispose the patient to increased Cu concentrations (Beshgetoor and Hambidge
1998).
Abnormalities of Cu binding proteins play an important role in Menkes disorder
and Wilson’s disease. Menkes syndrome is an X-linked Cu deficiency disorder that is
usually fatal in early childhood. Patients with Menkes disorder present with mental
retardation and neuro-degeneration mostly because of a deficiency of Cu-dependent
enzymes necessary for brain development (Mercer 1998). Wilson’s disease is an


-----

52 M. Arredondo et al.

autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized by a marked increase of Cu in
the liver and brain (Scheinberg and Sternlieb 1996) because of a reduced capacity
for biliary and other means of Cu excretion. An alteration in the ATP7B gene on
chromosome 13 (Brewer et al. 1999) affects the Cu transporting enzyme, adenosine
triphosphatase, which is key to excretion of Cu into the bile. Cu accumulates in
a patient’s hepatocytes, because it is not used in the synthesis of ceruloplasmin or
excreted normally in the bile. The excess Cu builds up in the liver, leading to cirrhosis,
and is deposited in other extra-hepatic tissues.
###### ***2.7.2 Neurodegenerative Diseases***

Cu is an important component of proteins essential for neural functioning. However,
Cu has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
(ALS); Dementias with vascular origin (RV), spongiform encephalitis (CreutzfeldJakob Disease), and with Huntington’s disease, among others. These diseases are
characterized by the development of neuronal degeneration and progressive loss of
synapses with the consequent deterioration of the superior functions, as a consequence of an increase in the concentration of Cu, Fe and Zn, especially in the tissues
of the central nervous system (Cerpa et al. 2005).
All neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the presence of intra- or
extra-cellular deposits of proteins that produce neuronal damage and contribute to
the development of the pathophysiological of the disease. However, these deposits
cannot be consider as etiopathogenic factors responsible for the diseases, since the
soluble intermediates that will later form the aggregates are more toxic than the
deposits themselves (Kozlowski et al. 2009).
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting
upper and lower motor neurons, which leads to progressive muscle weakness, atrophy, and death often within 3 years of the onset of symptoms (Waggoner et al. 1999).
Rosen et al. (1993), showed that 10% of cases of ALS are familial, and approximately 20% of them are due to mutations in the gene encoding cytosolic copper/zinc
superoxide dismutase (SOD1). The evidence indicate that the neurological damage
in the ALS arise from gain-of-function associated with these abnormal SOD1 alleles, which inducing an increased free-radical generating activity, associated with the
copper bound by the mutant SOD1 enzymes (Yim et al. 1996).
Alzheimer’s disease, is an incurable and progressive neurodegenerative disorder,
characterized by neuronal degeneration, the gradual development of severe cognitive impairments, loss of different types of memory, personality changes, anomia,
apraxia and a great variety of other characteristic signs and symptoms. One of the
most evident (although not pathognomonic) histological features of this disease is the
aggregates of extracellular amyloid plaques in the neocortex, containing β-amyloid
peptide (Aβ) (derived from the amyloid precursor protein, APP) and a neurofibrillary intracellular framework rich in hyperphosphorylated tau protein (Hooijmans and


-----

2 Copper 53

Kiliaan 2008). The aggregation of Aβ peptide is associated with a conformational
change from α-helix to β-sheet, as a consequence of age or some pre-existing pathological condition. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a transmembrane protein
with an extracellular region that can be divided into several domains including the
copper binding domain (Cu-BD) (Kong et al. 2008), which act as reductases (Cerpa
et al. 2005). Metals are significantly increased specifically within Aβ plaques, copper
(390 μM), zinc (1055 μM) and iron (940 μM) are all elevated within neurons as compared with the normal age-matched cells (79; 350 and 340 μM, respectively) (Hung
and Barnham 2012). Thus, Cu [2] would increase Aβ toxicity through the formation of
ROS (Kozlowski et al. 2009). Although, it is unclear whether this occurs during the
formation of β-amyloid aggregate or once it has matured (Andersson et al. 2002). On
the other hand, it is believed that there would be anomalies in the cellular transport
system of the metals involved in Alzheimer’s disease (especially Fe and Cu) (Liu
et al. 2006). Crouch et al. (2009) reported that an increase in the availability of intracellular Cu would increase the phosphorylation of the glycogen-synthase-kinase-3β
(GSK3β) enzyme, thereby decreasing its activity, and hence tau phosphorylation.
There is an association between increased concentrations of Cu, Fe and Zn with
increased deposits of β-amyloid protein in the brain. In AD, the amyloid precursor
protein, which has been directly linked to early-onset forms of the disease, contains
a Cu-binding site. The binding of Cu [2] to amyloid precursor proteins in vitro results
in the oxidation of two cysteine molecules to cystine and produced two electrons. As
only one electron is needed to reduce Cu [2], the remaining electron may be involved
in the production of hydroxyl radicals. The binding of β-amyloid protein to Cu and
Zn could promote ROS generation. Although, the etiology of AD is unclear, there is
much evidence suggesting a state of oxidative stress as a prodrome to the symptoms
that characterize this disease (Smith et al. 2007; Moreira et al. 2008). In addition,
there are studies that show that lipoperoxidation and oxidation of proteins and nucleic
acids occur—and even precede—the slight cognitive impairments (sometimes undetectable) that represent the early stages of AD.
Parkinson’s disease (PD), like AD, is a disease with multiple etiological causes,
among them genetics and environmental factors. Many researchers have demonstrated that occupational (and other environmental-related) factors are significantly
associated with the incidence, prevalence and clinical progression of this disease
(Gorell et al. 2004). Individuals suffering from this disease shown the characteristic
tremors at rest, slowness in movements (bradykinesia), rigidity and general postural
instability with changes in gait, perception, psychism and cognitive abilities. This
is due to the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons from the compact pars of
the substantia nigra (SNpc). In the affected neurons can be observed round hyaline
cytoplasmic inclusions, called Lewy bodies (LB). These bodies and neurite involved
are composed of normal and truncated, ubiquitinated proteins, stored in the cytoplasm as undegraded products of the neurodegenerative process (Ferrer 2009). The
major component of LB and aberrant neurites is the α-synuclein protein, which is
found to be abnormally phosphorylated, nitrated and oxidized, and therefore much
more prone to the formation of insoluble aggregates and fibers. The characterization of the interaction of Cu [2] with α-synuclein shows that this metal accelerates


-----

54 M. Arredondo et al.

the protein aggregation at physiological concentrations without altering the resulting fibrillary structures (Kozlowski et al. 2009). Oxidative stress is also a factor of
undoubted importance in the pathogenesis of PD. There is a decrease in the activity
of the enzymes of the antioxidant defense system and an increase in the oxidation of
biomolecules (Ferrer 2009). Uversky (2007), had reported that high concentrations
of metals, exposure to pesticides and herbicides, among other factors, facilitate the
formation of fibers. Snyder and Friedman (1998) demonstrated that an increase in
intracellular concentration of Cu in cells treated with L-DOPA and dopamine would
decrease cell proliferation and increase the formation of micronuclei.
On the other hand, Atox1, a Cu transport protein, is a Cu-dependent suppressor of oxidative damage in yeast lacking SOD. Neuronal cell lines transfected with
the Atox1 gene to increase the endogenous level of Atox1 expression are protected
against serum starvation and oxidative stress. Thus, Atox1 may play a role in preventing neuronal cells against oxidative damage induced by Cu.
###### ***2.7.3 Treatments to Combat Metal Overload***

Inallthispatients,theincorporationofCu-chelatingagentshasbeenshowntoprevent
neuronal death (Armstrong et al. 2001; Velez et al. 2008). An approach to developing
potential disease-modifying drugs for AD is to inhibit the interactions between Aβ
and metals that drive the pathological features of AD, such as amyloid deposition
and oxidative stress. For instance: (1) inhibiting Ab:metal interactions by selectively
occupying the metal binding site on Aβ, thus preventing metal coordination; (2)
to identify a class of molecules that will effectively compete with the interaction
Aβ-metal ions. A logical approach is the use of metal chelators (desferrioxime,
penicillamine and trientine), which have been used clinically for decades to target
metal in diseases such as hemochromatosis (iron) and Wilson’s disease (copper).
However, these types of chelators are inappropriate as potential therapeutics for AD
due to the requirement of being able to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB); this
generally requires small hydrophobic molecules (Hung and Barnham 2012).
The development of metal regulators as drugs to restore metal homeostasis in AD
brains is still at its very early stage compared with other pharmacological approaches.
The copper chelation is one of the alternatives as a treatment for this disease. There
are several chelator specific for copper (for more details see Robert et al. 2015),
among them:

(1) Pyrrolidine Dithiocarbamate (PDTC). PDTC is capable of transferring external
Cu [2] into a cell to rescue in vitro hippocampal neurons from the toxicity of Aβ
oligomers and to reduce tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus of transgenic
APP/PS1 mice.

(2) Pyridine derivatives such as: (a) 2-methylaminopyridine derivative, that was
shown to chelate Cu [2] and Zn [2] . In vitro, was able to control Cu- or Zn-induced
Aβ aggregation and to modify the structure of metal-induced Aβ aggregates,


-----

2 Copper 55

possibly via a ternary 2-methylaminopyridine–Zn–Aβ complex; (b) Dipyridine
derivative: ENDIP forms a highly stable tetradentate 1/1 complex at physiological pH with Cu [2] and Zn [2] . This compound is able to displace Cu [2] from Aβ and
thus to prevent the metal-induced amyloid aggregation and resolubilize amyloid
precipitates.
(3) Reduced Schiff Base Derivatives. These compounds containing a reduced salen
structure,wereproposedtoretrieveCu [2] fromCu–Aβ,topreventAβ aggregation,
and to act as antioxidants.

(4) Bis(hydrazide). In an Aβ overexpressing Drosophila transgenic model of AD,
treatment with Bis(hydrazide) compound reduces the Cu-induced retinal neurotoxicity.
(5) Bis(thiosemicarbazones) (BTSC). Cu [2] -(BTSC) complexes are stable with a
square planar N 2 S 2 geometry and are capable of crossing cell membranes.
(6) Peptides. A dodeca-peptide prochelator was designed to be enzymatically activated by β-secretase to yield a chelator able to extract copper from Aβ and to
protect against copper-induced ROS formation.
(7) Multifunctional Ligands. In order to improve efficiency and selectivity, ligands
able to chelate metal ions and to interact with other Alzheimer’s disease targets
have been proposed. For example, several ligands able to interact with Aβ, or
to inhibit monoamine oxidase, AChE or BuChE.
(8) Clioquinol, PBT2, and Other 8-Hydroxyquinolines. Clioquinol (5-chloro-7iodo-8-hydroxyquinoline,isanonspecificcopper–zincchelator,abletodecrease
Aβ deposits and to improve learning and memory capacities of APP transgenic
mice. Unfortunately, clioquinol, induced subacute myelo-optic neuropathy and
was withdrawn from the market.

The association of these diseases with transition metals is characterized by oxidative damage to lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. Oxidative damage in the brain also,
could result from interactions between Cu and homocysteine, a thiol-containing
amino acid. The toxicity of homocysteine/Cu co-incubation is dependent on the
ability of homocysteine to reduce Cu [2], as indicated by the inhibition of toxicity with
the Cu specific chelator bathocuproine disulphonate. Homocysteine, also generates
high levels of H 2 O 2 in the presence of Cu [2] and promotes amyloid b protein/Cu mediated H 2 O 2 production and neurotoxicity. These findings suggest that increased Cu
and/or homocysteine levels in the elderly could promote significant oxidative damage to neurons and may produce AD or related neurodegenerative conditions. Metal
chelating agents such as ammonium tetrathiomolybdate have been shown to prevent
neuronal death of rats caused by intra-hippocampal injections of cupric sulfate, ferric citrate, and zinc chloride. The toxic effects of Cu [2], Fe [3] and Zn [2] are prevented
by ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid (CaNa 2 EDTA). Also, disodium bathocuproine
disulphonate prevents neuronal death caused by Cu [2] but not Fe [3] or Zn [2], while desferrioxamine increases neuronal death caused by Cu [2] . Chelating agents are recommended in severe poisoning, but little pharmacokinetic data on humans exist to guide
their use. Either intravenous CaNa 2 EDTA or intramuscular trientine is the agent of
choice in a severe ingestion. D-Penicillamine may be administered orally, if toler

ated, to non-penicillin-allergic patients; however, case reports have not documented
the effectiveness of these chelating agents following the ingestion of large doses of
copper (Barceloux 1999).
Neurodegenerative conditions may also be influenced by the interaction between
Cu and dopamine. In a rat substantia nigra neuronal cell line, Cu neurotoxicity was
dependent on dopamine-mediated Cu uptake and one-electron reduction of aminochrome. This result suggest that Cu neurotoxicity depends upon the formation of
Cu dopamine complexes with concomitant dopamine oxidation to amino-chrome.
Salsolinol (SAL), a novel dopaminergic catechol tetrahydroisoquinoline neurotoxin,
may contribute to the etiology of Parkinson’s disease and neuropathology of chronic
alcoholism. The viability of rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells reduced by SAL
treatment is exacerbated by Cu [2], while Cu chelator bathocupro-inedisulfonic acid
ameliorates the cytotoxicity. SAL in combination with Cu [2] also induces strand scission in pBR322 and phiX174 supercoiled DNA, and causes hydroxylation of salicylic
acid to produce 2,3- and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acids. Reaction of calf thymus DNA
with SAL and Cu [2] results in substantial oxidative DNA damage as determined by
8-OH-dG formation. As the neurotoxic properties of SAL are inhibited by GSH and
catalase, it is suggestive that SALundergoes redox cycling in the presence of Cu [2] with
concomitant production of ROS, particularly hydroxyl radicals, which contribute to
DNA damage and cytotoxicity (Jung and Surh 2001).
A number of nutrients may interact with Cu and alter its toxicity. Information
available shows that vitamin E is largely protective against Cu induced oxidative
damage. Results obtained from in vitro and cell culture studies generally support the
view that ascorbic acid is capable of catalyzing the initiation of oxidative damage
by Cu. However, results obtained from available in vivo studies suggest that the
compound is protective. High dietary ascorbic acid and Zn may protect Cu toxicity
by reducing its intake. Se, beta-carotene, alpha-lipoic acid and polyphenols may also
afford some protection against Cu induced oxidative damage. Further research is
needed to better understand the cellular effects of Cu and its functional interaction

with other nutrients.

Cu would also cause marked disruption of the endocrine system (Astiz et al.
2009). One of the mechanisms of Cu ions to interfere with the normal functioning
of the endocrine system is shifting from its natural positions to other metals that
act as cofactors, thus modifying the functionality of many transporter, receptor and
enzymatic proteins. This occurs for example with the structure of the so-called Zn
fingers that has the estrogen receptor protein and other steroids to bind to the acceptor
site on the DNA. When there is an increase of Cu in relation to Zn, the latter is replaced
by Cu causing the receptor to lose its specific function or modify it. In addition to
the mechanisms mentioned above, it has been known for many years that copper has
effects as an immuno-suppressant (Wataha et al. 2002).

###### **2.8 New Perspectives in Copper and Ageing**

Aging is a complex process influenced by several factors, including Cu. As mentioned in this chapter, the imbalance of this metal conduces to healthy problems in
elder population, from nutritional problems and neurodegenerative diseases to cellular damage and molecular malfunctioning. All the showed evidences support the
existence of a complex relationship at several levels between Cu and aging, which has
led to the use of diverse biological models and the development of new technology
to address studies in this field from an integrative and systemic point of view. **2.9 Conclusive Remarks**

- Copper is an essential metal for the life of all organisms from fungi and bacteria
to the human.

- Because of its redox activity, copper at high intracellular concentrations is potentially toxic to the cell.

- Wilson’s disease and Menkes’s disease are associated with an alteration in the

transport of the metal in the organism.

- There is evidence that strongly associates copper with aging, mainly through the
reduction of the ability to combat oxidative stress damage.

- Cu has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as
Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Dementias with vascular origin, spongiform encephalitis (Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease), and
with Huntington’s disease, among others.

#### **Selenium**

**Halyna Antonyak, Ruslana Iskra, Natalia Panas and Roman Lysiuk**

**Abstract** Selenium, discovered in 1817 by Jöns Jacob Berzelius, is known as an
element with two faces in relation to human health: as a micronutrient essential for

life and a potentially toxic trace element. Important biological functions of selenium
are associated with selenoproteins that contain it in the form of selenocysteine (Sec),
known as the 21st amino acid in the genetic code. Human selenoproteome contains
25 selenoproteins, including glutathione peroxidases, thioredoxin reductases and
iodothyronine deiodinases. As a component of selenoproteins, selenium participates
in defence against oxidative stress, maintenance of cellular redox status, redox signaling and thyroid hormone metabolism. Human selenoproteins are involved in a host
of processes and cellular functions such as immune and anti-inflammatory reactions,
cell proliferation and apoptosis, thyroid hormone activation and inactivation, fertility
mechanisms, and detoxification of harmful substances. Several selenium compounds
exhibit protective effects against cancer. Thus, adequate dietary selenium intake is
essential for health and protects organism against diseases and age-related disorders.
However, selenium can have an adverse effect on health at high exposure due to the
narrow margin between the amount that is essential and the levels associated with
toxicity.

###### **3.1 Introduction**

Selenium (Se), a chemical element of the 16th group of the periodic table, was
discovered in 1817 by Jöns Jacob Berzelius who named it after Selene, the Hellenic
moon goddess (Berzelius 1818). For a long time, selenium was known only because
of its toxicity and was identified as an essential element for mammals in the 1950s
(Schwarz and Foltz 1957). Studies conducted in the 1970s have revealed selenium to
be an integral part of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase (Rotruck et al. 1973), and
subsequently other important selenoproteins such as iodothyronine deiodinases and
thioredoxin reductase were discovered (Köhrle 1996; Gladyshev et al. 1996).
Selenium is included in the selenoproteins in the form of selenocysteine (Sec)
recognized as the 21st amino acid, whose incorporation into the protein molecule is
determined by the UGA codon (Stadtman 1996).
Human selenoproteome contains 25 human selenoproteins, involved in basic cellular processes, from maintaining selenium homeostasis to regulating the overall
metabolic rate (Kryukov et al. 2003; Reeves and Hoffmann 2009). A variety of
selenoproteins have been also detected in microorganisms, with at least 15 different
types of selenoproteins encoded by the bacterial and archeal genomes (Kryukov and
Gladyshev 2004). However, selenoprotein genes have not been found in higher plants
and yeast (Lobanov et al. 2009).
Numerous animal experiments and clinical observations have shown selenium
as an important micronutrient, essential in trace amounts for cellular functions in
humans and animals, but toxic at higher concentrations. Endemic diseases associated
with both selenium deficiency (Keshan disease and Kashin–Beck disease) and with
its excess (selenosis) in some geographic regions of the world have been extensively
described (Huang et al. 2013; Kraus 2015). Selenium deficiency has been implicated
in a variety of conditions, including suppression of immune function, inflammatory
diseases, endocrine system disorders, an impaired reproductive function, cardiac,
muscular and skeletal diseases, brain disorders and cancer. Conversely, adequate
selenium status is needed to the proper involvement of selenoproteins in vital processes such as defence against oxidative damage, redox signaling, control of cell
proliferation and apoptosis, protection against bacterial and viral infection, thyroid
hormone activation, fertility and reproduction (Spallholz et al. 1990; Snityns’ky˘ı and
Antoniak 1994; Arthur 2000; Arnér and Holmgren 2000; Antoniak et al. 2002a, b;
Snitynskyetal. 2006;ReevesandHoffmann 2009).Furthermore,someSe-containing
compounds were shown to exhibit a chemopreventive effect against cancer (Rayman
2005; Yamanoshita et al. 2007). In addition, selenium can counteract the destructive
effects of many harmful substances, including xenobiotics, natural toxins and heavy
metals (Ip and Lisk 1997; Antonyak et al. 2008, 2015; Brigelius-Flohé and Kipp
2013; Antonyak and Skab 2013; Amara et al. 2013; Long et al. 2016; Hoivanovych
and Antonyak 2015, 2017; Cao et al. 2017).
Thus, selenium is a trace element with a wide-ranging role in maintaining human
health and can be involved in mechanisms related to human longevity. In this aspect,
an adequate dietary selenium intake is of great importance. However, many people

in a number of countries may be deficient in this mineral because of the low selenium concentration in the soils or because of poor availability of soil selenium for
agricultural plants (Combs 2001; Ivory and Nicoletti 2017). Therefore, selenium biofortification of plant products attracts attention as a means of preventing Se deficiency
in humans and farm animals (Schiavon et al. 2016).
On the other hand, in recent decades, selenium has received much attention as a
potential contaminant in the human food chain because of its biotransference and biomagnification in the components of aquatic ecosystems (Barwick and Maher 2003;
Schneider et al. 2015). Therefore, monitoring the selenium content of foods is necessary to prevent the harmful effect of this element, taking into account environmental
contamination by selenium from anthropogenic sources.
###### **3.2 Selenium in the Environment**

Selenium is a chalcogen with an atomic number of 34 and an atomic mass of
78.96, which occupies a position between sulfur and tellurium in the periodic
table of chemical elements. Selenium exists in several oxidation states (including −2, 0, +4, and +6) that affect its solubility, mobility in the environment and
bioavailability. Selenium is found in the environment as inorganic species such
as selenide (Se [2] [−] ), selenite (SeO 3 [2] [−] ) and selenate (SeO 4 [2] [−] ), and a range of Secontaining organic compounds. Soluble inorganic selenium forms, the selenite
and selenate, predominate in waters and are widely distributed in soils. Biologically and environmentally important organic selenium compounds include selenoamino acids selenocysteine (Sec), selenomethionine (SeMet), selenomethylselenocysteine (SeMeSeCys), the dipeptide γ-glutamyl-selenomethylselenocysteine (γglutamyl-SeMeSeCys), and volatile dimethylselenide (DMSe) and dimethyldiselenide (DMDSe) (Martens 2003). Selenocysteine is the principle chemical form of
Se in animal and human tissues, where Sec is used in the synthesis of selenoproteins.
The mean concentration of selenium in the earth’s crust is 0.083 mg/kg. The
highest levels of selenium are found in some types of sedimentary rocks such as
shale (up to 675 mg/kg in black shale) and phosphatic rocks (up to 300 mg/kg).
Selenium can be detected in coals and other organic-rich deposits at concentration
1–20 mg/kg (Plant et al. 2005). Selenium content of soils varies in wide range, but
most soils contain it at concentrations from 0.1 to 2.0 mg/kg (Oldfield 2002). Soils
with elevated levels of selenium (>0.5 mg/kg) are considered to be seleniferous,
since cultivated crops and fodder plants grown on those soils absorb Se more than
the maximum permissible level for human and animal consumption. In some parts
of the USA, India and China, these soils contain selenium at concentrations up
to 10, 20 and 20–60 mg/kg, respectively (with some exceptionally high levels of
more than 100 mg/kg in the soil of Enshi County, China) (Plant et al. 2005; Yuan
et al. 2012). The extremely high selenium concentration (up to 1200 mg/kg) have
been reported in organic-rich soils derived from black shale in Ireland (Plant et al.
2005). In contrast to relatively limited distribution of soils with high selenium levels,


-----

large areas of agricultural soils on a global scale have low selenium concentrations.
Selenium-deficient soils have been found in Western Australia, New Zealand, China,
eastern part of the Russian Federation, several parts of the USA, Canada, the United
Kingdom, Finland, Denmark, and other countries (Oldfield 2002; Fordyce 2013).
Selenium is required as a trace element for vertebrates, algae and bacteria, but
it has not been proven to be an essential micronutrient for higher plants. However,
all plants are able to absorb selenium from the soil and convert inorganic Se compounds into Se-containing amino acids, which are then nonspecifically inserted into
plant protein molecules (Abrahams 2008). Selenomethionine predominates among
organic selenium compounds in plant tissues, while several plant species such as
garlic, onion, leek, broccoli, and radish can accumulate selenium in the form of
selenomethylselenocysteine (Wu et al 2015; Schiavon et al. 2016).
Selenium concentration in vegetation usually reflects the content of the element
in soils and can range from 0.005 mg/kg in plants growing in Se-deficient soils
to 5500 mg/kg in Se-hyperaccumulator plants growing in seleniferous soils (Plant
et al. 2005). Selenium hyperaccumulators, which concentrate the element to toxic
levels (i.e., more than 1000 mg/kg) are among the species of the genera *Astra-*
*galus*, *Haplopappus*, *Machaeranthera*, *Neptunia*, and *Stanleya* (Plant et al. 2005;
Fordyce 2013). Phytoavailability of selenium depends on its chemical form and soil
characteristics. Generally, the bioavailability of various forms of selenium in soils
can be placed in the following order: selenate>SeMet>Sec>selenite>elemental
Se>selenide (Abrahams 2008). Plants and microorganisms can volatilize assimilated
selenium into the atmosphere. DMSe and DMDSe are the major gaseous compounds
emitted during plant growth and from soil microorganisms in the course of selenate
and selenite metabolism (Martens 2003).
In the hydrosphere, selenium levels are low and reach an average of 0.17 μg/L
in seawater (Thomson et al. 2001), and 0.2 μg/L in most uncontaminated freshwaters. However, selenium concentrations can be significantly higher (up to the level
650 μg/L) in water bodies receiving irrigation drain water from seleniferous soils
or agricultural lands. Selenium accumulates both in aquatic plants and in aquatic
animals, and there is evidence of biotransference and biomagnification of this element in aquatic food webs with high final levels in carnivorous fish tissues (Barwick
and Maher 2003; Schneider et al. 2015). In freshwater reservoirs contaminated with
industrial selenium, a high level of Se accumulation in fish used in human nutrition
can pose a risk to human health.
###### **3.3 Selenium in Human and Animal Nutrition** ***3.3.1 Need for Selenium in Humans***

The evidence of the need for selenium as a micronutrient in mammals was obtained

in 1957, when it was demonstrated that sodium selenite administration prevented the


-----

3 Selenium 67

development of liver necrosis in rats receiving vitamin E-deficient diets (Schwarz
and Foltz 1957). Importance of selenium to human health was clearly demonstrated
in the 1970s, when it has been shown that sodium selenite supplementation is an
effective means of preventing the Keshan disease, endemic cardiomyopathy in some
regions of China (Keshan Disease Research Group 1979).
Another proof of the importance of selenium for health was obtained in 1979
with clinical observation of a patient supported by complete parenteral nutrition who
developed a selenium deficiency accompanied by myopathy symptoms that were
corrected after selenium supplementation (van Rij et al. 1979).
According to the recommended dietary allowance (RDA), established by the Food
and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the US Institute of Medicine (IOM), the consumption
of selenium should be as follows: 55 μg/day in persons aged 14–70 years and older;
60 and 70 μg/day in pregnant and lactating women, respectively (IOM 2000). Recommended levels of daily intake of selenium in children depend on age and are of
20, 30 and 40 μg for children 1–3, 4–8 and 9–13 years old respectively. For infants
from 0 to 6 months and 7–12 months, adequate intake (AI) of selenium is of 15 and
20 μg per day, respectively (IOM 2000).
In the European Union, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has established a level of adequate selenium intake for adults at 70 μg per day (EFSA Panel
on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies, 2014). Selenium deficiency in humans
occurs when daily intake falls below 20 μg (Calello 2010), and 40 μg Se per day is
considered the minimum intake in adult persons.
###### ***3.3.2 Source of Selenium in Human Diet***

The source of selenium for humans is both the foods of animal origin (meat, marine
and freshwater fish) and plant foods, such as cereals and other grain products.
However, most plant foods consumed by humans are associated with the nonaccumulating group of vegetation, which, if grown on non-seleniferous soils, usually
contain low selenium levels (<1 mg/kg dry mass (DM)) (Abrahams 2008). Unlike
agricultural crops, the seeds of Se-accumulating Brazil nut tree ( *Bertholletia excelsa* )
contain 8–83 mg Se per kg (Thomson et al. 2008).
Selenium content of beef meat is about 0.2–0.3 mg/kg, whereas its concentrations
in heart, liver, and kidney tissues of beef are 0.55, 0.93, and 4.5 mg/kg, respectively;
the average content of selenium in chicken meat is ~0.2 mg/kg; Se content of fish
ranges from 0.1 to 5.0 mg/kg (Garousi 2017).
Some species of wild-grown edible mushrooms such as representatives of the
genera *Albatrellus*, *Boletus*, *Macrolepiota*, *Agaricus* are naturally rich in selenium.
Extremely high Se concentrations (up to 370 mg/kg DM) were detected in the rarely
consumed *Albatrellus pes* - *caprae*, while the fruit bodies of *Boletus eduilis* contained
up to 70 mg Se per kg DM (Falandysz 2008).

68 H. Antonyak et al.

Selenium yeast produced by growing selected strains of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*
in Se-rich media contains 90% of its Se as selenomethionine and is a source of organic
form of selenium for farm animals and humans.
###### ***3.3.3 Endemic Diseases Related to Selenium Deficiency***

Although only a trace amount of selenium is required to maintain important physiological functions in the human body, it has been postulated that the vast majority
of the world’s population has suboptimal Se intakes (Haug et al. 2007). Between 0.5
and 1 billion people suffer from selenium deficiency, because their Se consumption
is lower than the recommended intake levels for this microelement (Combs 2001).
Inadequate or only marginally adequate dietary selenium intakes have been reported
in many regions of the world, especially in countries where selenium content of soils
is low or where soil selenium is poorly available for food crops due to soil features
(Oldfield 2002). The lowest selenium consumption (7–11 μg/day) has been registered in parts of China characterized with extremely low selenium content of soils
(Yuan et al. 2012). Two major endemic pathologies resulting from severe selenium
deficiency in humans have been documented: Keshan disease (endemic cardiomyopathy, which got its name from a serious outbreak in Keshan County, China in 1935)
and Kaschin Beck disease (osteoarthropathy), endemic in some regions of China and
adjacent territories.
Keshan disease occurs in a wide geographic belt stretching from Heilongjiang
Province in the northeast China to Yunnan Province in the southwest and primarily
affects children under 15 years of age and young women. The disease manifests itself
as an acute insufficiency of the heart function or as a chronic heart enlargement and
is potentially fatal. Histopathologically, Keshan disease is characterized by multifocal necrosis and replacement fibrosis of the myocardium, which leads to acute or
chronic heart failure. During 1974–1977, successful trials with the giving of sodium
selenite (Na 2 SeO 3 ) tablets to over 8000 children in the endemic regions of China
have provided evidence of the efficacy of selenium in preventing the disease (Keshan
Disease Research Group 1979). Although Keshan disease is closely related to poor
selenium nutritional status, it has been shown that Coxsackie virus is a cofactor in
the disease (Beck 1999).
Kashin-Beck disease (KBD) is a severe, progressive osteoarthropathy, endemic in
a region extending from north-eastern China to Tibet in the southwest, with additional
endemic regions in neighbouring areas of Russia and some regions of Vietnam and
Korea (Kraus 2015). The disease starts in childhood and is characterized by chronic
disabling degenerative osteoarthrosis affecting the peripheral joints and the spine
with apoptosis of the cells of hyaline cartilage tissue (Yang et al. 2017). Impairment
of movement in the extremities is followed by bone development disturbances such
as shortened fingers and toes and in more extreme cases, dwarfism. In addition
to selenium deficiency, other factors, such as iodine deficiency, contamination of
grain with mycotoxin-producing fungi, and pollution of drinking water with humic


-----

3 Selenium 69

substances, have been convincingly associated with Kashin-Beck disease (Kraus
2015).
In farm animals, selenium deficiency induces poor growth, decreases reproductive
fertility and causes pathological states such as nutritional muscular dystrophy (white
muscle disease) in calves and lambs; stillbirths and retained placenta in ruminants;
nutritional myopathy and mulberry heart disease in pigs (Koller and Exon 1986;
Vlizlo et al. 2006).
###### **3.4 Metabolism of Selenium in the Organism** ***3.4.1 Selenium Absorption, Distribution in the Tissues*** ***and Excretion***

Selenium is present in foods in the form of seleno-amino acids and as inorganic
compounds (selenate and selenite), with selenomethionine being the dominant form
of dietary selenium. Selenomethionine is synthesized by plants and can be consumed
by humans in plant and animal proteins that contain non-specifically incorporated
SeMet.AnotherSe-aminoacid,selenocysteineisconsumedmainlyinanimal-derived
selenoproteins. Dietary Se is readily absorbed primarily in the duodenum, but also
in the caecum and colon (Bates 2009). In healthy humans, SeMet, selenate and, presumably, Sec are absorbed almost completely, while the level of selenite absorption
generally exceeds 50%. Selenomethionine is absorbed via the gut methionine (Met)
transporter, and Sec is taken up probably via the cysteine (Cys) transporter (Bates
2009). Selenate is considered to be transported by a sodium-mediated carrier mechanism shared with sulfur, whereas selenite is passively absorbed through the intestinal
wall (Wastney et al. 2011).
After absorption, SeMet can be incorporated non-specifically into a variety of
proteins in place of methionine and is present in Met-containing proteins in blood and
tissues throughout the body (Burk and Levander 2005). This process is not regulated
by selenium status, but depends on the availability of SeMet. However, SeMet is
not available for the synthesis of functional selenoproteins until it is catabolised
and converted to selenocysteine by transsulfuration pathway in the liver or kidney.
Selenium then enters the regulated selenium metabolic pool and can be incorporated
into selenoproteins, transported to other organs, or excreted.
Selenocysteine, taken up by the cell or derived from the degradation of intracellular selenoproteins, is catabolised by selenocysteine β-lyase with liberation of the
reduced form of selenium, selenide. Ingested selenate and selenite are also metabolized to selenide. Selenide can enter the anabolic pathway by enzymatic conversion to
selenophosphate (a precursor of selenocysteine in the synthesis of selenoproteins),
can be transformed to an excretion form, or can be modified for transport out of
the cell. Metabolism of selenide is considered to be the likely point of homeostatic
regulation of selenium in the cell (Sunde 2012).


-----

70 H. Antonyak et al.

The distribution of selenium between organs and tissues is adapted to ensure
the maintenance of important Se-dependent functions. At normal dietary levels, the
highest selenium concentrations are found in the liver and kidney, followed by spleen,
pancreas, heart, brain, lung, bone and skeletal muscle. When considering total body
mass, 25–50% of body selenium was found in skeletal muscle, 16% in bone, 7–10%
in blood and 4% in kidney (Zachara et al. 2001).
Homeostasisofseleniuminthebodyisachievedthroughregulationofitsexcretion
(Burk and Levander 2005). Most of the selenium is excreted by the kidneys (60%);
intestinal excretion of selenium is about 35 and 5% is excreted in sweat or saliva.

Under physiological conditions, Se excretion in urine is the main means of regulating
the selenium content. At very high selenium intakes, the volatile Se compounds are
exhaled, and the breath becomes a significant route of selenium excretion (Sunde
2012).
Most excretory metabolites of selenium have been characterized as methylated
forms produced in the liver or kidneys. The major methylated Se metabolites are
dimethylselenide, which is excreted through the respiratory system and sweat, especially at high levels of selenium intake (this compound is responsible for the garlic
odour of persons exposed to excess selenium), and the trimethylselenonium ion
(Me 3 Se [+], TMSe), which is excreted in the urine. Under conditions of deficient to
adequate selenium intakes, a large portion of urinary Se is present as methylated
selenosugars (Francesconi and Pannier 2004).
###### ***3.4.2 Synthesis of Selenoproteins***

The main biological functions of selenium in vertebrates are attributed to its biochemical effects mediated by the spectrum of selenoproteins, all of which contain selenium
in the form of selenocysteine (Stadtman 1996). Synthesis of selenoproteins depends
on the translational recoding of the UGA codon in mRNA (which usually acts as a
stop codon during translation) to allow Sec incorporation into protein primary structure. Only proteins that are genetically programmed and perform essential biological
functions are classified as selenoproteins (Hatfield and Gladyshev 2002). Although
human and animal proteins also contain the non-specifically inserted SeMet, they are
not considered selenoproteins. The nonspecific incorporation of amino acids SeMet
or Met is directed by AUG codon and no significant distinctions in the biochemical
functions have been observed.

Selenocysteine is an analogue of cysteine with a Se-containing selenol group
in place of the sulfur-containing thiol group in Cys, but is more active than Cys
because of a lower *pKa* value and a stronger nucleophilicity. Selenocysteine was
identified as the 21st amino acid in the 1980s, when it has been demonstrated that
Sec incorporation into proteins is genetically encoded (Lee et al. 1989).
The biosynthesis of selenocysteine and its cotranslational incorporation into
selenoproteins are highly regulated. Unlike other amino acids, Sec is synthesized in
a specific way on its transfer RNA, tRNA [[Ser]Sec], which possesses the anticodon for


-----

3 Selenium 71

UGA (Lee et al. 1989; Stadtman 1996). During this process, tRNA [[Ser]Sec] is initially
aminoacylated with serine, then phosphorylated to form phosphoseryl-tRNA [[Ser]Sec],
and converted to selenocysteyl-tRNA [[Ser]Sec] . The carbon skeleton for selenocysteine
is provided by serine, whereas selenophosphate (SePO 3 ) produced during selenide
metabolism is a selenium donor compound. Process of sec-tRNA [[Ser]Sec] synthesis
in mammals involves several enzymes, including phosphoseryl-tRNA [[Ser]Sec] kinase,
pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent Sec synthase, and selenophosphate synthetase 2
(SPS2), which itself is a selenoenzyme (Squires and Berry 2008).
The insertion of Sec into selenoprotein primary structure is determined by the
presence of UGA in the open reading frame of selenoprotein mRNA and a stemloop structure, known as the SECIS (selenocysteine insertion sequence) element, in
the 3 [′] -untranslated region (3 [′] -UTR). Absence of the SECIS element or its modification causes the UGA to function instead as a termination codon. In eukaryotes,
two specific protein factors facilitate the Sec insertion at the UGA: the selenocysteine binding protein 2 (SBP2), which binds to the SECIS element, and elongation
factor for selenocysteine (eEFsec), which binds to the sec-tRNA [[ser]sec] (Driscoll and
Copeland, 2003). These proteins associate to each other and form a complex that
delivers the sec-tRNA [[ser]sec] to the ribosome to incorporate Sec into the growing
polypeptide chain. Several additional factors with roles in the ribosomal complex
are also important for Sec incorporation into the peptide backbone of selenoproteins
(Squires and Berry 2008).
The process of selenocysteine synthesis in mammals is essential for life, since the
deletion of the gene encoding the selenocysteine tRNA in mice results in embryonic
lethality (Bösl et al. 1997). In contrast to other amino acids, Sec is not recycled
for reincorporation into new proteins but is, instead, degraded to release inorganic
selenium which can be utilized for resynthesis of selenocysteine.
###### **3.5 The Major Selenoproteins and Their Functions**

The human genome contains 25 genes that encode selenoproteins, and the genome
of rodents contains 24 selenoprotein-encoding genes (Kryukov et al. 2003). Among
human and animal selenoproteins, glutathione peroxidases (GPXs), thioredoxin
reductases (TrxRs) and iodothyronine deiodinases (DIOs) are the three most characterized families, while nearly half of the identified mammalian selenoproteins have
not yet been sufficiently studied. Selenoproteins exhibit diverse patterns of tissue
distribution and have the broad spectrum of biological functions such as antioxidant defence (GPX1–GPX4 and GPX6; selenoproteins K, R, W), redox signaling
(TrxR1–TrxR3), thyroid hormone deiodination (DIO1–DIO3), selenocysteine synthesis (SPS2), transport and storage of selenium (selenoprotein P), and (potentially)
protein folding (15 kDa selenoprotein (Sep15); selenoproteins N, M, and S) (Papp
et al. 2007). Mammalian selenoproteins can be classified mainly into two groups
according to the location of Sec. One group of selenoproteins possesses Sec in a
site close to the C terminus of protein (TrxRs and selenoproteins S, R, O, I, and K),


-----

72 H. Antonyak et al.

while the other group (including GPXs, DIOs, selenoproteins H, M, N, T, V, and
W, Sep15, and SPS2) has Sec in the N-terminal part and in most cases possesses
thioredoxin fold structure (Lu and Holmgren 2009). Transcription of several selenoproteins (such as TrxR1 and GPX2) is regulated by the redox-sensitive transcription
factor Nrf2/Keap1 system (Banning et al. 2005). The features of most important
selenoproteins are described below.
###### ***3.5.1 Glutathione Peroxidases***

Glutathione peroxidases represent a family of enzymes that catalyze the reduction of
hydroperoxides (hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and/or organic hydroperoxides) using
reducing equivalents from glutathione (GSH) and thus play a key role in defence
against oxidative stress (Arthur 2000). In humans, five Se-containing GPXs, all
separate gene products, have been identified, including cellular (cytosolic) GPX1,
gastrointestinal GPX2, plasma GPX3, its close homolog GPX6, and phospholipid
hydroperoxide GPX4 (Kryukov et al. 2003; Lobanov et al. 2009).

**GPX1**

GPX1, one of the most abundant members of the GPX family, was the first selenoprotein identified in mammals (Rotruck et al. 1973). GPX1 is a homotetramer of ~23 kDa
subunits, each containing a single Sec residue. The enzyme is expressed in all cell
types and is localized in cytosolic, mitochondrial, and, in some cells, in peroxisomal
compartments. GPX1 has substrate specificity to hydrogen peroxide and has been
considered to be the major H 2 O 2 -reducing enzyme. However, GPX1 can also reduce
lipid hydroperoxides and other soluble hydroperoxides after their release from membrane lipids (Arthur 2000; Lubos et al. 2011). GPX1 uses the reduced glutathione as
an obligate co-substrate in the reduction of H 2 O 2, so its activity is often discussed
in parallel with the activity of the NADPH-dependent glutathione reductase, which
supplies GSH for GPX1 function (Snityns’ky˘ı et al. 1996; Antoniak 1998, 2000;
Antoniak et al. 1999; Babych et al. 2000c; Yang et al. 2015). GPX1 accounts for
58% of total selenium in liver (Cheng et al. 1997) and is highly sensitive to dietary
selenium intake. In the brain, GPX1 can play a role in protecting against neurodegenerative diseases (such as Parkinson’s disease and dementia) (Power and Blumbergs
2009).

**GPX2**

GPX2, originally designated as gastrointestinal GPX (GPX-GI), occurs in the cell
cytosol and has tetrameric structure with one Sec residue per unit, but is mainly
expressed in the epithelium of gastrointestinal tract (Chu et al. 1997). The enzyme
is highly expressed in rodent small intestine, whereas in humans it is also found in
the liver, large intestine and several other cells. Similarly to GPX1, GPX2 reduces
H 2 O 2 and fatty acid hydroperoxides, but not phospholipid hydroperoxides (Arthur
2000). GPX2 was found to affect apoptosis and regulate self-renewal of the intestinal
epithelium (Banning et al. 2012); this selenoprotein has also been implicated in the


-----

3 Selenium 73

control of inflammation and malignant growth. GPX2 is upregulated in colon and
skin cancers and in certain cultured cancer cells. GPX2 is a target for Nrf2, and thus
is part of the adaptive response (Brigelius-Flohé 2006).

**GPX3**

A secreted form of GPX, GPX3 is present in plasma and milk and can act as extracellular antioxidant enzyme. GPX3 activity, being very sensitive to the dietary supply
of selenium, is often used as biomarker of nutritional status of this micronutrient
(Combs 2015). GPX3 mRNA is found mainly in the kidney (in particular, proximal tubule epithelial cells), which is considered to be the source of GPX3 (Avissar
et al. 1994). Several other cell types, including heart, lung, placenta, gastrointestinal cells, thyroid, liver, mammary gland, and white adipose tissue were shown to
express GPX3 mRNA and protein (Arthur 2000; Schmutzler et al. 2007). GPX3 in
this context can serve as a local source of extracellular antioxidant capacity. In the
heart, GPX3 mRNA is the third most abundant selenoprotein mRNA detected; levels
of GPX3 in this tissue may have a role in protecting against oxidative damage to
extracellular matrix (Reeves and Hoffmann 2009). In the thyroid gland GPX3 likely
serves to reduce oxidative stress (Schmutzler et al. 2007). GPx3 has been shown to be
upregulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-induced antioxidant responses in human skeletal muscles, suggesting a role for this selenoenzyme in
regulating extracellular oxidative stress that affects insulin resistance (Chung et al.
2009).

**GPX4**

Phospholipid hydroperoxide GPX4 is a multifunctional selenoprotein expressed in a
variety of tissues (Conrad et al. 2007). GPX4 is expressed as mitochondrial, cytosolic,
and nuclear forms that originate from a single gene (Ufer et al. 2008). Expression of
GPX4 forms is regulated at the transcriptional level. The cytosolic form (c-GPX4)
is expressed at moderate levels in most mammalian cells, whereas the mitochondrial
(m-GPX4) and nuclear (n-GPX4) forms are found in large quantities in spermatoid
cells (Tramer et al. 2002; Ufer et al. 2008). Unlike other GPXs, GPX4 is a monomer
that can reduce phospholipid hydroperoxides, but it also catalyzes the reduction of
other lipid hydroperoxides and hydrogen peroxide. GPX4 reduces complex lipid
hydroperoxides even if they are incorporated in biomembranes or lipoproteins and
can use a wide range of reducing substrates as well as glutathione. Depletion of GPX4
induces lipid peroxidation-dependent cell death (Imai et al. 2017). GPX4 specifically
interferes with NF-κB activation by interleukin-1, reduces leukotriene and prostanoid
biosynthesis, prevents COX-2 expression, and is indispensable for sperm maturation
and embryogenesis (Ursini et al. 1999; Brigelius-Flohé 2006). GPX4 is also involved
in the brain function, and its expression is down-regulated in Alzheimer’s disease
(Yoo et al. 2010). In mice, deletion of the GPX4 gene results in embryonal lethality
(Ufer et al. 2008). GPX4 is highly expressed in glioma cells, and its knockdown
inhibits the proliferation and migration of tumour cells (Zhao et al. 2017).

**GPX6**

The GPX6 enzyme is restricted in expression to the developing embryo and olfactory

epithelium in adults (Kryukov et al. 2003). GPX6 is a selenoprotein in humans, but
selenocysteine is replaced by cysteine in the mouse enzyme.
###### ***3.5.2 Thioredoxin Reductases***

Mammalian thioredoxin reductases (TrxRs) are selenocysteine-containing NADPHdependent flavoenzymes that catalyze the reduction of oxidized thioredoxin (Trx) to
a dithiol-containing form Trx–(SH) 2, which is a powerful protein disulfide reductase. Besides controlling the function of the central redox molecule thioredoxin,
TrxRs can also directly reduce numerous substrates (Arnér and Holmgren 2000;
Papp et al. 2007). Three isoforms of mammalian TrxR have been identified: cytosolic/nuclear TrxR1, mitochondrial TrxR2, and testis-specific thioredoxin-glutathione
reductase (TGR/TrxR3). TrxR1 and TrxR2 catalyze the reduction of cytosolic and
mitochondrial thioredoxins (Trx1 and Trx2, respectively), whereas TrxR3 also possesses glutathione and glutaredoxin reductase activity.
TrxRs together with thioredoxins and NADPH constitute the thioredoxin system,
a major redox system involved in vital cellular processes via controlling a redox
state of a variety of proteins (including enzymes and transcription factors) and other
molecules (Papp et al. 2007; Lee et al. 2013; Lu and Holmgren 2014). Thioredoxin system is involved in the reduction of ribonucleotide reductase (an enzyme
essential for DNA synthesis); it can also reduce methionine-sulfoxide reductase and
thioredoxin peroxidase (peroxiredoxin) and is thus involved in the repair of methionine sulfoxide-oxidized proteins or redox signaling via hydrogen peroxide (Lu and
Holmgren 2009). Thioredoxin system catalyzes the reduction of protein disulfideisomerase (PDI), the major enzyme that catalyzes protein disulfide formation within
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Papp et al. 2007). Additional substrates include
two ER proteins, calcium-binding protein 1 and 2 (CaBP1 and CaBP2) involved in
calcium metabolism.

The thioredoxin system plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression through redox control of transcription factors (NF-κB, Ref-1, AP-1, and P53),
glucocorticoid receptor, and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) (Papp
et al. 2007). Consequently, this system is involved in regulation of cellular activities such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and activation of the immune response.
Conversely, TrxR is transcriptionally regulated via an antioxidant-response element
(ARE) (Hintze et al. 2003). The redox sensitive Sec residue within TrxR has been
suggested to act as a cellular redox sensor and regulator of cell signaling in response
to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Papp et al. 2007).
TrxR catalyzes the reduction of NK-lysin (an antibacterial polypeptide produced
by T-lymphocytes) that abolishes its cytolytic activity; thus the enzyme is involved
in protecting the cell against NK-lysin cytotoxicity (Andersson et al. 1996). TrxR
substrates also include a wide range of small molecules such as lipoic acid, vitamins
K and C, alloxan, hydroperoxides, as well as selenium compounds (selenite, selenodiglutathione, methyseleninate, selenocysteine, and ebselen) (Arnér and Holmgren

2000). Some of these selenium compounds (selenodiglutathione and selenite) are
metabolized to hydrogen selenide, the precursor of selenophosphate, which is used
for the biosynthesis of selenocysteine; thus TrxR participates in selenium metabolism
and have a role in controlling selenoprotein synthesis (Papp et al. 2007).
The thioredoxin system is essential for mammalian development, as evidenced
by the early embryonic lethality of mice lacking Trx, TrxR1, or TrxR2 (Conrad et al.
2004). It has been shown that both TrxR1 and TrxR2 are involved in embryogenesis;
however,TrxR2isessentialforhematopoiesis,heartdevelopment,andheartfunction,
whereas TrxR1 controls developmental aspects of embryogenesis (Conrad et al.
2004). Components of thioredoxin system (Trx and TrxR1) are overexpressed in
many malignant cells, which is associated with increased cell proliferation (Papp
et al. 2007).
###### ***3.5.3 Iodothyronine Deiodinases***

Iodothyronine deiodinases catalyze the oxidation/reduction reactions of deiodination of iodothyronines, thereby playing an important role in maintaining systemic
and local homeostasis of thyroid hormones (TH): thyroxine (T 4 ) and triiodothyronine
(T 3 ). The iodothyronine deiodinase family includes three enzymes: iodothyronine
5 [′] -deiodinases type 1 (D1) and type 2 (D2) and iodothyronine 5-deiodinase type 3
(D3), encoded by three distinct genes *DIO1*, *DIO2*, and *DIO3*, respectively (Leonard
1990; Larsen and Berry (1995); Köhrle 1996; Gereben et al. 2008; Bianco 2011).
The D2 and D3 enzymes are selective, that is, D2 only catalyzes outer ring deiodinataion (ORD), and D3 only catalyzes inner ring deiodinataion (IRD), while D1
is a non-selective enzyme and catalyzes both outer and inner ring deiodinataion of
iodothyronines.
The deiodination process, depending on whether it occurs at the 5 [′]  - or 5-position
on the iodothyronine molecule, is involved in thyroid hormone activation or inactivation. The 5 [′] -deiodination (ORD) catalyzed by D1 and D2 leads to conversion of
the prohormone thyroxine to the biologically active T 3, while 5-deiodination (IRD)
catalyzed by D3 (and by D1 under certain conditions) converts T 4 to reverse T 3 (rT 3 ),
an inactive metabolite. D3 also inactivates T 3 to 3,3 [′] -diiodothyronine (3,3 [′] -T 2 ), terminating thyroid hormone action (Köhrle 1996; Bianco 2011).
The first mammalian iodothyronine deiodinase, rat D1, was cloned and identified
as a Sec-containing protein in 1991 (Berry et al. 1991). Subsequently, the D2 and D3
were also shown to belong to selenoproteins. The Sec residue in the catalytic centre
plays an essential role in deiodinase activity. The three types of deiodinases show
considerable similarity in their structure (~50% sequence identity) and belong to
the thioredoxin fold superfamily (Callebaut et al. 2003). All three deiodinases form
homodimers through disulfide bridges, but only one monomer partner is required
for catalytic activity. The enzymes differ in their preference for different iodothyronines as substrates, sensitivity to inhibitors (such as 6- *n* -propyl-2-thiouracil) and
expression level in tissues (Leonard 1990). While D1 and D3 are long-lived plasma

membrane proteins (t 1/2 10–12 h), D2 is an endoplasmic reticulum resident protein
with a half-life of ~40 min, which can be further decreased by exposure to physiological concentrations of its substrate, T 4, and in experimental conditions, rT 3 or
high concentrations of T 3 (Gereben et al. 2008). This D2 inactivating mechanism is
mediated by selective conjugation to ubiquitin; however, enzyme activity is restored
after deubiquitination (Bianco 2011).
Iodothyronine deiodinases are critical for a number of cell systems, both during
development and in adult vertebrates, by controlling processes of activation and inactivation of thyroid hormones; expression and activities of DIOs in cells is regulated by
several hormones, including thyroid hormone, selenium, cytokines and several other
factors (Larsen and Berry (1995); Köhrle 1996; Babych et al. 1998, 1999, 2000a, b;
Antonyak et al. 2002a, b; Köhrle et al. 2005; Bianco 2011; Forrest and Visser 2013).
These mechanisms provide an optimized control of thyroid hormone action on a
cell-specific basis. In addition, deiodinase pathways also modulate thyroid hormone
signaling in disease states, generally affecting the occupancy of thyroid hormone
receptors and the transcription of T 3 -responsive genes.
Altered expression and activity levels of DIOs have been reported in a number of
tumors and cancer cell lines, suggesting a potential involvement of DIOs in cancer
development, in particular in the thyroid (de Souza Meyer et al. 2005).
###### ***3.5.4 Selenophosphate Synthethase 2***

Selenophosphate synthethase 2 (SPS2) in mammals is a selenoenzyme involved in
the synthesis of selenoproteins by catalyzing the formation of selenophosphate from
selenide and ATP. The reaction product, selenophosphate, is used as selenium donor
in the synthesis of selenocysteine on sec-tRNA [[ser]sec] (Low et al. 1995). ***3.5.5 Selenoprotein P***

Selenoprotein P (SEPP1) is a secreted glycoprotein that contains about 50% of the
plasma selenium (Burk and Hill 2009). SEPP1 differs from other selenoproteins
in that it possesses 7–15 selenocysteine residues depending on species (e.g., 10 Sec
residues in the human SEPP1), and the SEPP1 mRNA has two functional SECIS elements in its 3 [′] -UTR (Turanov et al. 2015). The protein is composed of an N-terminal
thioredoxin domain containing one Sec residue and a C-terminal Sec-rich region
containing from 6 to 14 Sec residues (Lobanov et al. 2008). SEPP1 is synthesized
primarily in hepatocytes and is secreted to the plasma in a glycosylated form; this
selenoprotein is also expressed in other tissues and is presumably secreted by them
(Burk and Hill 2009). Concentration of SEPP1 in plasma declines in conditions of
Se deficiency and can be used as a biomarker of selenium nutritional status. Changes
in the selenium intake can be reflected not only in the plasma SEPP1 level, but also
in the content of Sec residues in its molecule (Turanov et al. 2015).


-----

3 Selenium 77

SEPP1 delivers selenium in the form of Sec to other organs and thus serves a
key role in homeostasis and distribution of selenium in the body. Receptors such
as ApoER2 and megalin, members of the lipoprotein receptor family, support the
uptake of SEPP1 into tissues. ApoER2 facilitates SEPP1 uptake into the testes and
brain, while megalin facilitates uptake of filtered SEPP1 into proximal tubule cells
of the kidney (Burk and Hill 2009). SEPP1 may also have antioxidant functions and
protects astrocytes and endothelial cells from oxidative damage. In animal model,
deletion of the SEPP1-encoding gene causes an increase in Se excretion in the urine
and, as a consequence, a decrease in the whole-body selenium content.
###### **3.5.6 Methionine- R -Sulfoxide Reductase (Selenoprotein R)**

Methionine- *R* -sulfoxide reductase (Msr) B1 (MsrB1), also known as selenoprotein
R, is a member of the Msr family of proteins, which catalyze the reduction of oxidized
methionine residues (methionine sulfoxides) (Papp et al. 2007). Oxidation of Met
occurs in response to an increase in ROS and can lead to protein damage. MsrB1 also
binds zinc and is localized in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm (Kim and Gladyshev
2004). It is considered that MsrB1 can potentially mediate the anti-aging properties
of selenium (Papp et al. 2007). MsrB1 may also play an important role in neurologic
conditions. ***3.5.7 Effects of Dietary Selenium on Selenoprotein Levels***

Expression of selenoproteins in tissues is controlled by the level of dietary selenium and exhibits a hierarchical style during selenium deprivation and repletion.
In conditions of selenium deficiency, the significance of specific selenoproteins in
specific tissues may determine the priority of their mRNA and protein expression.
When selenium is limited, expression of certain selenoproteins is terminated by
nonsense-mediated decay of selenoprotein mRNA and a CRL2 ubiquitin ligasemediated degradation (Seyedali and Berry 2014; Lin et al. 2015).
The brain and endocrine tissues are preferentially supplied with selenium, thus,
selenoprotein levels in the brain, testes and thyroid gland are refractory to dietary
selenium deficiency. Selenoproteins expressed in the liver and kidneys are generally more sensitive to dietary selenium fluctuation and significantly decrease under
selenium-deficient conditions (Allan et al. 1999; Lu and Holmgren 2009).

###### **3.6 Biological Functions of Selenium in Humans** **and Animals**

Given the wide range of specific functions performed by selenoproteins, it is obvious
that selenium deficiency can lead to various physiological disorders and pathological
conditions. Severe prolonged selenium deficiency can lead to fatal cardiomyopathy
(Keshan disease), as observed in endemic regions with very low selenium content
of soils. Selenium deficiency can also lead to skeletal myopathy, observed in both
animals (white muscular disease) and in people who are nourished by total parenteral
nutrition (Ishihara et al. 1999). Severe selenium deficiency is important contributing
factor in Kashin-Beck disease (Kraus 2015).
Less-overt forms of selenium deficiency are more frequently observed, and various clinical disorders such as cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic liver disease, viral infection, cancer, systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis
exhibit low plasma levels of selenium (Lockitch 1989; Rayman 2012). This indicates
that low selenium status can predispose to a number of diseases. Conversely, adequate selenium intake is required for normal functioning of the immune, endocrine,
reproductive, cardiovascular, digestive, musculoskeletal and central nervous systems
(Alissa et al. 2008; Boitani and Puglisi 2008; Mistry et al. 2012; Huang et al. 2012).
In addition, selenium has protective role in several types of cancer and some selenium compounds exhibit anticarcinogenic effect (Rayman 2005, 2012). Selenium
also synergizes the action of vitamin E and facilitates metabolism of many xenobiotics and natural toxins; it also has a protective role against heavy metal toxicities
(Fig. 3.1). However, it has been shown that there is a U-shaped relationship between
selenium concentration in the blood and the risk of disease, with possible harm occurring both below and above the physiological range for optimal activity of some or
all selenoproteins (Rayman 2012). Therefore, a high intake of selenium in persons
without a proven deficiency may have adverse effects (such as hyperglycaemia and
atherosclerosis) (Stranges et al. 2010).

**Fig. 3.1** Functions of selenoproteins in human organism

###### ***3.6.1 Selenium and the Immune Function***

The immune system represents one of most selenium-sensitive target systems.
Numerous studies suggest the association of selenium status with humoral and cellmediated immune responses, survival odds in sepsis, risk of autoimmune thyroid
diseases, selenium-dependent infection rates and vaccination responses (Hoffmann
and Berry 2008; Rayman 2012; Ivory et al. 2017). The organs of the immune system such as spleen and lymph nodes accumulate significant amounts of selenium,
and selenoproteins expressed in immune cells determine the role of this trace element in immunity (Kiremidjian-Schumacher et al. 1994; Babych et al. 1998, 1999,
2000a, b; Antonyak et al. 2002a; Snitynsky et al. 2006; Shrimali et al. 2008; Sun et al.
2017). For example, inflammatory response in the pig involves changes in the mRNA
expression of 14, 16, 10, and 6 selenoprotein genes in the liver, spleen, thymus, and
lymph node, respectively (Sun et al. 2017).
Selenium deficiency significantly affects the immune system and leads to impairment of T- and B-cell functions and less robust immune responses to viruses, tumours,
and allergens, compared to Se-adequate controls (Spallholz et al. 1990; Hoffmann
and Berry 2008). It has been shown that selenium supplementation, even in individuals without deficit of this micronutrient, has significant immune stimulatory effects,
including an enhancement of activated T-cell proliferation, increased lymphocytemediated tumour cytotoxicity, and NK cell activity (Rayman 2000, 2012). In particular, supplementation with 100 μg Se per day (as selenium yeast) for 6 months in
older Belgian residents significantly increased the proliferative response of lymphocytes to antigen challenge (Rayman 2000). Selenium supplementation increases the
expression of the high affinity receptor for interleukin-2 (IL-2) in human lymphocytes, which is important for T-cell proliferation. In animal studies, the high selenium
diet increased the expression of IL-2 and the high affinity chain of the IL-2 receptor accompanied by enhanced T-cell signalling and in vivo CD4 [+] T-cell responses.
Increasing dietary Se leads to a shift in the T helper (Th)1/Th2 balance toward
Th1 effector cells. This effect benefits antiviral immune or antitumor responses that
depend on robust Th1 immunity (Hoffmann et al. 2010). ***3.6.2 Selenium and Viral Infection***

Convincing evidence regarding to the involvement of selenium deficiency in viral
infection were obtained from studies of Keshan disease, which has been attributed
to an endemic Coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3). In animal studies, a normally-benign
strain of Coxsackie virus B3 becomes virulent in Se-deficient mice and causes the
development of myocarditis in the host. Mechanism of virulence is thought to be
due to the accumulation of oxidative damage related mutations in the viral genome
(Beck 1999). Thus, selenium deficiency can affect both the immune response of the
host organism and the virus itself.


-----

80 H. Antonyak et al.

Selenium deficiency has been linked to the incidence, virulence, or disease progression of other viral infections, including human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV1) and influenza virus infections (Stone et al. 2010; Hoffmann and Berry 2008). A
number of studies have reported low selenium status in HIV-infected individuals, and
some cohort studies have shown an association between selenium deficiency (serum
or plasma selenium ≤85 μg/L) and progression to AIDS or mortality (Rayman 2000;
Stone et al. 2010). Several randomised controlled trials have shown positive effects
of selenium supplementation in HIV-infected patients (Rayman 2012).
###### ***3.6.3 Selenium and Thyroid Function***

Selenium together with iodine plays a key role in the physiology of the thyroid gland
and is necessary for thyroid hormone metabolism. The thyroid gland is characterized by high concentration of selenium incorporated into selenoproteins. At least 11
selenoproteins are expressed in thyrocytes (Schmutzler et al. 2007), including GPXs
that contribute to the antioxidant defence of the thyroid by removing H 2 O 2 generated
during hormonogenesis, TrxRs that maintain the redox balance in the thyroid and
perform redox control of thyrocyte functions, and DIOs involved in metabolism of
thyroid hormones.
Selenium deficiency can be associated with an increased risk of thyroid disease,
especially in persons with inadequate iodine intake. Combined selenium and iodine
deficiency leads to severe pathologic conditions, including myxedematous cretinism
prevalent in Central Africa (Köhrle et al. 2005). Decreased activity of DIOs and
GPX are both considered to be responsible for the development of this disease, acting
through increased oxidative damage in the thyroid tissue due to insufficient GPX and
reduced thyroid hormone metabolism due to insufficient DIOs. Selenium deficiency
may also be responsible for the initiation of autoimmune thyroid disorders (Köhrle
et al. 2005). Selenium supplementation can be beneficial in thyroid diseases, including autoimmune thyroid disease and thyroid associated ophthalmopathy (Marinò
et al. 2017; Ventura et al. 2017). Supplemental selenium also alleviates the harmful
effects of excess iodine on thyroid gland. ***3.6.4 Selenium and Brain Function***

Selenium is a trace element crucial to brain functions. Mammalian brain cells contain

genes encoding a complete set of selenoproteins, and cerebral cortex, hippocampus,
cerebellum, and olfactory bulb are exceptionally rich in selenoprotein gene expression (Zhang et al. 2008). During selenium depletion the brain selenium level is
maintained at the expense of other tissues whereas severe deficiency of this element
causes irreversible brain injury (Burk and Hill 2009).


-----

3 Selenium 81

Three major families of selenoproteins (TrxRs, GPXs and DIOs) have the most
critical role in the brain by controlling redox status, preventing and reversing the
oxidative damage in neuroendocrine tissues, and providing the involvement of active
thyroid hormone (T 3 ) in the regulation of brain functions. More than 80% of T 3 in the
brain is derived from intracellular deiodination of T 4 by DIO2 (Courtin et al. 1986).
Since circulating T 3 does not readily gain access to intracellular nuclear receptors,
DIO2 provides an important regulatory function in the brain. As is known, thyroid
hormone regulates processes associated with brain differentiation, including dendrite and axon growth, synaptogenesis, neuronal migration, and myelination (Bernal
2007). Impaired thyroid hormone production during the early development of the
child leads to a deficiency in intelligence and sensorimotor functions.
Selenoproteins also contribute to optimal brain functions via redox regulation and
antioxidant protection of cells (Zhang et al. 2010).
Brain is supplied by selenium through selenoprotein P, which is important not only
for selenium transport, but also has a vital role in neurogenesis (Scharpf et al. 2007).
SEPP1 may act directly as an antioxidant to prevent oxidative stress, or may provide
selenium for biosynthesis of other antioxidant selenoproteins. Genetic deletion of
SEPP1 results in decreased levels of mRNAs encoding selenoproteins in brain, most
notably GPX4, and selenoproteins H, M and W (Hoffmann et al. 2007).
Selenium deficiency is associated with cognitive decline; impairment of selenoprotein functions has been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease,
Huntington’s disease, and epilepsy (Pillai et al. 2014). Insufficient selenium intake
can be also associated with an increased risk of depression and a lowered mood status
(Banikazemi et al. 2016). Selenium produces cognitive improvement and can counteract age-related neurodegeneration, which is associated with increased oxidative
stress and instability of the genome, protecting the brain during the aging process
(Zhang et al. 2010; Aaseth et al. 2016). Selenium has protective role in Alzheimer’s
disease, since it is a potent inhibitor of tau hyperphosphorylation, a critical step in the
formation of neurofibrillary tangles. In addition, some Se compounds (e.g. SEPP1)
protect amyloid precursor protein (APP) against excessive copper and iron deposition (Aaseth et al. 2016). Expression of SEPP1 in human brain increases during
aging (Lu et al. 2004), and this effect may have a protective role against age-related
neurodegeneration.
###### ***3.6.5 Selenium and Fertility***

Selenium plays an important role in the male reproductive system, and the testis is
one of the main target organs for this element (Boitani and Puglisi 2008). Selenium
has been recognized as essential micronutrient for male fertility due to its role in the
testosterone biosynthesis and formation and normal development of spermatozoa
(Flohé 2007). It is considered that selenium-regulated spermatogenesis is mediated
mainly by two selenoproteins: GPX4, the most abundant selenoprotein in spermatoid
cells, and SEPP1, which serves as a source of selenium in the testes (Burk and Hill


-----

82 H. Antonyak et al.

2009). GPX4 has a dual role in the testes, since it functions as a GPX and also as
a structural protein involved in the formation of the sperm specific mitochondrial
capsule (Ursini et al. 1999). The genetic variants of the human GPX4 gene have
been related to male infertility.
###### ***3.6.6 Selenium and Cardiovascular Disease***

Several epidemiological studies suggest that selenium deficiency may contribute
to cardiovascular disease (Shamberger 1980; Flores-Mateo et al. 2006; Kardinaal
et al. 1997). Early studies have shown the significantly lower incidence of hypertensive heart disease in Se-adequate areas of the USA compared to Se-deficient areas
(Shamberger 1980). A meta-analysis on the association of selenium biomarkers with
coronary heart disease, which included 25 observational studies and 6 randomized
trials have shown a moderate but statistically significant inverse association between
selenium concentrations in several tissues and coronary heart disease outcomes. In
observational studies, a 50% increase in selenium concentrations was associated with
a 24% reduction in coronary heart disease risk (Flores-Mateo et al. 2006). Potential
cardiovascular benefits of selenium are supported by evidence that selenoproteins
prevent oxidative modification of lipids, inhibit platelet aggregation, and reduce
inflammation (Rayman 2012). Selenium can exhibit protective effects against cardiotoxicity induced by several environmental pollutants such as dimethoate (Amara
etal. 2013).However,randomisedtrialsofselenium-containingsupplementshavenot
shown a significant effect on cardiovascular disease or mortality endpoints (FloresMateo et al. 2006; Stranges et al. 2006). ***3.6.7 Role of Selenium in Detoxification of Harmful*** ***Substances***

Dietary selenium was shown to be a critical modulator of intestinal cytochrome
P-450-dependent metabolism of ingested drugs, carcinogens, and toxins that are
absorbed by the intestinal mucosa (Pascoe et al. 1983); selenium also influences
the xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes in the liver and brain (Erkekoglu et al. 2012;
Caglayan et al. 2016). Selenium exerts a potent protective effect against aflatoxin B 1
(AFB 1 )-induced damage to hepatocytes and other cells (Hoivanovych and Antonyak
2015, 2017; Cao et al. 2017) and protects against zearalenone-induced reproductive
system damage (Long et al. 2016). In addition, selenium is known to counteract
the effects of toxic heavy metals and diminish the harmful influence of Hg, Cd, Pb,
Cr(VI) in the organism (Panas et al. 2003; Solohub et al. 2007; Antonyak et al. 2008;
Antonyak and Skab 2013; Xu et al. 2016).

3 Selenium 83
###### ***3.6.8 Effect of Selenium on Diabetes Risk***

Data from several epidemiologic investigations showed correlations between abnormal glucose or lipid metabolism and decreased plasma selenium concentrations or
GPX activity in diabetic subjects (Mueller et al. 2009). In addition, selenium has
been shown to mediate a number of insulin-mimetic effects both in vivo and in vitro

and activate key proteins involved in the insulin-signal cascade (Stapleton 2000).
These data suggest that selenium can be involved in controlling the blood glucose
level. However, recent animal experiments and human trials have shown a risk of
prolonged high selenium intake in potentiating insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes
(Zhou et al. 2013; Thompson et al. 2016). ***3.6.9 Selenium and Cancer Risk***

There is evidence from basic and clinical studies suggesting higher risk for cancer
incidence in persons with selenium deficiency and a protective role for dietary selenium in various types of cancer (Rayman 2005, 2012; Cai et al. 2016). The results of
recent meta-analysis, which included 69 studies, indicated that high selenium exposure had a protective effect on cancer risk and high serum/plasma selenium had the
efficacy on cancer prevention (Cai et al. 2016). Prospective studies have provided
evidence for a beneficial effect of selenium on the risk of lung, bladder, colorectal,
liver, oesophageal, gastric-cardia, thyroid, and prostate cancers (Rayman 2005, 2012;
Cui et al. 2017).
A number of mechanisms have been suggested to explain the anticancer effects
of selenium, including: (1) reduction of oxidative stress and protection of DNA from
damage;(2)reductionofinflammation;(3)inductionofphaseIIconjugatingenzymes
that detoxify carcinogens and reduce DNA adduct formation; (4) enhancement of
immune response; (5) increase in tumour-suppressor protein p53; (6) inactivation of
protein kinase C (PKC) that plays a crucial role in tumour promotion by oxidants;
(7) alteration in DNA methylation; (8) blockage of the cell cycle; (9) induction
of apoptosis of cancer cells; (10) inhibition of angiogenesis (Rayman 2005; Riaz
and Mehmood 2012). It has been shown that plasma selenium level should reach
approximately 120 μg/L to optimise the anticancer effect of selenium, and the level
of Se supplementation that reduces cancer risk is of 200 μg per day (Rayman 2005).
However, there are contradictory data regarding the effectiveness of selenium
supplementation, and several recent studies have not confirmed the protective role
of dietary selenium in reducing the cancer risk. (Dennert et al. 2011; Vinceti et al.
2014). These include, in particular, the increasing risk of some types of cancer such
as melanoma and lymphoid cancers following selenium supplementation (Vinceti
et al. 2016).
On the other hand, there is evidence of anticarcinogenic activities for several
intermediary metabolites of naturally occurring organic and inorganic forms of sele

84 H. Antonyak et al.

nium. Methylselenol (CH 3 SeH) that has potent anticancer properties can be produced
in vivo during selenium metabolism. In particular, CH 3 SeH can be formed from γglutamyl-selenomethylselenocysteine that is present in plants of the genera *Allium*
and *Brassica* (Rayman 2005).
A range of selenoproteins have been suggested to be involved in protection against
cancer, including TrxR1, Sep15 and GPX2 (Hatfield et al. 2014). However, there is
evidence that these and several other selenoproteins may also be involved in the
promotion of tumour growth and are over-expressed in tumour cells (Hatfield et al.
2014; Schmidt and Arnér 2016). In particular, TrxR1 is over-expressed in many
cancers and malignant cell lines, which is accompanied by increased cell proliferation
(Papp et al. 2007). Currently, TrxR1 is considered a promising target for anticancer
drugs in view of its functional links with transcription factors (such as Nrf2, NF-κB
and p53) and interaction with growth-promoting signaling pathways (Hatfield et al.
2014; Schmidt and Arnér 2016).
###### **3.7 Health Effects of Excess Selenium** ***3.7.1 Selenium Toxicity and Tolerable Upper Level*** ***of Selenium Intake***

Selenium toxicity in animals was first observed in the seleniferous regions in the
middle of the 19th century and confirmed in the 1930s in livestock that consumed
Se-accumulating plants in the western part of the USA (Spallholz 1997). In affected
animals, selenium intoxication caused the acute syndrome of “blind staggers” and
the chronic “alkali disease”, accompanied by blindness, walking in circles, anorexia,
weight loss, ataxia, and dystrophic hooves (Calello 2010).
In humans, typical symptoms of chronic selenium intoxication (selenosis) are
dermatitis, hair loss, nail damage and the characteristic garlic odour of the breath
(Calello 2010). These symptoms are accompanied by the toxic effects of selenium
at the cellular and tissue levels, including liver and kidney damage, blood clotting,
necrosis of the heart and liver, nervous system disorders and gastrointestinal disturbances. From the early 1930s to the 1960s, cases of chronic poisoning of people
with selenium were often observed in Enshi County (Hubei Province of China) with
a high prevalence of the disease in 1961–1964 (Yuan et al. 2012). The blood and
urinary selenium levels in the affected persons were 30–100-fold higher compared
with Se adequate levels, and individual daily selenium intake in this region ranged
from 3.20 to 6.69 mg. In addition to selenosis in seleniferous regions, an excess of
selenium in the body with toxic effects can also occur in other circumstances, including increased consumption of selenium supplements. Environmental contamination
by selenium from anthropogenic sources also creates the risk of excessive selenium
entry into the human body.


-----

3 Selenium 85

Based on the measurement of the indices of selenium status, it has been reported
that selenium homeostasis is disturbed at the daily intake of 750 μg Se or above,
whereas symptoms of selenosis (such as persistent overt fingernail changes) in susceptible persons occur at Se intake of 910 μg/day, corresponding to a blood selenium
level of 1.05 mg/L (Yang et al. 1989). Thus, daily intake of selenium of 750–850 μg
was suggested as the marginal level of safe consumption, and for safety, 400 μg Se
per day was proposed as the daily tolerable upper level (UL) of selenium intake (Yang
et al. 1989). UL is defined as the highest level of daily nutrient intake that is likely to
pose no risk of adverse health effects of almost all individuals. The FNB at the IOM
of the US National Academies has set the ULs of dietary selenium intake as follows:
400 μg for persons aged 14 years and older, and for pregnant and lactating women;
45 and 60 μg for infants from birth to 6 months and 7–12 months, respectively;
90, 150 and 280 μg for children 1–3, 4–8 and 9–13 years old, respectively (IOM
2000). These levels indicate a narrow margin between amount of selenium, which is
needed by the organism and selenium doses that can cause adverse effects on health.
Exceeding the upper tolerable levels of selenium can have an unfavourable effect
on the endocrine system, especially on the thyroid status (Winther et al. 2015), and
increase the risk of type 2 diabetes (Thompson et al. 2016), some specific types of
cancer such as melanoma and lymphoid cancers, and disorders of the nervous system
including increased risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Vinceti et al. 2016).
###### ***3.7.2 Mechanisms of Selenium Toxicity***

As regards to the mechanisms of selenium toxicity, most reports generally attribute
it to the induction of oxidative stress. A number of studies have shown that both

the inorganic selenium compounds and Se-amino acids, if taken in excess, provoke the formation of reactive oxygen species (Spallholz 1997; Mézes and Balogh
2009). These effects can impair the amount and/or activity of antioxidant defence
mechanisms. In particular, selenite can be non-enzymatically reduced in presence
of glutathione, generating selenodiglutathione and superoxide anion radical (O [−] 2 [.] [).]
Superoxide has the harmful effects on iron-sulfur clusters in mitochondrial proteins
and triggers mitochondrial damage. Although the Se-amino acids (SeMet and Sec)
are less toxic than selenite (Mézes and Balogh 2009), recent studies have provided
evidences indicating their cytotoxicity mediated by both oxidative stress and ROSindependent mechanisms (Lazard et al. 2017). These latter mechanisms include disruption of protein homeostasis by Sec misincorporation in proteins and/or reaction
of selenols with protein thiols.
In addition, the replacement of sulfur by selenium in cellular respiration enzymes
can cause mitochondrial disruption, and the substitution of SeMet in place of methionine may interfere with protein synthesis (Calello 2010). The dermal/integumentary
effects of excess selenium such as skin, hair, and nail damage can also be a result of
selenium interpolation into disulfide bridges of keratin and other structural proteins.

###### **3.8 Selenium and Longevity** ***3.8.1 Selenium Intake and Mortality Risk***

Several epidemiological studies suggest an inverse association between serum selenium concentration and mortality risk (Akbaraly et al. 2005; Ray et al. 2006; Rayman
2012). However, a study with 13,887 participants with a follow-up of 12 years has
shown a nonlinear association between the levels of selenium in serum and all
cause and cancer mortality. Increasing serum selenium levels were associated with
decreased mortality up to 130 μg/L, while for serum selenium concentrations of over
150 μg/L a slight increase in mortality risk was observed (Bleys et al. 2008). ***3.8.2 Selenium and Aging***

Increased cellular production of ROS and continuous oxidative damage to cellular components contribute to the process of aging (Petropoulos and Friguet 2006).
Selenium in the form of selenoproteins can potentially delay the aging process and
prevent age-related diseases associated with oxidative stress in various ways: by
removing free radicals and modulating oxidative damage; maintaining the redox
status of cells and preventing protein oxidation; reducing methionine sulphoxides;
providing the availability of active thyroid hormone; and also through its influence
on redox-sensitive cellular signaling pathways. It has been shown that selenium deficiency or insufficient expression of certain selenoproteins can be accompanied by
the appearance of signs of aging, suggesting the involvement of selenoproteins in
protection against aging process. In particular, mice unable to express selenoproteins in epidermal cells show age-related alopecia (Sengupta et al. 2010). Decreased
expression of iodothyronine deiodinases (DIO1 and DIO2) have been implicated in
selenium deficiency-associated diseases of aging in mice (McCann and Ames 2011).
In humans, selenium deficiency in individuals over 65 years old is accompanied with
less peripheral T 3 production from thyroxine because of decreased levels of deiodinase expression (Olivieri et al. 1996). Selenium deficiency has been reported in
Down’s syndrome (trisomy 21), a disorder characterized by premature aging (Neve
et al. 1983). Similarly, decreased selenium levels and GPX activity in blood of children affected by Kaschin-Beck disease have been associated with the presenile tissue
changes observed in this disease (Li et al. 1990).
Different types of glutathione peroxidases that scavenge H 2 O 2 and prevent the
initiation of free radical chain reaction have important roles in protecting against
free radical-induced lesions during aging. It has been hypothesized that GPX may
extend life span of the organism and prevent age-related functional disorders (Riaz
and Mehmood 2012). The cellular redox state maintained by thioredoxin reductase
system is also essential for the physiological responses to oxidative stress and aging.
TrxRs control the availability of reduced thioredoxins, which protect proteins from

oxidative damage (Pérez et al. 2011), and mitochondrial TrxR2 has a crucial role in
the aging heart (Kiermayer et al. 2015).
The methionine- *R* -sulfoxide reductase B1, which catalyze the reduction of
methionine sulfoxides, can also contribute to slowing down the aging process. It
has been shown that mutations leading to a decrease in Msr activities are associated
with a decrease in resistance to oxidative stress and to a shortening of the life span,
while high level of Msr expression leads to an increase in resistance to oxidative
stress and a significant increase in life span (Stadtman 2006). Therefore, MsrB1 is
considered one of the selenoproteins through which selenium exhibits its anti-aging
properties (Papp et al. 2007).
Aging process is accompanied by different changes in selenoprotein expression.
The expression of SEPP1 in human brain increases during aging (Lu et al. 2004),
and this effect, apparently, can contribute to protection against age-related neurodegeneration. The increase of GPX activity was observed in the brain of old rats as an
adaptive effect to the age-related increase of peroxides (Zhu et al. 2006).
Several authors have observed significant up-regulation in GPX protein expression and cytosolic GPX activity in the liver of aged rats (Yang et al. 2015), while
other studies have shown an age-related decline in GPX activity in animal liver,
myocardium and skeletal muscle (Xua et al. 2007).
TrxR2 expression decreases in the heart and skeletal muscle of rats during aging
(Rohrbach et al. 2006; Yoshioka 2015). However, TrxR activity was found to be
elevated in cells from long-lived species of rodents, primates, and birds. Elevated
TrxR activity in long-lived species reflects an increase in the mitochondrial form,
TrxR2, rather than the cytosolic forms TrxR1 and TrxR3 (Pickering et al. 2017).
###### ***3.8.3 Selenium and Longevity***

The cross-sectional studies have demonstrated different changes in selenium levels in blood serum and tissues from older persons (Milman et al. 2004; Letsiou
et al. 2009). Findings from the ATTICA study have shown significant decrease in
selenium concentration with age (18–75 years), and this decline was independent
on anthropometric, lifestyle and biochemical and nutritional indices (Letsiou et al.
2009). Similarly, a study conducted in Italy on healthy subjects showed a decline
in serum selenium level and GPX activity in erythrocytes with age, particularly in
people over 75 years of age (Olivieri et al. 1994). A negative correlation between
selenium concentration in the liver and age was observed in Greenlandic Inuit men.
In contrast, Danish men displayed a positive correlation between selenium content
in the liver and age (Milman et al. 2004).
Several studies have analyzed plasma selenium levels in cohorts of healthy nonagenarians and centenarians in comparison to younger elderly persons (Savarino et al.
2001; Forte et al. 2014; Alis et al. 2016). A study conducted by Savarino et al.
(2001), which included 90 nonagenarians/centenarians (91–110 years, group A) and
62 elderly persons (60–90 years, group B), has shown a significant decrease in serum

selenium levels in the persons of group A when compared with group B, in both men
and women. However, 84.4% of the nonagenarians/centenarians had Se concentrations equal to or greater than the lowest values of the elderly group (Savarino et al.
2001). Similar results were obtained in a study conducted in Sardinia that included
76 nonagenarians (89.0 ± 6.3 years), 64 centenarians (101 ± 1 years) and 24 middleaged subjects as controls (61.2 ± 1.1 years). A comparison among the three classes
of age showed a significant depletion of Se in nonagenarians and centenarians with
respect to controls (Forte et al. 2014). In contrast, a recent study including 81 healthy
centenarians (100–104 years) and 46 healthy younger elderly controls (70–80 years)
showed significantly higher levels of serum selenium in centenarians compared to
younger elderly persons (Alis et al. 2016). All the centenarians participating in this
study were free of major age-related diseases (severe cognitive impairment, clinically evident cancer, cardiovascular disease, renal insufficiency, or severe physical
impairment). Contradictory data obtained in these studies may indicate a complex
relationship between selenium levels in the organism and longevity. Selenium has
multiple roles in human health and is crucial for the proper functioning of the immune
system; therefore, adequate Se levels can potentially impact positively human life
span and health of older persons. In contrast, a decrease in selenium content during
aging may be accompanied by an increased susceptibility to diseases common in the
elderly, a reduced efficiency of immune system, and a deficiency in the conversion
of thyroxine to T 3, which influences general metabolism. However, a decrease in
serum selenium levels in the oldest old persons indicates that the need for selenium
as component of selenoproteins can be more pronounced in young life periods than
in old age.
Data regarding the impact of selenium on life span have been obtained in animal
studies. When studying the distribution of selenium in tissues from 26 mammalian
species, it has been found that the maximum life span is negatively correlated with
the level of selenium in all the analyzed species, and two species of desert-dwelling
African mole rats (the naked mole rat and the Damaraland mole rat), the longest
lived rodents, exhibited a decreased levels of selenium utilization (Ma et al. 2015).
Wu et al. (2017) reported a paradoxical effect of dietary selenium deprivation on
longevity promotion together with the health deterioration in mice. According to
these findings, selenium at low levels may be considered a hormetic chemical, and
a dietary condition decouples healthspan and longevity. The hormetic effect on life
span extension can be mediated by a non-selenoprotein pool of selenium in the
organism (Wu et al. 2017).
###### **3.9 Conclusions**

Chemical element selenium for a long time was known only because of its toxic
effects. Now, selenium is recognized as an essential micronutrient that influences
many functions in mammalian organism. Inadequate dietary selenium intake can
lead to a general decline in health, weakened immune resistance, endocrine disor

ders, inflammatory, cardiovascular and hepatic diseases, cancer, and impaired brain
function. Biologically important effects of selenium are associated with selenoproteins, all of which contain it in the form of selenocysteine residue. Selenoproteins are
involved in the processes of oxidoreduction, antioxidant defence, redox signaling,
thyroid hormone metabolism, selenocysteine synthesis, transport and storage of selenium, mechanisms of fertility, and immune responses. Because of the multiple roles
played by selenoproteins, dietary selenium at recommended levels of consumption
is essential for human health and exhibits beneficial effects.
However, selenium is considered to be one of the controversial elements, since
it can exhibit harmful effects at concentrations exceeding the tolerable upper level.
The U-shaped relationship has been shown between selenium concentration in the
blood and the risk of disease, with possible harm occurring both below and above the
physiological range for optimal activity of some or all selenoproteins. High intake of
selenium can adversely affect the endocrine system and increases the risk of diabetes
type 2, some specific types of cancer and nervous system disturbances.

**John H. Beattie, Marco Malavolta and Irina Korichneva**

**Abstract** Zinc has a critical role in biology due principally to its chemical affinity
for cellular thiol, imidazole and carboxyl ligands. The regulation of zinc homeostasis is critically dependent on zinc transporters and channels since free zinc or zinc
associated with biomolecules is not membrane permeable. While zinc homeostasis
may be maintained at different levels of dietary zinc intake, zinc status may vary
with zinc intake. This chapter gives a detailed description of the current knowledge concerning the relationship between zinc homeostasis, aging and health. How
age-related changes affect zinc intake, metabolism, excretion and homeostasis is
described with a particular focus on the alterations of mechanisms controlling the
function of zinc transporters and other proteins involved in zinc homeostasis. Evidence for the involvement of zinc dyshomeostasis in immunosenescence, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease and frailty is also extensively reviewed. The impact of zinc supplementation in health and diseases is approached considering data from model
organisms to humans as well as the tight relationship of zinc with the insulin and
insulin growth factor (IIS) pathway, which has a well-defined antagonistic pleiotropic
function in aging. This chapter aims to help promote future research into the efficacy
of zinc for prevention of age-related diseases and for therapeutic supplementation.

###### **4.1 Introduction**

Zinc has a critical role in biology due principally to its chemical affinity for cellular thiol, imidazole and carboxyl ligands (Maret 2012). Biology has utilised this
binding affinity in many ways, predominantly for maintaining the tertiary structural
orientation of proteins to fulfil their function. Zinc finger and LIM domain proteins
represent about 10% of the proteome and are absolutely dependent on zinc for their
DNA and protein binding functions (Laity et al. 2001). Many metalloenzymes also
rely on zinc because in an entatic state produced by an enforced stereochemistry
and/or electronic state around the metal, it can be optimally primed for a catalytic
role (Williams 1985). The dominant influence of zinc in human biology is disproportionate to its low geological abundance and implies that maintenance of health
is inextricably linked with the maintenance of zinc status and metabolism. This is
indeed the case and zinc status is avidly maintained across a wide range of dietary
zinc intakes (King et al. 2016). Zinc is therefore described as a type 2 nutrient because
it is not thought to be specifically stored within the body and homeostatic mechanisms work to maintain cellular and plasma zinc levels, even at the expense of for
example growth, tissue repair and immune function (Golden 1996). The regulation
of zinc homeostasis is critically dependent on zinc transporters and channels since
free zinc or zinc associated with biomolecules is not membrane permeable. Human
and animal health is therefore directly related to the expression and regulation of
these transporters and channels and an understanding of their physiological role in
human health and ageing is the subject of this review. **4.2 The Regulation of Zinc Homeostasis**

Dietary zinc is absorbed primarily in the duodenum and is mostly excreted within
pancreatic secretions back into the small intestine. In this way, some recycling of
excreted zinc can occur which means that at the absorption level, body homeostatic
mechanisms can normally be very efficient. Proportionally, very little zinc is excreted
in urine or sweat but significant losses in men can occur through seminal emissions.
Apart from the cellular sites of absorption and excretion, other factors can influence
the efficiency of zinc homeostasis including intestinal bioavailability. Apart from
reduced quantity of ingested zinc, dietary phytic acid content is the single most
important factor which decreases zinc absorption (Miller et al. 2007), but dietary
protein and calcium are thought to promote absorption (Miller et al. 2013). Phytate
(inositol hexaphosphate) comes from plant foods and is rich in cereals, legumes and
their processed products. It avidly binds Zn [2+], Fe [2+], Ca [2+] and Mg [2+] but quantitatively
it has the most significant impact on zinc and non-haem ferrous iron bioavailability.
Nutrition has an impact on intestinal bacterial communities (Flint et al. 2017) and
the impact of the gut microbiota on zinc absorption and, conversely, the impact of
luminal zinc concentration on the gut microbiota, have been investigated (Skrypnik

and Suliburska 2018). In mice, very high levels of dietary zinc (1 g/kg) but not
zinc-deficient diets (no added zinc) were found to change the microbiota β-diversity
during 5 weeks of dietary intervention, as compared to control diets containing 29 mg
Zn/kg (Zackular et al. 2016). However, the effect of the diets on food intake and the
influence of this variable on the data were not reported. The intestinal microbiota
increases in size and complexity from the duodenum to the colon and so there may be
longitudinal variations in the impact of the microbiota on zinc absorption. The highest
zinc absorption efficiency is in the duodenum where there is less microbial species
diversity, but even in the colon, with a quantitatively rich and diverse microbiota,
there is evidence that some zinc absorption or reabsorption may occur. Since the
gut mucosal cells are luminally covered in secreted mucus, there is also a crosssectional gradient of microbial speciation from the centre of the lumen to the apical
membrane of the enterocytes. There is still very little information on how longitudinal
and cross-sectional changes in microbial density and species diversity can impact on
metal absorption.
Using dual isotope tracer techniques, fractional dietary zinc absorption can range
from around 20 to >90% in adult humans (King et al. 2000) and so the capacity to
modulate body zinc homeostasis is considerable. Little is understood about regulatory mechanisms for zinc excretion but both absorption and excretion appear to be
influenced by zinc transporter expression and perhaps function in key cells regulating
influx and efflux of zinc. Using stable isotope methodology, a multiple-compartment
model of zinc has been identified in the human body (Lowe et al. 1997) but essentially there are two major kinetic pools; an exchangeable zinc pool (EZP) which
constitutes about 10% of body zinc and a slowly exchangeable zinc pool comprising
the remaining body zinc (Miller et al. 1994). The EZP has a turnover rate of about
3 days and includes most of liver zinc, part of other soft tissue zinc and blood plasma
zinc. The latter turns over about 150 times per day, is quantitatively only about 2%
of the total EZP and is resistant to reflecting changes in zinc status, which is why it
is not a good biomarker to assess an individual’s zinc status (King et al. 2016).
As would be expected, the size of the EZP is directly correlated with body size
(body weight being the most reliable predictor), and so the EZP is simplistically
normalised using body weight. However, EZP also shows a negative correlation with
age and is higher in men than women, and so a normative model incorporating weight,
age and gender has been suggested (Miller et al. 2017). Normalised EZP size in adult
men showed a significant decrease in response to sustained (>5w) consumption of
moderate and severely zinc-deficient diets. It therefore appears that while plasma
zinc levels may not markedly respond to dietary zinc deprivation, the normalised
EZP size does respond. It is likely therefore that the EZP response is focussed in
soft tissues, particularly the liver. There is evidence that depletion of the EZP has
many signalling consequences, including perhaps the production of a low molecular
weight humoral factor (Ou et al. 2013) which promotes apoptosis in vascular smooth
muscle (Allen-Redpath et al. 2013) and possibly other cell types.
While zinc homeostasis may be maintained at different levels of dietary zinc
intake, zinc status may vary with zinc intake and there is a clear need for better
biomarkers of zinc status (King et al. 2016) to determine reliable reference nutrient

values based on empirical analysis of sensitive biological targets rather than relying
on the factorial approach which is currently the only method available (Gibson et al.
2016). An analysis of zinc adequacy, which may crudely be defined as the EZP
size which meets the most sensitive biological requirements, is therefore essential
for correctly interpreting the impact of changing zinc status. Genetic variation is
another variable which may have a profound influence on zinc requirements. In
extreme cases, rare single nucleotide polymorphisms of key zinc transporters such
as ZIP4 (Kury et al. 2002) and ZnT2 (Chowanadisai et al. 2006) can have severe
consequences, but other less severe mutations with a higher allelic frequency may
have milder consequences that disadvantage the individuals (Giacconi et al. 2015)
or their offspring (Alam et al. 2015) in nutritionally challenging situations, such
as during dietary zinc deficiency or when demand for zinc is elevated. Epigenetic
changes throughout life, stimulated by lifestyle and genetic attributes may have
consequences for the process of ageing and the capacity of body to regulate zinc
homeostasis (Gabbianelli and Malavolta 2018).
###### **4.3 Age-Associated Alterations in Dietary Zinc Intake,** **Metabolism, Excretion and Homeostasis**

Cell senescence may be caused by multiple factors. An age-related decline in mitochondrial function has been reported, resulting in deficits of bioenergetics and the
compromise of cellular capacity to adapt to physiological stress (Gonzalez-Freire
et al. 2015). All cellular processes including ion transport across membranes are
energy-dependent and so cell senescence through mitochondrial disfunction is likely
to have an inhibitory effect on the efficiency of zinc and other metal metabolism.
Indeed, we have already noted in the previous section that the EZP size decreases
with age (Miller et al. 2017). One cause may be a decrease in dietary zinc intake due
to a decrease in food intake (Maret and Sandstead 2006) and/or a change in food
selection. For example, the elderly tend to eat less protein and since protein generally
contains zinc, they also show a decline in zinc intake (Wakimoto and Block 2001).
Appetite diminishes with old age, especially when taste and smell decline and dental
deterioration makes eating some foods, such as red meat, more difficult (Landi et al.
2016). Psychological factors may also impact on food intake and the age-related
decline in food consumption, which is known as anorexia of ageing, can appear in
individuals at around 65 years of age (de Boer et al. 2013).
At an absorption level, the gut microbiota has been shown to change in density
and species diversity in relation to age (Kim and Jazwinski 2018) and there is little
understandingofhowthisimpactsonzincabsorption.Absorptionmechanismsacross
the mucosa involve a closely regulated and coordinated transport of zinc across apical
and basolateral membranes utilising the plasma membrane-bound zinc transporters
ZIP4 and ZnT1, respectively (Cousins 2010). Absorbed zinc is bound to serum
albumin (Handing et al. 2016) and is predominantly taken up by liver hepatocytes.


-----

4 Zinc 103

However, it is ultimately excreted through pancreatic acinar cells and this process is
regulated by the zinc transporters ZIP5 (on the basolateral membrane) and ZnT1 on
the apical membrane (Geiser et al. 2013). The transporter ZnT2 also plays a role in
vesicular excretion of zinc into the pancreatic juice. Ageing results in a decreased
flow of pancreatic juice into the pancreatic duct (Torigoe et al. 2014) which may
impact quantitatively on zinc excretion. Indeed, using dual-isotope tracer techniques,
endogenous zinc losses in the elderly were found to be lower in elderly men compared
to young men (Turnlund et al. 1986).
An overview of the regulatory mechanisms for whole body zinc homeostasis at a
cellular and molecular level is presented in Fig. 4.1. The impact of cell senescence
on the zinc transport efficiency of gatekeeper cells (gut mucosal and pancreatic
acinar cells) is unknown but it is clear that ageing reduces zinc uptake and excretion
efficiency (Turnlund et al. 1986). The function of ZIP7, an endoplasmic reticulumlocated zinc transporter, is regulated by casein kinase 2-mediated phosphorylation
(Taylor et al. 2012) and it is likely that other zinc transporters are similarly regulated.
Mechanisms controlling transporter activation, rather than transporter expression,
may be targets of the ageing process. An assessment of senescence and the function
of key transporters in cells that are gatekeepers of body zinc homeostasis is currently
in progress in an EU-funded RISE grant entitled “Micronutrients in Life Expectancy
and Ageing (MILEAGE)”.
Cell senescence can be modulated by zinc exposure. In human coronary artery
endothelial cells, supraphysiological treatment with 50 μM zinc promotes the development of senescent cells whereas in zinc deficiency, senescent cells are more resistant to zinc deprivation (Malavolta et al. 2017a, b). This senescence-related change
in sensitivity to zinc is probably related to modified transporter activation and/or
function. Since senescence has a broad influence on cell metabolism other factors
may also be involved.
###### **4.4 Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of Zinc** **Dys-Regulation in Aging**

The molecular mechanisms controlling intracellular zinc homeostasis have been
investigated since the discovery and cloning of zinc transporters (Palmiter and Findley 1995). With identification of 10 ZnT family proteins (SLC30 genes products)
and 14 Zip (SLC39 genes) transporters the role of non-specific cationic channels in
Zn permeability across plasma membrane has been demonstrated thus summarizing influx and efflux mechanisms. Finally, exponential growth of the research area

Both excess of zinc and its deficiency are prejudicial to the cells. Zinc excess can
be toxic to cells (Koh et al. 1996), whereas zinc deficiency can be a cause of serious
metabolic disorders (Truong Tran et al. 2003). Therefore, the narrow intracellular

**Fig. 4.1** Key cells in the maintenance of body homeostasis and metabolism of zinc. The gut microbiota and other factors such as dietary phytate may have an impact on zinc bioavailability and
uptake across the gut mucosal cell apical membrane is almost entirely regulated by ZIP4. Free zinc
is buffered by metallothionein (MT) through activation of metal transcription factor 1 (MTF-1) and
zinc is transferred across the basolateral membrane by ZnT1. Binding to serum albumin, zinc is
transported primarily to the liver where it is incorporated into hepatocytes by ZIP10/ZIP14 transportation. A large proportion of this zinc readily fluxes in and out of hepatocytes and so turnover of
liver zinc is rapid. Zinc is taken up into pancreatic acinar cells through ZIP5 which can also shunt zinc
from blood plasma into enterocytes. Zinc is excreted into pancreatic fluid through ZnT2-mediated
vesicular secretion and also through ZnT1. Each of these key transporters may be influenced by cell
senescence and which transporter is quantitatively more significant in affecting zinc homeostasis
during ageing is being investigated by an EU-funded project called MILEAGE

concentration of bioavailable Zn is tightly controlled in pico to nanomolar levels. The
two families of zinc transporters have opposite roles in cellular zinc homeostasis:
ZnT transporters reduce intracellular zinc availability by promoting zinc efflux from
cells or into intracellular vesicles (Palmiter and Huang 2004), while Zip transporters
increase intracellular zinc load by allowing extracellular zinc uptake and vesicular
zinc release into the cytoplasm (Eide 2004). For example, ZIP7 (SLC39A7), has been
shown to be localized on the Golgi complex (Huang et al. 2005) and/or the endoplasmic reticulum (Taylor et al. 2004, 2007) and under certain conditions it releases zinc
from these organelles to the cytosol (Taylor et al. 2012). The transport of zinc ions
may be coupled to exchange for protons as has been shown in case of ZnT1 (Shusterman et al. 2014). More specifically, the authors demonstrated that ZnT-1 facilitates
zinc efflux in a sodium-independent, pH-driven and calcium-sensitive manner. Moreover, substitution of two amino acids in the putative zinc binding domain of ZnT-1

ablated Zn [2+] efflux and rendered the mutated protein incapable of protecting cells
against Zn [2+] toxicity.
The coordinated orchestration of a diverse family of zinc transporters also relies
on non-specific cationic channels that are permeable for Zn, and in some conditions,
contribute to half of the transported ion, e.g. voltage-gated calcium channels or TRP
family channels (Dong et al. 2008; Gibon et al. 2011; Hu et al. 2009; Kovacs et al.
2011; Monteilh-Zoller et al. 2003) or TRP family channels (Bouron et al. 2015).
For example, one of the major routes of zinc entry into most excitable cells is the
L-type calcium channel (Kamalov et al. 2010) and in many other cells the TRP
family channels, particularly the TRPM7 chanzyme. The further complexity of the
system is determined by post-translational modifications of the transporters, notably
phosphorylation as shown for Zip7 and ZnT2 (Taylor et al. 2012; McCormick et al.
2014). In addition, recently described interractions between Zn transporters and ion
channels affect their function. For example, ZnT1 can interact with the beta-subunit
and regulate function of LTCC (Yamasaki et al. 2012).
TRPV6 belongs to the vanilloid family of the transient receptor potential channel
(TRP) superfamily. This calcium-selective channel is highly expressed in the duodenum. TRPV6 is also permeable to zinc and cadmium. Live cell imaging experiments
with Fura-2 and NewPort Green DCF showed that overexpression of human TRPV6
increased the permeability for Ca [2+], Ba [2+], Sr [2+], Mn [2+], Zn [2+], Cd [2+] and interestingly
also for La [3+] and Gd [3+] suggesting that TRPV6 is not only involved in calcium transport but also in the transport of other divalent cations (Kovacs et al. 2011).
A structurally unique TRPM7 channel has been identified as having preferential permeability for Zn as compared to other cations (Monteilh-Zoller et al. 2003),
and it may be itself potentially regulated by Zn while possessing an active serine/threonine kinase at the C-terminus harbouring a zinc finger structure (Clark et al.
2006; Dorovkov and Ryazanov 2004; Perraud et al. 2011; Matsushita et al. 2005).
This suggests that TRPM7 may serve as a redox/zinc sensor and thus be affected by
stress and aging (Krapivinsky et al. 2014). This channel has been implicated in cell
de-differentiation leading to cancer development, and pancreatic cancer in particular,
which has recently been shown to originate from acinar pancreatic cells (Kopp et al.
2012).
###### **4.5 Zinc Regulation of Cellular Signaling Proteins**

While several studies implicated zinc as a player in the activation of kinases (Korichneva JBC) and phosphatases, and it has even been named the «Ca of 21st century»
(Frederickson et al. 2005), the term “a novel second messenger” was first used by
the group of Prof. Hirano in 2008 (Hirano et al. 2008). Since then, multiple studies
have demonstrated the versality of zinc functions in intracellular signaling.
It has already been mentioned that ion channels permeable for zinc, e.g. TRP
family channels are at the same time inhibited by intracellular zinc. A potassium
channel is another zinc target. Zn [2+] inhibited K2P currents in one population of cells,


-----

106 J. H. Beattie et al.

produced biphasic responses in another population, and increased the amplitude of
the PDBu-elicited K [+] currents in a third population of myocytes, suggesting the
expression of several K2P channel types, and providing insights into the interplay
between PKC and PKA pathways that regulate vascular tone (Hayoz et al. 2013).
Another example of convergence of redox and zinc signaling is illustrated by
the study performed on the potassium chanel KV4. The researchers investigated
the redox response at the Zn [2+] binding site in the intracellular T1-T1 inter-subunit
interface of a Kv4 channel, the site that undergoes conformational changes coupled
to voltage-dependent gating. The data showed that nitric oxide strongly inhibited
channel activity and the effect could be reversed by reduced glutathione or suppressed
by the addition of intracellular zinc ions. The authors determined two Zn [2+] -binding
cysteines that were required to observe the NO-induced inhibition (Cys-110 from
one subunit and Cys-132 from the neighboring subunit). The data suggested that the
interfacial T1 Zn [2+] site of Kv4 channels acts as a Zn [2+] -dependent redox switch (to
be discussed further) that may regulate the activity of neuronal and cardiac A-type
K [+] currents under physiological and pathological conditions (Wang et al. 2007).
The principles of signal transduction and a definition of a second messenger first
evolved from the discovery of hormone-regulated adenylate cyclase, an enzyme that
converts the signal from G-protein coupled receptors to the synthesis of second messenger cAMP. Since then, numerous consequences of cAMP-dependent signaling
have been investigated in detail. The developing interest in zinc signaling prompted
the analysis of its effects on membrane-associated and soluble adenylate cyclase. It
has been shown that zinc inhibits hormone and forskolin stimulation of cAMP synthesis in N18TG2 cells. Crystallographic data of the truncated soluble AC suggested a
possible mechanism by which zinc could inhibit AC activity, focusing on Zn [2+] bound
to a site different from Mg [2+] binding sites involved in catalysis. Using extrinsic and
intrinsic fluorescent measurements, the authors showed a conformational response of
the enzyme to zinc binding (Klein et al. 2004). The in vitro results corroborate physiological data in the model of diabetic cardiomyopathy where zinc deficiency and
lowered myocardial adenylate activity commonly occur, and hormonal-stimulated
enzymatic activity of AC is significantly lower in diabetic rats on a low zinc diet
(Mooradian et al. 1988)
ThecomplexityofzinceffectsonMAPkinasescontributestocontroversybetween
the in vitro and in vivo studies. For example, in contrast to zinc deficiency, zinc chelation inhibits activation of p38. It is not clear to what extent the production of ROS
is involved in these effects and whether zinc may have direct regulatory function on
the enzymes. In general, zinc deficiency is characterized by attenuation of growth
factor signalling pathways and an amplification of p53 pathways, while the latter
still requires zinc for normal functioning. The outcome is achieved by hypophosphorylation of the antiapoptotic kinases, AKT and ERK, under the conditions of zinc
deficiency, and activation of p38 and JNK.
Perhaps a better understanding of the regulation of signaling kinases by zinc and
redox changes is accomplished in the studies of PKC isoforms. PKC has always
been the focus of increased interest due to the key role of this enzyme in signal
transduction (Naruse and King 2000). Different isoforms translocate to different


-----

compartments in close proximity to substrates and perform multiple cellular functions. Like other Ser/Thr kinases, PKC is sensitive to variations in zinc concentration.
More than 20 years ago, Forbes and Zalewski demonstrated that micromolar concentrations of zinc chloride induced specific association of PKC with the plasma
membrane or cytoskeleton (Forbes et al. 1990). The attachment of protein kinase C
to the cytoskeleton was accompanied by an enhanced expression of binding sites for
3 H-phorbol ester, a regulatory ligand of protein kinase C. The heavy-metal chelating
agent 1,10-phenanthroline completely reversed the increased [ [3] H]PDBu binding in
cells pretreated with [65] Zn, which was associated with a decline of about 20% in
cell-associated [65] Zn, suggesting that a relatively small pool of intracellular Zn [2+] acts
on PKC. Further numerous measurements of intracellular zinc changes under physiological stimulation of normal wild type cell lines or cultured cells reproducibly
showed from 2 to 20-fold increase in zinc concentrations unlike calcium responses.
The authors suggested that this 20% zinc increase could represent a membraneassociated pool. The active factor in the cytoskeleton was labile to protease, suggesting that protein kinase C binds to a cytoskeletal protein. PKC bound to a Zn [2+]

affinity column and was eluted by a metal chelator, confirming that Zn [2+] interacts
directly with PKC. The authors further proposed that putative binding sites for zinc
were present in the regulatory domain of protein kinase C; however, no distinct role
for zinc was obvious at that time.

Little more than a decade ago we conducted a study focusing on direct action
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the PKC molecule. Independent of the classical lipid-mediated pathway, PKC is also controlled by a redox mechanism. PKCs
embrace two independent target sequences susceptible to oxidative modification
(Gopalakrishna and Jaken 2000). The two domains of PKC respond differently to
redox changes. Thus, oxidation of thiols in the catalytic domains blocks enzymatic
kinase function. More interestingly, oxidation within the regulatory sequence converts the protein to the catalytically competent form, while reduction reverses this
process (Gopalakrishna and Anderson 1989; Knapp and Klann 2000). Physiologically, it would mean that the regulatory domain should be sensitive to lower doses
of oxidants. Another manner in which such preferential oxidation might occur is
through the facilitation of electron transfer by retinoids. It has been found that the
redox activation of the kinase requires cofactors, retinol or its metabolites, since the
high affinity retinoid binding site was mapped to the cysteine-rich regions in the regulatory domains of Ser/Thr kinases (Imam et al. 2001) Remarkably, metabolism of
vitamin A (retinol) increases in heart after myocardial infarction, suggesting mobilisation of healing reserves to protect the heart from oxidative stress (Palace et al.
1999)
In the N-terminal regulatory domain, the 50 amino acid long, highly homologous
stretches containing six conserved cysteine and two conserved histidine residues,
tetrahedrally coordinated by two Zn [2+] ions into a composite zinc finger are targets
of redox control (Zhang et al. 1995). When oxidized, the autoinhibitory function of
the regulatory domain is compromised and, consequently, cellular PKC activity is
stimulated. This topological change is believed to be complemented by phosphorylation, translocation, and Ca [2+] and phosphatidylserine binding, to lock the catalytic


-----

108 J. H. Beattie et al.

domain into an active form. As a part of crosstalk, PKC becomes phosphorylated on
Tyr at residues 512 and 523 under the conditions of oxidative stress (Konishi et al.
1997). Remarkably, both classical and redox activation of PKC trigger the same
event, namely zinc release from the regulatory domain. Phorbol esters mimic the
action of second messenger diacylglycerol by binding to the same motif within the
regulatory domain and activating catalytic activity.
The interest to the mechanism of redox activation of PKC and the role of zinc in

its function continues bringing more data. Recent studies show that increased concentrations of intracellular zinc affected the phosphorylation state and subcellular
localization of PKCδ. More specifically, intracellular zinc inhibited the phosphorylation of PKCδ at Thr505 in a concentration-dependent manner and facilitated the
translocation of PKCδ from the cytosol to the Golgi complex (Slepchenko et al.
2018).
In contrast to activation of kinases zinc ions may inhibit enzymes such as protein
tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and the values for the K i of these enzymes is in a low
pM range. The K i (Zn) value for inhibition of receptor PTPB is 21 pM. The binding is
about as tight as the binding of zinc to zinc metalloenzymes and suggests tonic zinc
inhibition. PTP1-B (PTPN1), an enzyme regulating the insulin and leptin receptors
and involved in cancer and diabetes, has a K i (Zn) value of about 5 nM (Wilson et al.
2012). The enzyme binding of zinc ions with such a high affinity confirms that such
binding is physiologically significant, and the binding constants must be compatible
with the cellular availability of zinc ions (Maret 2013)
To add to potential targets of cellular free (labile) zinc in signaling pathways we
would like to mention the major route of calcium entry into the cell, the Orai1 channel.
Using the cellular model of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma we demonstrated
that elevated zinc targets specific cysteines and histidines of Orai1 to block Orai1mediated intracellular Ca [2+] oscillations and subsequently cell proliferation (Choi
et al. 2018).
In cardiac cells, aberrant Zn [2+] homeostasis is a hallmark of certain cardiomyopathies associated with altered contractile force. The group of SJ Pitt demonstrated
that Zn [2+] is a high affinity regulator of RyR2 displaying three modes of operation.
Picomolar free Zn [2+] concentrations potentiate RyR2 responses, at concentrations of
free Zn [2+] >1 nm, Zn [2+] is the main activating ligand, and the dependence on Ca [2+]

is removed. Millimolar levels of free Zn [2+] were found to inhibit channel openings
(Woodier et al. 2015).
Additionally, regulation of protein function may be mediated by zinc transporters
through protein-protein interaction. For example, ZnT-1, along with its ability to
exchange Zn [2+] /H [+] inhibits the L-type calcium channel (LTCC), a major Zn [2+] and
Ca [2+] entry pathway, the two functions are independent of each other and are mediated
by different parts of the protein. The mutation analysis showed that ZnT-1 performs
two structurally independent functions related to zinc homeostasis (Shusterman et al.
2017).

###### **4.6 The Concept of Redox Zinc Switch**

The tight control of free zinc ions is coordinated with their dual functions as either
a pro-oxidant or a pro-antioxidant. While zinc ions are redox neutral, zinc-cysteine
bonds in proteins generate redox-active coordination environments (Maret 2008).
Metallothionein (MT) is an intracellular chelator of zinc and it represents the first
example of a redox-active zinc protein, which changes its zinc load in response to the
cellular redox state. Under certain conditions linked to cellular zinc deficiency MT
may work as a donor of zinc ions to provide protection of vital enzymatic functions
during stress conditions.
The concept of «Redox Zinc Switch» has been presented by us previously in
detail (Korichneva 2006). The central position of zinc in the redox signaling network is built on its unique chemical nature. In proteins, zinc can bind mainly to
cysteine, histidine, aspartate, and glutamateresidues. Cysteines possess the unique
structural features that allow them to combine metal binding properties with catalytic
activity and extensive redox chemistry. The redox inert zinc creates a redox active
environment when it binds to a sulfur ligand. Within the zinc coordination center,
zinc ions potentially can modulate the reactivity of cysteine thiol groups towards
oxidation. Interdependency of these three aspects permits the redox regulation of
proteins, metal control of redox activity, and redox control of metal-based catalysis. The most important and extraordinary property of zinc–sulfur ligand interaction
is the release of zinc in an oxidative environment, converging redox signaling and
zinc metabolism. Cysteine-rich zinc binding protein domains are therefore able to
act as “redox zinc switches’ to sense the concentrations of both zinc and oxidants.

Therefore, unlike thiol oxidation/reduction, “redox zinc switches” are controlled by
zinc availability. Remarkably, until recently it was assumed that the redox inert zinc
protects thiolates from oxidation. However, studies suggest that a strong binding of
zinc enhances the redox sensitivity of thiolates (Maret and Vallee 1998.).
The unsurpassed study illustrating the mechanism of the “redox zinc switch”
operation was conducted in a relatively simple cell model of the bacterial chaperone
Hsp-33. Hsp33 contains a C-terminal zinc finger domain that modulates protein
activity by a redox-regulated, reversible hinge (Jakob et al. 2000.). In an oxidizing
microenvironment, thiols were converted to disulfide, zinc became uncoupled, and
the conformational unfolding of the protein produced an active enzyme. The reduced
form in the presence of zinc was inactive. The solution structure of a recombinant
61–residue protein containing zinc-binding domain of Hsp33 suggests that loss of
the bound zinc ions disrupts the well-folded structure, allowing the corresponding
cysteine residues to be oxidized (Barbirz et al. 2000.). This finding implies that the
redox response of zinc–cysteine clusters of Hsp33 is biphasic and emphasizes a
separate role for zinc in the redox control mechanism (Won et al. 2004).
This more than a decade-old fundamental study was recently substantiated by
another group that has presented corroborating data. In the theoretical model study
each reaction step was characterized by its Gibbs free energy barrier ( *�* G). It is predicted that the first reaction step consists in the oxidation of Cys 263 by H 2 O 2 which


-----

110 J. H. Beattie et al.

is by far the most reactive cysteine ( *�* G � 15.4 kcal mol [−] [1] ). The next two reaction
steps are the formation of the first S-S bridge between Cys 263 and Cys 266 ( *�* G �
13.6 kcal mol [−] [1] ) and the oxidation of Cys 231 by H 2 O 2 ( *�* G � 20.4 kcal mol [−] [1] ). It is
then shown that the formation of the second S-S bridge (Cys 231 -Cys 233 ) before the
zinc release is most unlikely ( *�* G � 34.8 kcal mol [−] [1] ). Instead, the release of zinc just
after the oxidation of the third cysteine (Cys 231 ) is shown to be thermodynamically
(dissociation Gibbs free energy *�* G d � 6.0 kcal mol [−] [1] ) and kinetically (reaction rate
constant *K* *d* ≈ 10 [6] s [−] [1] ) favored. This result is in good agreement with the experimental data on the oxidation mechanism of Hsp33 zinc center available to date (Enescu
et al. 2015).
Other types of redox zinc regulations have been discovered further demonstrating
the uniform nature of the concept. The universal minicircle sequence-binding protein
(UMSBP), a CCHC-type zinc finger protein, has been implicated with minicircle
replication initiation and kDNA segregation. Interactions of UMSBP with origin
sequences in vitro have been found to be affected by the protein’s redox state (Sela
et al. 2008).
Redox regulation is found to be exercised by a zinc finger (ZF) in a linker that
connects the catalytic domain of I-TevI to the DNA binding domain. Four cysteines
coordinate Zn [2+] in the ZF, which ensures that I-TevI cleaves its DNA substrate at a
fixed distance, 23–25 nucleotides upstream of the intron insertion site. The fidelity of
I-TevI cleavage is controlled by redox-responsive Zn [2+] cycling (Robbins et al. 2011).
The molecular players and targets of zinc homeostasis are summarised in Fig. 4.2.
###### **4.7 Pathophysiological Consequences of Zinc Deregulation**

Based on the chemical nature of zinc and its tight interaction with cellular molecules,
the pathologies developing as a consequence of zinc dyshomeostasis (zincopathies)
are closely connected to redox imbalance, oxidative stress and inflammation. ***4.7.1 Age Related Zinc Deficiency and Immunosenescence***

The immune system is the first candidate whose function depends on zinc. Indeed,
studies revealed important roles of zinc signals in lymphocyte development and in
innate and adaptive immune responses (Feske et al. 2015). The impact of zinc on
the immune system is well documented in the elderly, where zinc deficiency is a
common condition (Maywald and Rink 2015). It is still unclear if zinc deficiency
may be considered an integrative factor in immunosenescence, the decline of the
immune system with aging, but it is clearly demonstrated that both phenomena are
strictly related. Considering the pivotal role of zinc signalling in the function of all
cells of the immune system, it is not surprising that immunosenescence affects zinc
homeostasis (Lee et al. 2008; Wong et al. 2013).

**Fig. 4.2** Molecular players and targets of zinc homeostasis. Zn [2+] entry into cells and liberation from
intracellular compartments are mediated by the ZIP transporters, SLC39 family members. Cellular
Zn [2+] effluxanduptakebyintracellularcompartmentsisaccomplishedbyZnTtransporters,members
of the SLC30 gene family. Additional major routes of zinc entry from the extracellular space into
most cells are L-type calcium channels (LTCC) and TRP channels. An increase in intracellular
Zn [2+] plays a signaling role by decreasing protein phosphatases (PP) and increasing protein kinases
(PK). The expanded insert shows the underlying molecular mechanism of the Redox zinc switch:
oxydation of one or more cysteines in the zinc finger of Ser/Thr kinases in the regulatory domain
by reactive oxygen species (ROS) trigger the release of zinc ions with potential recapture upon
reduction, or sequestration by metallothionein (MT), which is induced by both ROS and Zn [2+]

There is evidence that plasma zinc levels and the capacity to maintain zinc homeostasis decline with aging as a consequence of age-related physio- and pathological
changes, which may be aggravated by poor nutritional intake and genetic predisposition (Giacconi et al. 2015, 2017a, b; Mocchegiani et al. 2008a, b; Prasad et al. 1993).
This condition, which may be described as “age-related zinc deficiency” (ARZD),
is thought to contribute to the status called inflamm-aging (Costarelli et al. 2010),
a component of immunosenescence consisting in a global reduction in the capacity
to cope with a variety of stressors and a concomitant progressive increase in proinflammatory status (Franceschi et al. 2000). ARZD can also contribute to important
changes in adaptive immunity including a shift of the T helper (Th) cell balance
towards a Th2 response, a non-specific pre-activation of T cells and a decreased
response to vaccination (Maywald and Rink 2015). Changes in innate immunity that
may be aggravated by ARZD comprise a decreased Natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity (Mocchegiani and Malavolta 2004) as well as impaired phagocytosis and


-----

112 J. H. Beattie et al.

maturation of dendritic cells (Stafford et al. 2013). Interestingly, the major clinical outcomes of ARZD consist in a higher incidence of infections, neoplasia and
autoimmune diseases, all of which have been described as common consequences
of immunosenescence itself. Hence, it is likely that ARZD and immunosenescence
may not be simply linked but that they rather constitute different aspect of the same
phenomenon.
###### ***4.7.2 Zinc Deregulation and Cardiovascular Diseases***

The association between zinc deficiency and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) has
been supported by a multitude of studies (Beattie and Kwun 2004; Little et al. 2010;
Beattie et al. 2012) and confirmed by various meta-analyses. A meta-analysis performed in 453 subjects from 27 case-control studies indicates that there is a significant
association between low serum zinc levels and heart failure (Yu et al. 2018). Another
meta-analysis performed in 2886 subjects from 41 case-control studies support that
zinc deficiency is associated with myocardial infarction (Liu et al. 2015). A metaanalysiswasalsoperformed(including14,515subjectsfrom24studies)toinvestigate
the effects of zinc supplementation on serum lipid levels. The results suggest that
zinc supplementation significantly reduced total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and
triglycerides with an overall favorable effect on plasma lipid parameters related to
the risk of atherosclerosis (Ranasinghe et al. 2015).
A definitive understanding of the cellular basis for the impact of low zinc status on
cardiovascular diseases has proved intractable over many years but recently, the true
complexity of zinc metabolism and its consequences on cellular function has been
appreciated. It is now clear that free zinc ion fluxes between extracellular, cellular
and intracellular compartments initiate cell signaling pathways having consequences
that are disproportionately larger than the changes in the free zinc ion concentration
and that may initiate events related to the onset and progression of CVD.
One of such mechanisms involves the Nitric Oxide (NO) pathway. Indeed, zinc
ions are necessary for the dimerization of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and
the production of NO (Zalewski et al. 2018), which plays an important role in the
protection against the onset and progression of cardiovascular disease. Moreover,
NO is able to displace zinc from MTs and can also mobilize zinc from other internal
stores, thus producing intracellular zinc signals that are responsible for a cascade of
events culminating in cytoprotection and vasodilation. This could be the reason why
various CVDs risk factors (such as aging, smoking and diabetes) are also known to
disturb zinc homeostasis.

Another mechanism related to zinc dyshomeostasis and CVDs could be the accumulation of endothelial senescent cells. Senescent endothelial cells are not only
present in human atherosclerotic lesions (Minamino et al. 2002), but they have been
described as crucial factors in promoting the pathology (Childs et al. 2016; Fyhrquist
et al. 2013). Both transgenic and pharmacological approaches to clear senescent
cells have provided preclinical evidence that selective ablation of these cells can


-----

4 Zinc 113

contribute to ameliorate the pathological profile (Childs et al. 2016). The influence
of zinc homeostasis on endothelial cell senescence appears as an important mechanism to explain the molecular basis of the association between zinc dyshomeostasis,
zinc deficiency and atherosclerosis. Indeed, chronic stimulation with zinc “in vitro” (which may eventually correspond “in vivo” to a repeated mobilization of free
zinc ions by chronic oxidative stress) promotes the entry of endothelial cells into
senescence (Malavolta et al. 2017). Similarly, Angiotensin II induces senescence in
vascular smooth muscle cells by reducing the zinc exporters ZnT3 and ZnT10 and
increasing intracellular zinc (Patrushev et al. 2012;). Importantly, senescent endothelial cells show disrupted zinc homeostasis, which may be related to the susceptibility
of senescent cells to undergo cell death (Malavolta et al. 2017a). Indeed, “in vitro”
zinc depletion leads to a preferential apoptosis in young replicating cells rather than in
senescent endothelial cells, thus suggesting a potential mechanism of accumulation
of senescent cells during zinc deficiency.
The increased apoptosis of replicating cells in condition of zinc deficiency could
be related to the production of a novel discovered zinc-regulated factor (Ou et al.
2013). Primary rat vascular smooth muscle cells treated with plasma from zincdeficient rats (<1 mg Zn/kg) display increased apoptosis (Allen-Redpath et al. 2013)
and changes in gene expression that are mediated by a low-molecular-weight (∼2kDa) zinc-regulated humoral factor, whose activity is reversed by repletion of zinc
(Ou et al. 2013). Hence, both apoptosis of normal endothelial and vascular cells as
well as increased resistance to apoptosis of senescent endothelial cells may contribute
to the development of the pathology during zinc deficiency.
Moreover, zinc is a wound-healing agent, and we believe it may support survival
of cardiac stem cells that are essential components of cardiac healing (Little et al.
2010). Last but not least there is convincing evidence that zinc deregulation can
reduce antioxidant defense, in particular those provided by MTs, thus contributing
to the development of diabetes (as described in details in the next chapter), which is
a major risk factor in CVD.
Understanding of these mechanisms will lead to the development of new therapeutic modalities for the prevention and treatment of cardiac disorders that will be
based on zinc manipulations.
###### ***4.7.3 Zinc Deregulation and Diabetes***

Zinc is particularly important in diabetes research based on its physiological role
in insulin-receptor signal transduction (Haase and Maret 2005) and insulin storage
and secretion (Figlewicz et al. 1984). Deregulated zinc homeostasis is commonly
observed in diabetes mellitus (DM2) and its complications (Giacconi et al. 2017a,
b) and genome association studies clearly demonstrate the association of a polymorphism in the coding region of SLC30A8 (ZnT-8) gene [rs13266634; arginine
(Arg)/tryptophan (Trp) 325 ; from herein Arg325Trp] with the susceptibility to DM2
(Saxena et al. 2007; Zeggini et al. 2007; Fan et al. 2016). The ZnT-8 was initially


-----

114 J. H. Beattie et al.

described as a β-cell-specific transporter specialized in the transport of zinc into the
insulin secretory granules (Chimienti et al. 2004), but further studies have shown
that it is also expressed in peripheral blood lymphocytes, in subcutaneous fat tissue, and in pancreatic α-cells, where its overexpression reduces glucagon secretion
(Giacconi et al. 2017a, b). The biochemical consequences of the Arg325Trp SNP are
under intensive investigation. The first functional studies performed in ZnT-8 KO
mice and cells transfected with low- and high- risk alleles suggested that the ZnT8 Arg risk allele could codify for a poorly active ZnT-8 transporter, which might
be responsible for a lower accumulation of zinc into β-cell granules than the Trp
allele (Nicolson et al. 2009). However, subsequent studies performed in the human
embryonic kidney cells 293 (HEK293 cells) demonstrated that Arg-325 variant is
more active than theTrp-325 and shows accelerated zinc transport kinetics (Merriman et al. 2016). This finding is confirmed by further functional and genetic findings
showing that rare loss-of-function mutations in ZnT-8 may exert beneficial effects
on glucose metabolism by increasing the capacity of β-cells to secrete insulin under
hyperglycemic conditions (Kleiner et al. 2018) and are associated with reduced DM2
risk in humans (Flannick et al. 2014). Other functional consequences of the Arg risk
allele include an impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Kim et al. 2011) and
increased hepatic insulin clearance (Tamaki et al. 2013), both of which are consistent
with the involvement of this SNP in the development of D2 M.
ZnT-8 is also a major target of autoimmunity in type 1 diabetes as the SLC30A8
Arg325Trp variant is an important determinant of autoantibody specificity (Kawasaki
et al. 2011).
Experimental and clinical studies also suggest that zinc deficiency might predispose diabetes mellitus and its cardiovascular complications (Mocchegiani et al.
2008a, b). A meta-analysis performed from 52 studies (n � 20,183 diabetic patients)
confirm that DM2 is characterized by low zinc status accompanied by increased copper (Sanjeevi et al. 2018). Interestingly an imbalance of copper to zinc ratio is also
associated with CVDs in the eldery (Malavolta et al. 2010).
It has been proposed that zinc deficiency might predispose to diabetes and its renal
and cardiovascular complications by promoting oxidative stress and inflammation
(Zhang et al. 2012; Mylroie et al. 2015; Shen et al. 2008).
In vitro studies performed on endothelial cells demonstrate that zinc depletion
cause an increase of oxidative stress markers and an increased activity of NF-kB
with the concomitant upregulation of E-selectin and monocyte adhesion (Shen et al.
2008). Conversely, zinc treatment can counteract advanced glycated end products
(AGEs)-mediated endothelial dysfunction, enhances eNOS activity, and downregulate NF- kB activation (Zhuang et al. 2012). Other experiments “in vitro” have shown
the capacity of zinc to regulate the synthesis of glutathione, to promote the nuclear
factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2(Nrf2)-mediated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) induction and to enhancing the resistance to inflammation and apoptosis of endothelial
cells (Mylroie et al 2015). Nrf2 is a crucial transcription factor in the antioxidant
response and promotes the expression of several proteins and enzymes involved in
detoxificationandantioxidant response, includingMTs (Fujieet al. 2016) andvarious
zinc transporter genes (e.g., ZnT-1, ZnT-3, ZnT-6, ZnT-10, and ZIP-3) (Ishida et al.


-----

2016). These results further confirm the existence of a tight relationship between Zn
homeostasis and the antioxidant response, thus suggesting that a strict regulation of
Zn homeostasis is relevant to prevent vascular damage in DM2. It is likely that MT
expression induced by zinc is one of the major protective factors in diabetes. Indeed,
increased pancreatic MT expression induced by zinc supplementation was shown
to prevent diabetes induced by streptozotocin (Ohly et al. 2000). Moreover, several studies using transgenic technology showed that ubiquitous and tissue-specific
MT overexpression can successfully ameliorate diabetic hyperglycemia and CVDs
(Giacconi et al. 2018). Other mechanisms, including accumulation of senescent cells,
increased apoptosis and eNOS modulation that may be involved in the pathogenesis
and consequences of DM2 by zinc deficiency, have been already described in the
previous chapter focused on CVDs. Other findings, already extensively reviewed
(Giacconi et al. 2018), also support a role for additional zinc transporters (e.g. ZIP2)
in the susceptibility to DM2 and in the response to zinc supplementation.
Inconclusion,thereiswidespreadsupportforapathogenicroleofderegulatedzinc
homeostasis in DM2 which may be useful for the development of novel therapeutic
intervention in DM2 or to delay or prevent its cardiovascular complications.
###### ***4.7.4 Zinc Deregulation and Neurodegenerative Diseases***

The influence of zinc homeostasis in the pathogenesis, prevention and treatment
of age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s diseases (AD) and
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most discussed topics in zinc research. In
addition to its considerable role in the stress response and in the functionality of
zinc-dependent enzymes contributing to maintaining brain compensatory capacity,
zinc may display neuromodulatory activity at excitatory synapses (Mocchegiani et al.
2005; Frederickson et al. 2005). In normal physiological conditions, zinc released
from the synaptic vesicles modulates post-synaptic receptors. Synaptically released
zinc can modulate the activity of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, αamino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA) glutamate receptors,
GABAA and glycine inotropic receptors (Smart et al. 2004). However, in presence
of pathological conditions, such as stroke, epilepsy and brain injury it has been
documented that an excessive influx of zinc ions into the post-synaptic neurons promotes neuronal death and tissue damage (Szewczyk 2013). Indeed, when mature
cortical cell cultures are exposed to several hundred micromolar concentrations of
zinc (comparable to those measured “in vivo” during pathological conditions), this
essential trace element can act as a potent neurotoxin (Choi et al. 1988). Conversely,
treatment with EDTA, a membrane-impermeable chelator of zinc (and other cations
except for calcium), reduces the influx of zinc and protect hippocampal neurons by
death following transient global ischemia (Calderone et al. 2004). Hence, the regulation of zinc homeostasis in the central nervous system (CNS) is extremely critical
for normal brain function. It is thus not surprising that deregulated zinc homeostasis
has been implicated in a multitude of neurodegenerative diseases including AD, PD,


-----

116 J. H. Beattie et al.

depression, schizophrenia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The regulation
of zinc homeostasis in the brain is under the control of ubiquitous and tissue specific
MTs, ZnT and ZIP transporters. In this context, the brain specific MT isoform (MT3)
seems to be particularly affected by aging (showing a higher increase in aging rats
compared to the other isoforms) (Scudiero et al. 2017) and it is a likely candidate to
play a role in some age-related neurodegenerative diseases. However, there is currently no clear association of MT3 dysfunction with a specific neurodegenerative
disease and the transgenic mouse model of AD Tg2576 shows approximately a 30%
decrease of MT3 (normalized to the total protein) in the extracts of whole brain
homogenates compared to age-matched non-transgenic mice (Martin et al. 2006).
Regarding AD, studies focused on plasma levels of zinc have reported contrasting
results (Mocchegiani and Malavolta 2007), but a recent work performed in a large
Australian cohort demonstrate that there is no significant difference in serum zinc
among healthy controls (HC), mildly cognitively impaired (MCI) or AD subjects
(Rembach et al. 2014). Although serum zinc does not seem to be involved in the
pathology, there is evidence that zinc dyshomeostasis within the context of neuronal death is associated with major human neurological disorders including AD. A
distinctive feature of AD is the abnormal accumulation of amyloid plaques in the
neocortex. The exceptional colocalization of amyloid plaques with ZnT-3 expression
and zinc in the glutamatergic synapses of the neocortex and the capacity of zinc to
induce aggregation of Amyloid-β into amyloid precipitates (Bush et al. 1994) form
a strong rationale for the zinc-dyshomeostasis pathological hypothesis of AD (Sensi
et al. 2011). Moreover, it has been reported that the total concentration of zinc in
the cortex of AD brain can rise during the pathology (Religa et al. 2006). A modern interpretation of the zinc-amyloid hypothesis suggest that amyloid plaques may
“trap” zinc thus inducing neuronal depletion of this trace element with consequent
cognitive and memory loss. Indeed, in experimental models (ZnT-3 KO mice) of
cognitive impairment and experimental mice models of AD, treatment with zinc
ionophores (compounds able to mobilize zinc and replenish zinc deficient cells),
such as clioquinol or PTB2, may reverse part of the functional defects in memory
loss and cognitive performances (Deshpande et al. 2009; Adlard et al. 2008). It is not
surprising that these compounds have been used in clinical trials as a potential cure
for AD. While the clinical trials with clioquinol have been halted due to serious side
effects, those with PTB2 have produced promising results. In particular, a IIa doubleblind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial found that the 250 mg dose of PBT2 was
well-tolerated, significantly lowered cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid-β42 and
improved cognition measured by a Neuro-psychological Test Battery (NTB) within
12 weeks of treatment in patients with AD (Faux et al. 2010). An important aspect
of the zinc-dyshomeostasis hypothesis of AD is to understand why zinc can interacts
withamyloid-β onlyatadvancedage.Onehypothesisisthatthisispromotedbyraised
extracellular zinc levels with aging (Sensi et al. 2011). This hypothesis could be of
particular relevance considering that MTs, the major proteins involved in buffering
of zinc, have been reported to decrease in very advanced age (despite their increase
in old age) (Mocchegiani et al. 2005). This phenomenon may be related to cellular
senescence (Malavolta et al. 2016) or other epigenetic mechanisms (Gabbianelli and

Malavolta 2018) that reflect human aging. The hypothesis that cellular senescence
can contribute to zinc dyshomeostasis and its pathological consequences for the
aging brain find further support from recent advances in the pathogenic mechanisms
of PD. PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after AD and is
characterized by α-synuclein aggregation and death of dopaminergic neurons in the
substantia nigra. Interestingly, zinc induces dopaminergic neurodegeneration resulting in PD phenotype in experimental models (Kumar et al. 2012) and postmortem
studies show an increased zinc accumulation in dopaminergic neurons of PD patients
(Dexter et al. 1989). This finding is particular important as excess of extracellular
zinc has been shown to induce cellular senescence (Malavolta et al. 2014, 2017a)
and there is substantial evidence for an implication of cellular senescence in PD
(Chinta et al. 2013). The contribution of cellular senescence in PD pathology can
explain the positive results obtained by treatment with piperlongumine in rotenoneinduced Parkinson disease models. In these models, piperlongumine was shown to
attenuate motor deficits in mice and prevent the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the
substantia nigra (Liu et al. 2018a). While the authors did not explore the involvement of cellular senescence, they showed that pipelongumine can be considered
among the compounds named senolytics, e.g. compunds that can selectively eliminate senescent cells (Liu et al. 2018b). Hence it can be speculated that the protective
effect of piperlongumine in these models of PD could be related to a removal of
senescent cells. Further studies addressing zinc homeostasis in experimental models
treated with senolytics would be useful to understand the relationship between zinc
dyshomeostasis and cellular senescence.
###### ***4.7.5 Zinc Deregulation and Cancer***

Zinc and zinc signaling are now recognized as important targets in the treatment of
cancer (Ziliotto et al. 2018). Zinc ions can act as a second messenger by inhibiting
a multitude of tyrosine phosphatases involved in a cascade of signals known to
promote aberrant cancer growth. Alteration of zinc transporters and MTs which can
be observed in most cancer cells, in particular in pancreatic, prostate and breast
cancer cells, affect the normal function of these signaling pathways (Bafaro et al.
2017). For example, in pancreatic cancer an increase in ZIP4 mRNA levels has been
shown (Li et al. 2007) while most of the other zinc importers and exporters have
been found to be downregulated (Yang et al. 2013). However, a high variability in
zinc transporter expression has been reported in different pancreatic cancer tissues
and cell lines.

In prostate cancer there is strong evidence for an involvement of zinc deregulation
in the pathology. The human prostate contains 3- to 15-fold higher zinc than any other
soft tissue, with a concentration raising up to 1500 μM in prostate epithelial cells
(Costello and Franklin 2016). This high concentration of zinc is required to (1) inhibit
the mitochondrial aconitase, which catalyze the oxidation of citrate in isocitrate,
resulting in accumulation of citrate, and (2) to cause the temporary inactivity of

prostatic tissue kallikreins, a subgroup of serine proteases including prostate-specific
antigen (PSA) that are responsible for regulating semen liquefaction (Verze et al.
2016). Prostate cancer is frequently characterized by an early and marked decline
in the concentration of zinc (Costello and Franklin 2006) as a result of reduced
levels of ZIP1 and other zinc importers (e.g. ZIP2, ZIP3 and ZIP4) (Verze et al.
2016). The absence of zinc activates an Akt-p21signaling pathway, which results
in the phosphorylation of p21 and its retention in the cytoplasm with subsequent
promotion of cell proliferation (Han et al. 2009).
Zinc plays an important role in normal mammary gland function; thus, it is not
surprising to find that nutritional zinc deficiency is a risk factor in the development
of breast cancer (McCormick et al. 2014). However, in contrast to prostate cancer
there is evidence that breast cancer is characterized by higher zinc levels compared
with normal breast tissue (Gumulec et al. 2014). Zinc dyshomeostasis characterizes
most types of breast cancer cells, but the mechanisms involved in this dyshomeostasis are different for triple negative, HER2 positive and estrogen receptor positive
tumors. Triple negative breast cancer expresses high levels of MTs, ZIP4, ZIP10 and
ZIP14 and lower levels of ZIP6, ZIP9 and ZIP11 compared to normal tissues (Speers
et al. 2017). Estrogen positive breast cancers express high levels of ZIP6 and ZIP8
(Chandler et al. 2016). Moreover, many patients with estrogen positive breast cancer treated with tamoxifen experience cancer relapse due to a drug resistance likely
related to further alterations in zinc dyshomeostasis. Indeed, tamoxifen resistant cancer cells display an increase of intracellular zinc compared to non-resistant cells that
is mediated by high levels of ZIP7 (Taylor et al. 2008). Removal of ZIP7 also blocks
the activation of HER2. Moreover, HER2 positive breast cancer cells also display
increased zinc levels. The raised concentration of zinc in these cells mediates the

activation of the ERK and Akt kinase signaling pathways and the subsequent cascade of events culminating in cell proliferation and migration (Pisano et al. 2017).
In conclusion, understanding cellular zinc homeostasis and signaling in cancer cells
appears a promising strategy for the development of new drug targets to be used in
the fight against cancer.
###### ***4.7.6 Zinc Deregulation and Other Age-Related Diseases***

Zinc deficiency and deregulation are related to many other diseases associated with
aging. Low serum micronutrient concentrations, including zinc, are an independent
risk factors for frailty among disabled older women, and the risk of frailty increases
withthenumberofmicronutrientdeficiencies(Sembaetal. 2006).AhighserumCuto
Zn ratio correlates with frailty, impairments in bone density, physical performance
and overall mortality in the elderly (Gaier et al. 2012; Mocchegiani et al. 2012;
Malavolta et al. 2010). Zinc seems also an important nutrient to prevent or treat
sarcopenia, as pointed out in a systematic review considering the role of various
mineral (van Dronkelaar et al. 2018). These data suggest that zinc supplementation
may be useful to ameliorate the decline of physical performance in the elderly and to


-----

prevent frailty. However, caution must be taken in supplementation studies performed
in elderly patients, especially in those with kidney dysfunction. Indeed, a large US
population-based cross-sectional study found an association with high zinc intake
and increased risk of kidney stone disease (Tang et al. 2012).
Zinc deregulation has been also associated with various respiratory diseases,
in particular with cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD). CF is caused by genetic mutation of a chloride ion channel, the cystic
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), while COPD is related to
alterations of the epithelial sodium ion channel (ENaC). Both pathologies are characterized by chronic airway inflammation and obstruction, accompanied by exaggerated mucus retention and fluid imbalance. Experiments “in vitro” with patients
derived cell lines, have demonstrated that the alterations of ENaC and CFTR that
characterize BPCO and CF, respectively, induced a reduction of a specific zinc transporters (ZIP2), causing zinc deficiency in lung epithelial cells (Kamei et al. 2018).
In turn, the zinc deficient status activates a cascade of events that culminate in the
excessive production of mucus-producing genes (e.g. MUC5AC) in the lungs. These
findings establish a clear mechanistic link between COPD, CF, the overproduction
of mucus, and zinc deregulation in epithelial cells. While this study offers new therapeutic opportunities, it is important to remark that the defects could not be corrected
by a simple zinc supplementation, as the defects arise by proteins involved in the
control of zinc homeostasis rather than in a nutritional imbalance.
###### **4.8 Zinc and Longevity from Yeasts and Invertebrates** **to Humans**

Availabledataonthebiologyofzincpointsoutitsstronginterplaywiththeinsulinand
insulin growth factor (IIS) pathway (Malavolta et al. 2017b) Experimental manipulations that upregulate the IIS pathway promote aging, while those that downregulate
these pathways extend life span and delay the onset of age-related pathologies.
Experimental models of zinc deficiency and supplementation suggest that zinc
promotes the IIS pathways, thus suggesting a pro-aging role which appears to be
confirmed by lifespan studies performed in animal models (Malavolta et al. 2017b).
One of the first observation was made from studies on the growth of yeasts exposed
to zinc (Steenbergen et al. 1969). Yeast growth was optimal in a medium containing
1 μM Zn, while the presence of additional Zn (from 10 to 100 μM) induced a dosedependent reduction in the lifespan. Similar findings were replicated in trematodes
(cercariae and schistosomules of Schistosoma mansoni) as the longevity of the parasites appears to be inversely proportional to the zinc concentration of the medium
(from 0.05 to 5 mM) (Asch and Dresden 1977). In nematodes, the addition of zinc
in the medium (from 200 μM up to 500 μM) decreases dose dependently the mean
and maximal lifespan, while zinc deprivation (addition of the zinc chelator TPEN
from 50 μM up to 200 μM) exerts a beneficial effect (Kumar et al. 2016). The most


-----

important finding of this study is that these results were observed only when zinc
treatment was performed during early development while the same treatment performed after five days of adulthood did not affect the lifespan of the worms. The
negative effects of zinc on lifespan were mainly mediated by daf16, a downstream
target of the IIS pathway and ortholog of the FOXO family of transcription factors
in humans. These finding indicate that the negative effects of zinc on longevity are
not simply a matter of toxicity, but are likely due to their effects on signaling pathways that promote growth and development. Zinc supplementation also induces a
reduction of lifespan in flies, but exerts a beneficial effect (measured as an extension
of 12 days of lifespan) in the parkin mutant flies (Saini and Schaffner 2010).
However, transcript levels of the metallothionein MtnB are over-expressed in
parkin mutants and MtnB is further increased (24 fold) by zinc supplementation,
thus suggesting a different regulation of zinc homeostasis in these mutant flies compared to wild-type flies. It is likely that these mutant flies display a general zinc
dyshomeostasis that is corrected by zinc supplementation.
These results are very similar to those obtained in a mouse model of acrodermatitis
enteropathica (a human genetic disease of acute zinc deficiency) generated by a
conditional knockout of ZIP4. Indeed, in this mutant mouse, high doses of zinc
supplementation (250 mg/L in drinking water) exert a strong positive beneficial
effect on the lifespan. (Geiser et al. 2012).
Zinc supplementation in normal mice have produced contrasting results. An
antioxidant mixture including 5 mg/kg of elemental zinc in the form of gluconate
induced a 10–16% increase in the lifespan of C57BL/6 mice when starting the diet at
2 and 9 months of age, but not when starting at 16 and 23 months of age (Bezlepkin
et al. 1996). Zinc treatment (22 mg/L in drinking water) starting at age of 18 months
in Balb/c mice housed in non-SPF conditions induced a median lifespan extension
(from 27 to approximately 30 months) with an increase in 10% of maximal lifespan (from 30 to 33 months) (Mocchegiani et al. 1998). However, a detailed survival
study in the long living MT1 overexpressing mice and in the respective controls
(C57BL/6 J) under supplementation with a high dose of Zn (380 mg/L) demonstrated no impact on the overall survival (as observed by Kaplan-Meier analys) but
a 14% in the S0 parameter of the Piantanelli mathematical model of survivorship
(Malavolta et al. 2012), thus suggesting that zinc treatment increased the variability
of the response in the mice.
Hence,itmightbehypothesizedthatstochasticandmicroenvironmentalvariations
regarding zinc homeostatic mechanisms, drinking behaviors of mice, subclinical
diseases and infections or other microenvironmental factors related to the non-SPF

conditions may affect the individual outcome of zinc supplementation.
In conclusion there is reasonable support to the idea that zinc supplementation
early in life, in absence of a well-defined zinc deficiency or zinc dyshomeostasis,
may promote growth and development but may negatively affect longevity. This is
likely due to the impact of Zn on the IIS signaling pathway which has a well-defined
antagonistic pleiotropic function in aging. Conversely, Zn treatment in adult and old
organisms seems not to have mean negative effects on lifespan, but the treatment may
induce an increased heterogeneity and likely a different response within the same

experimental population. Part of this heterogeneity may be attributed to differences
in the machinery that regulates zinc homeostasis and thus zinc can display beneficial
effects in particular conditions related to deregulated zinc homeostasis. In this case,
restoring a normal zinc homeostasis through pharmacological or genetic intervention could be an interesting approach, but the complexity of the zinc homeostatic
machinery makes it difficult to predict the overall outcome.
For example, the mutant drosophila with a defective MTF-1 (the sensor of free
zinc in the cell that activates zinc dependent transcription) display shortened lifespan,
whereas MTF-1 overexpression results in resistant flies with prolonged longevity on
iron or cadmium-supplemented media but shortened life-span on zinc-supplemented
medium (Bahadorani et al. 2010).
A relatively clear picture seems to arise from genetic manipulation of MTs. A
longevity phenotype has been clearly shown in MT transgenic mice that overexpress
the MT-1 isoform (MT1-tg) on a C57BL/6 J genetic background (Malavolta et al.
2012), as well as in cardiac-specific MT transgenic mice that overexpress the human
MT2 isoform on an FVB background (Yang et al. 2006), while MT knockout mice in
the 129/Sv genetic background have a shorter mean and median lifespan compared
to the wild type (Kadota et al. 2015). Regarding humans, a polymorphism in the
MT1a gene coding region is reported to be associated with longevity (Cipriano et al.
2006) and that MTs can be involved in the tight control of zinc homeostasis observed
in the cells from centenarian offspring (Giacconi et al. 2018). Most importantly, we
have recently observed that the number of MT genes in the genome, as well as MT
mRNA expression (retrieved from public databases) is associated with the longevity
of mammalian species even after correcting for age at sampling, body mass and
phylogeny (Pabis and Malavolta, unpublished results).
###### **4.9 Conclusions and Perspective**

The relationship between Zn homeostasis, aging and health appears to be very
complex and involves direct interactions (e.g. binding to target proteins or transport defects, e.g. zinc deficiency) as well as indirect interactions (e.g. mediated by
oxidative stress, inflammation or cellular senescence) that can result in pathological consequences. Current evidence suggests that zinc dyshomeostasis is involved
in immunosenescence, CVDs, neurodegenerative diseases, DM2, cancer, frailty and
COPD and that proteins regulating zinc homeostasis can promote longevity. To better understand the molecular mechanisms and pathways that lead to imbalance in
zinc both on the levels of individual cells and whole organisms, simple models like
yeast or flies will help accelerate knowledge acquisition and discovery. The exponential development of molecular probes to assess ionic zinc fluctuations combined
with high resolution imaging using synchrotron x-ray fluorescence techniques with
help in this task. Future multidisciplinary research by biologists and chemists should
yield information on genetic- and epigenetic-based changes in protein players and

their contribution to zinc dyshomeostasis. This will form the basis for prevention
and supplemental therapies of age-related diseases.

##### **Chapter 5**
#### **Chromium in Health and Longevity**

**Ruslana Iskra and Halyna Antonyak**

**Abstract** Trivalent chromium is essential to normal carbohydrate, lipid and protein
metabolism. Chromium is biologically active as part of an oligopeptide—chromodulin—potentiating the effect of insulin by facilitating insulin binding to receptors
at the cell surface. With chromium acting as a cofactor of insulin, Cr activity in
the organism is parallel to insulin functions. Cr(III) can help enhance the role of
insulin, the critical hormone that controls blood sugar and helps bring glucose into
cells where it’s used for bodily energy. Chromium deficiency has been suggested
to lead to symptoms associated with adult-onset diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and these supplements have recently found potential as therapeutic agents in
the treatment of adultonset diabetes. Cr(VI) is one of the few carcinogenic metals
that directly reacts with DNA, forming adducts, and inducing mutations. The results
of a wide range of studies indicate that the CpG1 methylation level of p16 could
be used as a biomarker of epigenetic effect caused by Cr(VI) treatment, which can
enhance cell damage by regulating its expression or affecting some transcription factors to combine with their DNA strand sites. In addition, it is difficult to distinguish
between the effects caused by chromium(VI) and those caused by chromium(III)
since chromium(VI) is rapidly reduced to chromium(III) after penetration of biological membranes and in the gastric environment. In addition to its role in glucose
and lipid metabolism, chromium also functions as an antioxidant. Chromium(III)
protects organism from oxidative stress associated with reactive oxygen species.
These ROS extremely reactive chemical molecules, are considered toxic to produce
oxidative damage to various cellular components which causes cellular dysfunction
that accompanies aging process. The antiaging effect of chromium is undoubtedly
related to the effect of chromium on insulin action. Chromium in a utilizable form,
like dietary restriction, prevents hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, protein glycation
and extends life span. Because the body’s ability to control blood glucose is critical

to many life functions, a consequence of Cr supplementation can be improved health
and reproductive outcomes as well as improved survival rate or life span.
##### Keywords Chromium(III) · Absorption · Viological function · Metabolism Toxicity · Diabetes mellitus · Mortality · Life span
###### **5.1 Introduction**

Chromium is a naturally occurring element found in animals, plants, rocks, and soil
and in volcanic dust and gases. Chromium has oxidation states (or “valence states”)
ranging from chromium(-II) to chromium(VI). Chromium compounds are stable in
the trivalent (III) state and occur in nature in this state in ores, such as ferrochromite.
The hexavalent (VI) form is the second-most stable state. However, chromium(VI)
rarely occurs naturally, but is usually produced from anthropogenic sources (EPA
1984).
Chromium levels in soil vary according to area and the degree of contamination
from anthropogenic chromium sources. Chromium(VI) in soil can be rapidly reduced
to chromium(III) by organic matter.
Cr(VI) is a strong oxidant—in the form of chromates and dichromates it penetrates
biological membranes and reacts with cell contents, proteins or nucleic acids, while
being reduced to Cr(III).
In contrast, Cr(III) is the most stable form in biological systems (Cohen et al.
1993; Losi et al. 1994) it does not penetrate biological membranes easily, and it
appears that the transport of specific chromium compounds is strictly regulated by
the organism. Cr(III) ion has a strong tendency to form coordination compounds with
a very slow reaction rate (Mertz 1992).
That slow rate suggests that chromium would exert a structural function rather
than an active site in an enzyme, which may explain that no chromium-containing
enzymes have been identified (Mertz 1992). **5.2 Chromium Absorption, Blood Transport and Excretion**

The total amount of Cr in the human body ranges between 0.4 and 6 mg. Daily intake
strongly depends upon feed levels, and is usually approximately 15–200 μg, but may
be as high as 1 mg.
Chromium is present in the diet both as the inorganic form and organic complexes. The rate of absorption of inorganic Cr is low, from 0.4–3%, and is a function
of daily dose supplied. According to Anderson (1987) ingestion of daily dose of
10 μg, up to 2% is absorbed, while at the dose of 40 μg, absorption decreases to
0.5%, and at the higher doses, it remains constant at 0.4%. The absorption of Cr from
CrCl3 and acetate (Mertz 1975) is approx. 0.5%, and approx. 40% for chromium

trisacetylacetonate in rats (Anderson 1987). Chromium chloride, chromium pinacolinate and chromium polynicotinate are the most common supplemental sources
available. Although absorption of chromium picolinate is lower than 4%, it is still significantly greater than that of chromium chloride (Mertz 1975). There is also a report
claiming that niacin-bound chromium was 672% better absorbed than chromium
chloride and 311% better than chromium picolinate (Krejpcio 2001; Madhavi et al.
2013).
The absorption of Cr is facilitated by certain amino acids, such as histidine, which
chelates Cr and prevents the precipitation of Cr at the basic pH in the small intestine
(Mertz 1969; Mertz and Roginski 1971). Nicotnic acid and ascorbic acid are required
for Cr absorption and act in synergy with this element. Ascorbic acid has been
reported to enhance chromium transport or absorption in animals (Dowling et al.
1990) and humans (Mertz and Roginski 1971).
Compared with simple sugars such as glucose, fructose and sucrose, starch
increased tissue chromium in mice (Dowling et al. 1990). Metals can form complexes or compete with Cr and modify its absorption. For example: Zn, V and Fe
supplementation decreased the absorption of Cr (Chen et al. 1973). On the other hand,
absorption of 51Cr was elevated in Zn-deficient rats and was reduced by zinc supplementation (Hahn and Evans 1975). Phytates significantly decrease the absorption
of Cr in the intestines of rats, whereas oxalate act inversely (Chen et al. 1973).
Chromium is absorbed in the intestinal mucosa. In rats the middle section of the

small intestine was the most active segment for Cr absorption, followed by the illeum
and duodenum (Chen et al. 1973). In humans, the site of absorption also includes the
jejunum (Doisy et al. 1976). The mechanism responsible for the intestinal absorption
of Cr is not known.

Absorbed Cr circulates in blood bound to the β-globulin plasma fraction and is
transported to tissues bound to transferrin or other complexes at the physiological
concentration.

Trivalent Cr tends to accumulate in epidermal tissues (hair etc.) and in bones,
liver, kidney, spleen, lungs and the large intestine. Accumulation in other tissues,
especially muscles, seems to be strictly limited or non-existent (Wallach 1985). The
placenta is the organ with the highest chromium amounts.
The Cr reserve relative to the body weight is higher in newborn children compared
with adults (Dubois and Belleville 1991). The concentration of Cr in the lungs, aorta,
heart and spleen decreases during the first months of life, whereas the liver and
kidneys maintain their neonatal level up to the age of 10 years.
Absorbed Cr is excreted principally in the urine, and in small quantities in the
hair, sweat and bile. The major route of elimination after absorption is faecal. Urinary
excretion is the major route of elimination of Cr from the body, is a good reflection
of the ingestion, but not necessarily of body status (Anderson et al. 1983).

###### **5.3 Biological Function of Chromium**

The biological function of chromium is not fully known yet. It is postulated that
chromium interacts with the thyroid metabolism in humans. Binding of Cr(III) with
nucleic acids has been found to stimulate the DNA-dependant RNA synthesis (Mertz
1992). The third interaction of Cr(III) is with the hormone insulin and its receptors.
This suggests that Cr(III) acts with insulin on the first step in the metabolism of sugar
entry into the cell, and facilitates the interaction of insulin with its receptor on the
cell surface.

Older research (Schwarz and Mertz 1957, 1959) associated Cr activity in animal
organisms with a substance called the glucose tolerance factor (GTF), whose active
substance is Cr. Further research into the GTF however revealed that GTF activity
does not correlate with Cr content (Simonoff et al. 1992; Lindemann et al. 2009).
According to the latest research, GTF activity is not dependent on a unique Cr compound and the complexation of Cr by yeast is more likely simple ligand substitution
by components in the growth medium. Attention has thus recently turned to chromodulin and it has been proposed that GTF is merely a decomposition product of this
true biologically active form of chromium. In the 1980s, Wada et al. (1983) reported
they had isolated a chromium-binding oligopeptide called the low-molecular-weight
chromium binding substance—LMWCr or chromodulin. The molecular weight of
the oligopeptide is ~1500 Da and it is formed by 4 types of amino-acid residues
(glycine, cysteine, glutamate and aspartate). Despite its low molecular weight, it
binds 4 equivalents of chromic ions in a complex of four nuclei. This oligopeptide
has been isolated and purified from rabbit liver (Yamamoto et al. 1987), pig kidney
(Sumrall and Vincent 1997), cattle kidney (Davis and Vincent 1997b) and colostrum
(Yamamoto et al. 1983), dog liver (Wada et al. 1983) and isolated from mouse and
rat kidneys (Yamamoto et al. 1983). Chromodulin is present in mammals; no paper
dealing with isolation of this oligopeptide in other animal species has been published
yet. The assumed mechanism for the action of chromodulin has been described by
Vincent (2000; Fig. 5.1). Increased glucose concentration leads to the fast release
of insulin into blood. Insulin binds to an external α subunit of the transmembrane

protein insulin receptor, causing its conformation change. The receptor autophosphorylates tyrosine residues on the internal portion of its β subunit, turning the receptor
into an active kinase. Chromodulin is stored in its apo-form (apochromodulin) in the
cytosol (Yamamoto et al. 1989) and the nucleus of insulinsensitive cells. Increases in
plasma insulin concentrations have been found to result in a movement of chromium
from the blood to insulin-dependent cells (Morris et al. 1993a, b). Due to the high
Cr ion binding constant of apochromodulin (K ≈ 1021) (Sun et al. 2000), four Cr [3+]

are bound upon the entry of Cr into the cell, producing holochromodium (i.e. Cr4chromodulin). The newly formed compound is bound to insulin-stimulated receptors,
helps maintain their active conformation and enhances insulin signalling. When the
level of insulin in blood decreases and receptor signalling must be interrupted chromodulin is eliminated from the cells. The high Cr-binding constant suggests that Cr
might not be released from chromodulin to regenerate the apo form as formation of

the apo-oligopepetide from holochromodulin requires chelating agent activity at a
low pH and increased the temperature, this is not possible if physiological conditions
are to be preserved (Davis and Vincent 1997a). Loss of chromodulin from cells is
consistent with increased Cr concentration in urine following the intake of carbohydrates (Anderson et al. 1982; Lindemann et al. 2009); chromodulin seems to be the
main form of Cr [3+] presence in urine.
###### **5.4 The Role of Chromium in the Metabolism** ***5.4.1 Metabolism of Carbohydrates***

The association between Cr and carbohydrate metabolism has been demonstrated by
trials involved with results in people fed parenteral nutrition. Jeejeebhoy et al. (1977)


-----

138 R. Iskra and H. Antonyak

have published the results of a trial on women kept at parenteral nutrition for 5 years.
The patients developed symptoms of diabetes together with a significant glucose
intolerance and loss of weight. Insulin therapy was not efficient and it was only after
supplementation of 250 μg of Cr that the state of the patients started to improve and
further insulin therapy became redundant. Also, syndromes similar to diabetes mellitus, which improved significantly after Cr supplementation, have been described
showing an association between reduced sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin
and Cr deficiency (Anderson et al. 1996). The current study aimed to examine the
associations of plasma chromium levels with T2DM and pre-diabetes mellitus (preDM) demonstrated an inverse association between plasma chromium concentrations
and T2DM and pre-diabetes in a Chinese population (Chen et al. 2017). Improved
glucose tolerance was however not observed in all trials. The lack of Cr deficiency or
some other etiological factors may provide an explanation. A number of human studies (Anderson 2000a; Tuzcu et al. 2004), studies on pigs (Wenk et al. 1995), horses
(Pagan et al. 1995; Ott and Kivipelto 1999), cattle (Subiyatno et al. 1996; Bunting
et al. 1994) and rats (Kim et al. 2004) have confirmed the possibility of influencing
glucose tolerance and insulin resistance by Cr supplementation. Supplementation of
Cr and insulin to animal tissues in in vitro experiments has led to increased glucose
oxidation, resulting in CO 2 +H 2 O formation, increased glycogenesis and conversion
of glucose to lipids, all this was in combination with increased glucose utilisation
(Anderson 1997). We have established that the action of chromium chloride and
organic compounds of chromium content of glucose goes down and rises activity of
hexokinase and lactate dehydrogenase (Iskra 2011; Iskra et al. 2014).
###### ***5.4.2 Metabolism of Lipids***

Numerous studies show evidence that Cr is essential for lipid metabolism and reducing the risk of atherogenesis. For example, rats and rabbits fed on a Cr-deficient diet
had increased total cholesterol and aortal lipid concentrations and showed increased
plaque formation (Abraham et al. 1982; Pechova and Pavlata 2007). Cr supplementation has decreased the total cholesterol in their blood. An increase of HDL-cholesterol

(Riales and Albrink 1981) and a decrease in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and
triacylglycerols (Lefavi et al. 1993) have been observed in humans after Cr supplementation.

It was established that the addition of chromium (250 mcg/kg) level in the ration
of piglets leads to the decline of cholesterol content in blood plasma (Iskra 2010;
Iskra et al. 2014).
Niacin, or vitamin B3, tends to reinforce chromium’s beneficial effects, especially
on the lipid profile, both raise levels of “good” HDL while lowering “bad” LDL and
triglyceride levels (McKenney 2004).
These results are in agreement with other research (Lifschitz et al., 1980; Mossop
1983). On the other hand, Cr supplementation was not proven to have any effect in
other human trials (Anderson et al. 1983; Rabinowitz et al. 1983; Offenbacher et al.


-----

5 Chromium in Health and Longevity 139

1985; Potter et al. 1985; Uusitupa et al. 1992). These ambiguous results concerning
the response of blood lipids and lipoproteins to Cr supplementation may be due
to differences in the Cr supplementation of different individuals. Similarly, these
studies mostly ignored other main dietary factors directly impacting upon the lipid
metabolism.
###### ***5.4.3 Metabolism of Proteins***

It is assumed that the activity of Cr is mediated by the anabolic action of insulin,
but other mechanisms cannot be ruled out (Pechova and Pavlata 2007). Evans and
Bowman (1992) have demonstrated increased amino acid and glucose uptake by
skeletal muscles of rats that had been incubated with Cr-picolinate. This alteration
in uptake of nutrients was associated with the alteration of insulin parameters and
is Cr-dependent. These observations may explain the effect of glucose tolerance as
well as the increase in the percent of skeletal muscle reported by some researchers.
The potential improvement of amino acid uptake by muscle cells is beneficial to the
total protein deposition. Roginski and Mertz (1969) claim that Cr supplementation
intensifies the incorporation of amino acids into heart proteins and amino acid uptake
by tissues in rats.
It was established that the addition of chromium (250 μg/kg) level in the ration of
piglets leads to increase of protein content in blood plasma (Iskra 2010; Iskra et al.
2014). ***5.4.4 Chromium and Body Composition***

Another effect of chromium supplementation that could be a result of its potentiation of insulin sensitivity is the redistribution of body fat, protein and water. The
mechanism of this regulatory action of Cr is not known.
It has been proposed that the positive effect of chromium picolinate on body composition is through its ability to improve insulin use, thereby reducing fat deposition
and improving entry of glucose and amino acids into muscle cells.
Chromium has been reported to increase lean body mass in people who exercise,
such as football players, however, some follow-up studies have not supported these
observations (Anderson 2000b). However, the role of chromium in the regulation
of lean body mass, percentage body fat, and weight reduction is still controversial
because a significant number of studies do not support the effect of chromium on
body composition.


-----

140 R. Iskra and H. Antonyak
###### ***5.4.5 Metabolism of Nucleic Acids***

Trivalent Cr seems to be involved in the structure and expression of genetic information in animals. The binding of Cr to nucleic acids is stronger than in other metal
ions (Okada et al. 1982). Chromium protects RNA from heat denaturation. It is also
clear that Cr is concentrated in cell nuclei. Cr has increased in vitro RNA synthesis
in mice (Okada et al. 1983); this supports the hypothesis that Cr has an effect on
gene functions. Chromium participates in gene expression by binding to chromatin,
causing an increase in initiation loci and consequently, an increase in RNA synthesis. This increase is due to the induction of protein bound in the nucleus and nuclear
chromatin activation (Okada et al. 1989). ***5.4.6 Metabolism of Mineral Substances***

There are relatively few papers on the effect of Cr supplementation on the metabolism
of other mineral substances. The relation between Cr and Fe has been investigated
most since both these minerals are transported as transferrin-bound. Cr is bound to
transferrin that possesses two binding sites: A and B with different affinities for Fe
as a function of pH. At low Fe saturation, Cr and Fe bind preferentially to different
binding sites. It has been shown that Cr binds exclusively to site B. When, however,
the Fe concentration is higher, the two minerals compete for the same binding sites.
Thus, there is antagonism between Cr and Fe competing for this carrier (Sayato et al.
1980).
This seems to be the reason why a lower Cr retention has been identified in
patients suffering from hemochromatosis than in healthy subjects or patients with
a Fe deficiency (Sargeant et al. 1979). Evidence that Cr may impair Fe metabolism
has been published by Ani and Moshtaghie (1992). Fe homeostasis alteration has
been reported by other authors too, the most significant alteration being detected in
association with Cr-picolinate supplementation (Lukaski et al. 1996). Alteration of
Fe metabolism in association with Cr supplementation has also been reported by
Anderson et al. (1996), decreased tissue Fe concentrations was detected in response
to Cr supplementation.
Mineral metabolism in experimentally induced Cr deficiency, using goats, has
been explored in detail by Frank et al. (2000a, b) on the basis of deter mining Al, Ca,
Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, P, Pb, Se, Sr, V and Zn concentrations in the
liver, kidneys, ribs and blood plasma. They detected a renal Cu concentration 43%
lower compared with controls and conversely, higher Al, Co and V concentrations
in the kidneys and liver. The authors attribute the increased concentrations of these
minerals to a decreased Cr concentration causing subsequent freeing of binding sites
on the transferrin, competed for by the individual minerals. A decreased loss of
some microelements (Zn, Fe, Cu and Mn) during stress after Cr supplementation to
mice has been reported by Schrauzer et al. (1986). Interaction between Cr and Cu


-----

was studied by Stahlhut et al. (2006), Cr supplementation had no effect on the liver
or plasma Cu concentrations in cows, although, supplemental Cr resulted in higher
plasma Cu concentrations in calves on Day 279. Similarly Pechova et al. (2002) have
detected higher plasmatic Cu concentrations in response to Cr supplementation in
fattening bulls. Interactions between Cr, Ca and Mg have been reported by MoonsieShageer and Mowat (1993), who found Cr supplementation to be associated with Ca
and Mg concentration increases on Day 7 of the trial.
###### **5.5 Chromium and Lipid Peroxidation**

In addition to its role in glucose and lipid metabolism, chromium also functions as an
antioxidant. Recent studies have shown that chromium protects rats from oxidative
stress associated with exposure to CCl 4 . Also chromium protects against lipid peroxidation in isolated rat hepatocites (Vincent 2007; Anderson 2000a), and decreases
the effects of free radicals in people with type 2 diabetes (Roussel and Zouari 1998).
We found that the action of chromium compounds decreases products of lipid
peroxidation and increase of activity of the antioxidant system enzymes in blood of
rats (Iskra 2011; Iskra et al. 2014). Addition of chromium citrate in a quantity of 25 μg
Cr/kg body resulted to the decreased content of the MDA, activity of superoxide
dismutase, but increased activity of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione
reductase and the content of reduced glutathione compared to their levels in animals
from group II with an experimental diabetes (Iskra and Slivinska 2015).
Chromium(III) protects organism from oxidative stress associated with reactive
oxygen species.
Based on free radical theory by Harman (1956), free radicals, which are reactive
oxygen species (ROS) produced in metabolic pathways, may play a critical role
in aging. These ROS extremely reactive chemical molecules, are considered toxic
to produce oxidative damage to various cellular components which causes cellular
dysfunction that accompanies aging process. The mitochondrial respiration defined
as the main source of ROS, which primarily produce cumulative damage to lipids,
proteinsandmitochondrialDNAandleadtocellularaging(Hoopes 2002;Piotrowska
and Bartnik 2014).
However, recent workers in this and in related fields are exploring the view that
superoxide radical and reactive oxygen species exert beneficial effects. Thus, such
ROS are viewed as involved in cellular regulation by acting as (redox) signals, and
their harmful effects are seen mostly as a result of compromised signaling, rather
than due to direct damage to sensitive targets. According to some followers of this
view, ROS such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide are not just causative agents
of aging but may also be agents that increase the life span by acting, for example, as
prosurvival signals (Liochev 2013).
One of the controversies surrounding the use of Cr(III)-containing nutritional
supplements concerns the proposed roles of such supplements as antioxidants that
reduce the diabetes-related oxidative stress (Cheng et al. 2004; Vinson et al. 2002;


-----

142 R. Iskra and H. Antonyak

Peng et al. 2014), or pro-oxidants that promote the oxidative stress through the
formation of ROS (Petit et al. 2005).
The dual action of Cr(III) as an antioxidant or a pro-oxidant, can be explained
based on the redox reactions The reactions of Cr(III) complexes with lipid peroxides
are probably responsible for the abilities of these compounds to reduce the levels
of lipid peroxidation (Cheng et al. 2004; Vinson et al. 2002), but these reactions
produce other strong oxidants such as Cr(V) species. These species, as well as the
peroxyl (ROO·) radicals formed in the redox cycling reactions of certain Cr(III)
complexes, are probably responsible for the increases in the oxidative stress markers
caused by Cr(III) administration (Medeiros et al. 2003; Petit et al. 2005). Thus,
Cr(III) complexes used as nutritional supplements are involved in a delicate balance
between the oxidation and the reduction reactions in blood plasma, as shown most
clearly by a change from a mild antioxidant effect of a prolonged treatment with
Cr(III) in type II diabetic patients to a mild pro-oxidant effect of the same treatment
protocol in healthy individuals (Cheng et al. 2004).
###### **5.6 Epigenetic and Toxicological Effects of Chromium**

Cr(VI) compounds induce human respiratory cancers and increase the risk of other
types of human cancers (Costa and Klein 2006). Chronic poisoning by chromium
compounds has been observed at the work place, by direct contact with skin and
mucus membrane, or inhalation of dusts or aerosols (Ducros 1992). Because Cr is
a potent sensitizer, external contacts with chromates and dichromates can induce
allergic eczema in some people (Taton 1993). Reports from the chromate production
industry have identified Cr(VI) as a potential carcinogen (Katz and Salem 1994).
The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has determined that
chromium(VI) compounds are carcinogenic to humans. The National Toxicology
Program 11th Report on Carcinogens classifies chromium(VI) compounds as known
to be human carcinogens.
In laboratory animals, chromium(VI) compounds have been shown to cause
tumors to the stomach, intestinal tract, and lung (Wilbur et al. 2012). Acute inhalation LC50 values in rats for several chromium(VI) compounds (sodium chromate,
sodium dichromate, potassium dichromate, and ammonium dichromate) ranged from
29 to 45 mg chromium(VI)/m [3] for females and from 33 to 82 mg chromium(VI)/m [3]

for males (Gad et al. 1986). Female rats were more sensitive than males to the
lethal effects of most chromium(VI) compounds except sodium chromate, which
was equally toxic in both sexes. Signs of toxicity included respiratory distress, irritation, and body weight depression (Gad et al. 1986).
Cr intoxication is characterised by pathologicalanatomical changes in the kidneys
and liver. Acute intoxication with Cr [6+] leads to acute renal tubular necrosis charac
terised by significant interstitial change and subsequent renal failure (Ellis et al.
1982; Saryan and Reedy 1988). Renal glomeruli usually remain intact. The hepatic
parenchyma develops necrosis only at very high Cr [6+] doses.

The reaction with genetic material is the basis for the carcinogenicity of some
Cr(VI) salts. Cr(VI) is one of the few carcinogenic metals that directly reacts with
DNA, forming adducts, and inducing mutations (Zhitkovich et al. 1996). There are a
number of studies demonstrating that Cr(VI) carcinogenesis involves gene silencing
and other epigenetic effects (Sun et al. 2009; Salnikow and Zhitkovich 2008). Cr(VI)
has been shown to prevent the expression of inducible genes in cells by crosslinking
a histone deacetylase to inducible promoters (Wei et al. 2004). The presence of
this deacetylating enzyme, which removes acetyl groups from lysines in histone
tails, keeps the nucleosome condensed, thereby preventing transcription factors from
binding and activating gene expression (Wei et al. 2004). In order for cells to survive
chronic Cr(VI) treatment, they must adapt and evade apoptosis. The loss of apoptotic
activity is often accompanied by a loss of mismatch repair, since the two processes
are tightly linked. Consistent with the latter, chronic exposure of cells to Cr(VI) or
tumors induced by this agent in humans are often missing mismatch DNA repair
capacity (Takahashi et al. 2005; Peterson-Roth et al. 2005; Reynolds and Zhitkovich
2007).
Cr(VI) exposure leads to silencing of MLH1, a component of mismatch repair,
via a decreased mRNA expression resulting from enhanced H3K9 dimethylation
of its promoter (Sun et al. 2009). In human lung cancers induced by Cr(VI) exposure, silencing of *MLH1* as well as tumor suppressor *p16* was correlated with DNA
methylation of their promoters (Takahashi et al. 2005; Kondo et al. 2006; Ali et al.
2011).
The results of a wide range of studies indicate that the CpG1 methylation level
of p16 could be used as a biomarker of epigenetic effect caused by Cr(VI) treatment, which can enhance cell damage by regulating its expression or affecting some
transcription factors to combine with their DNA strand sites (Hu et al. 2016a, b).
In spite of considerable research effort, the epigenetic mechanisms of Cr(VI)induced carcinogenesis remain largely unknown.
Nupr1 (nuclear protein 1) is a small, highly basic, and unfolded protein with
molecular weight of 8800 daltons and is induced by a variety of stressors. Studies in animal models have suggested that Nupr1 is a key factor in the development
of lung and pancreatic cancers, with little known about the underlying molecular
mechanisms (Chen et al. 2016). Nupr1 mRNA is strongly induced by a variety of
stressors such as lipopolysaccharides (Jiang et al. 1999), CCl 4 (Taieb et al. 2005),
starvation (Zinke et al. 2002), cell cycle arrest and many others. Overexpression
of Nupr1 has been implicated in a number of cancers. Nupr1 enhances the expression of at least two major epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes,
namely MMP9 and MMP13 metalloproteases (Goruppi et al. 2007). Downregulation
of H4K16ac is likely a mechanism whereby Nupr1 promotes cancer development.
Recent study has demonstrated that Nupr1 overexpression inhibits acetylation of
lysine 16 of histone H4 (H4K16ac) (Gironella et al. 2009) and the histone acetyltransferase MOF (Kat8, Myst 1), which specifically acetylates H4K16 (Smith et al.
2005). The loss of H4K16ac and MOF correlate with increased genome instability,
which is considered an important step in cancer development (Taipale et al. 2005;
Li et al. 2010; Gupta et al. 2008). The loss of H4K16ac is found in a number of


-----

tumors, including lung cancer and considered as a ‘hallmark’ of human cancer (Van
Den Broeck et al. 2008; Song et al. 2012; Fraga et al. 2005). Cr(VI) exposure leads
to increase in the level of Nupr1 in human bronchial epithelial BEAS2B cells and
the loss of H4K16ac. Cr(VI)-induced reduction of H4K16ac appears to be caused
by the induction of Nupr1, since overexpression of Nupr1 decreases the levels of
H4K16ac, while knockdown of Nupr1 by siRNA greatly compromised the loss of
H4K16ac following Cr(VI) exposure (Bollati et al. 2010). Importantly, overexpression of Nupr1 induces anchorage-independent cell growth and knockdown of Nupr1
expression prevents Cr(VI)-induced cell transformation. Together, downregulation
of H4K16 acetylation through inducing Nupr1 expression might represent a new
mechanism for Cr(VI) carcinogenesis.
Based upon these findings, it is conceivable that an epigenetic modification of gene
expression patterns may be a key element of the developmental and carcinogenic
outcomes of exposure to chromium (Schnekenburger et al. 2007)
It is thought that Cr(VI) is carcinogenic while Cr(III) has such a low toxicity that
delaterious effects from excessive intake of this form do not occur readily (Barceloux
1999). It becomes toxic only at extremally high amounts. For example, cats tolerate
1000 μg Cr(III)/day and rats 100 μg Cr(III)/kg b.w. Chromium(III) compounds have
a relatively low order of toxicity when ingested. Animal and human studies suggest
that long-term supplemental intakes of 200 μg/day, and short-term intakes (several
months) between 200 and 1000 μg/day are safe.
The safety limit for Cr [3+] is approximately 1:10 000. Cr [3+] toxicity is in fact lower
than the toxicity of all other essential elements such as Cu, I, Zn, Mn and especially
Se (Lindemann 1996). The toxicity of Cr [6+] compounds is most probably based on
an oxidative DNA impairment (Cohen et al. 1993). The details of Cr [6+] toxic activity
are however not known.
Itisassumedthatgenotoxicitymaybeduetoatransientform(Cr [5+] )ofintracellular
origin formed by the reduction of Cr [6+] to Cr [3+] (Stearns et al. 1995). Extracellular
reduction of Cr [6+] to Cr [3+] is regarded as a protective reaction (De Flora et al. 1989).
In addition, it is difficult to distinguish between the effects caused by
chromium(VI) and those caused by chromium(III) since chromium(VI) is rapidly
reduced to chromium(III) after penetration of biological membranes and in the
gastric environment (Petrilli et al. 1986; Samitz 1970). The first defense against
chromium(VI) after oral exposure is the reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III)
in the gastric environment where gastric juice (De Flora et al. 1987) and ascorbate
(Samitz 1970) play important roles by an NADPH-dependent mechanism.
However, whereas chromium(VI) can readily be transported into cells,
chromium(III) is much less able to cross cell membranes (Hu et al. 2016a, b). Reduction of chromium(VI) in the red blood cell occurs by the action of glutathione. Since
the red blood cell membrane is permeable to chromium(VI) but not chromium(III),
the chromium(III) formed by reduction of chromium(VI) by glutathione is essentially trapped within the red blood cell (Devoy et al. 2016). Eventually the diffusion
of chromium(VI), the reduction to chromium(III), and complexing to nucleic acids
and proteins within the cell will cause the concentration equilibrium to change so
that more chromium(VI) is diffused through the membrane. Thus, there is a physi

-----

ological drag so that increased diffusion results in greater chromium concentrations
in the cell (Aaseth et al. 1982). It appears that the rate of uptake of chromium(VI)
by red blood cells may not exceed the rate at which they reduce chromium(VI) to
chromium(III) (Corbett et al. 1998).
The evaluation of toxicity of Cr [3+] supplements has revolved around questions of
genotoxicity, mutagenicity, and cancer for several reasons. First, carcinogenic Cr [6+]

is metabolized to Cr [3+] in the body, and Cr [3+] may be one of the ultimate species that
interacts with DNA in Cr [6+] -induced cancers. Second, the chemistry and bioavailability of Cr [3+] is altered by its coordinating ligands (Zhitkovich 2005).
Chromium(III) nutritional supplements are widely consumed for their purported
antidiabeticactivities.Researchresultsstronglysupportthehypothesisthattheantidiabetic activity of Cr(III) and the carcinogenicity of Cr(VI) compounds arise from
similar mechanisms involving highly reactive Cr(VI) and Cr(V) intermediates (Wu
et al. 2016).
However, chromium is the same as any other mineral element in that the dose is the
poison. The question that remains to be determined is the concentration at which the
various forms of orally ingested chromium become of toxic concern because homeostatic mechanisms are unable to prevent chromium accumulation in high enough
quantity in cells that will allow chemical reactions that can cause non-repairable
damage to occur.
It thus seems plausible that, under an oxidative-stress situation that might compromise life before reproduction is attained, the balance between dedicating resources to
prolong lifespan or to reproduction be shifted toward the lifespan side. This hypothesis has recently received some scientific support by the discovery of what is known as
the hormetic effect, according to which low doses of either toxic substances may provoke a protective effect, sometimes resulting in a lifespan prolongation rather than in
the expected lifespan shortening. The underlying principle might be an action–reaction mechanism by which the biochemical defences unchained by the stress situation
exceed the insults produced by it (overcompensation).
Chromium(VI) and other heavy metals have recently been reported to show a
relatively low toxicity, as well as a hormetic effect, in long-term viability of fish
(Perez-Benito 2006; Johnson and Radhakrishnan 2015).
Since redox processes play a crucial role in living organisms, and are thought to
unchain a cascade of reactions leading to senescence and other degenerative diseases
in aerobes, the effect of moderate oxidants on their lifespan is a topic of some interest.
###### **5.7 Chromium Deficiency**

Papers dealing with the experimental study of Cr deficiency are relatively scarce
and most of the existing ones quote results of experiments on laboratory animals.
Anderson (1994) has summed up the results of a number of trials on humans, rats,
mice and other animal species in a review of physiological and biochemical symptoms of Cr deficiency that we present in Table 5.1. Frank et al. (2000a, b) have

studied experimentally induced Cr deficiency in goats. The population with a Cr
deficiency showed higher weight gains (31.1 ± 11.7 vs. 20.0 ± 7.3 kg) for the period
of monitoring (84 weeks) compared with the control group. The authors explain
this unexpected effect by the possibility that Cr deficiency has impaired glucose tolerance and increased insulin release subsequently leading to hyperinsulinemia. Cr
deficiency has also led to an increase in haematological parameters (haemoglobin,
haematocrit, erythrocytes, leucocytes and mean erythrocyte volume); increased total
protein concentrations and hyperinsulinemia were observed compared with the group
of controls as well.
###### **5.8 Dietary Chromium Intake and Recommendations**

Trivalent chromium, the form found in foods and nutrient supplements, is considered
one of the safest nutrients (NRC 1989). The Environmental Protection Agency has
established a reference dose, defined as “an estimate of a daily exposure to humans,
including sensitive subgroups, that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of delaterious side effects over a lifetime, that is 350 times the National Research Council’s
upper limit of the “safe and adequate range”.

Recent studies obtained as part of the Trace Elements in Food Research Programme of the FAO European Research Network on Trace Elements (FAO 1989)
demonstrated that the Cr content in animal foodstuffs such as meat, poultry and fish
is low providing 2 μg Cr (Anderson et al. 1992). Most dairy products are also low
in Cr and provide <0.6 μg/serving. Whole wheat and wheat flour contain 5–10 μg
of Cr/kg (Anderson et al. 1992). Pulses, seeds and dark chocolate may contain more
chromium than most other foods (Jorhem and Sundstrom 1993). Certain species
such as black pepper contain high concentrations of Cr (Anderson et al. 1992). Some
brands of beer contain significant amounts of C *�*, some of which presumably comes
from the brewing containers (Anderson and Bryden 1983). According to Mertz et al.
(1974) the best known chromium complex is the glucose tolerance factor, found in
brewer’s yeast.
Most of the average daily dietary Cr intake estimates representing various populations living in 14 different countries ranges between 30 and 60 μg. WHO (1996)
estimates that the daily minimum population mean intake likely to meet normal
requirements for chromium might be approximately 33 μg/person.
Kumpulainen (1992) compared the average dietary Cr in various countries
(Table 5.2). It is thought that dietary chromium intake in the USA and other developed countries is sub-optimal and is 50–60% of the minimum US suggested safe and
adequate daily intake of 50 μg (Anderson et al. 2003).
The Estimated Safe and Adequate Daily Dietary Intake (ESADDI) of Cr as proved
by the Food and Nutrition Board of the US National Academy of Science in 1989. For
adults and adolescents that range was 50–200 mcg (NRC 1989). In 2001, DRIs for
chromium were established. The research base was insufficient to establish RDAs,


-----

148 R. Iskra and H. Antonyak

**Table 5.3** Ade q uate intakes ( AIs ) for chromium ( RDI 2001 )

so AIs were developed based on average intakes of chromium from food as found in
several studies (DRI 2001). Chromium AIs are provided in Table 5.3.
Adult women in the United States consume about 23–29 μg of chromium per day

|Age|Infants and children ( g/day) μ|Males ( g/day) μ|Females ( g/day) μ|Pregnancy ( g/day) μ|Lactation ( g/day) μ|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

|19–50 years||35|25|30|45|
|>50 years||30|20|||

from food, which meets their AIs unless they’re pregnant or lactating. In contrast,
adult men average 39–54 μg per day, which exceeds their AIs. Recently, a new
daily adequate intake (AI) has been set at 35 μg/day for males and 25 μg/day for
females (DRI 2001), which more accurately reflects normal dietary intakes. Because
pregnancy and lactation are known to deplete chromium stores, taking 30 μg daily is
recommended for pregnant women, and women who are breastfeeding should take
at least 45 μg daily.
The average amount of chromium in the breast milk of healthy, well-nourished
mothers is 0.24 μg per quart, so infants exclusively fed breast milk obtain about
0.2 μg (based on an estimated consumption of 0.82 quarts per day) (DRI 2001).
Infant formula provides about 0.5 μg of chromium per quart (Cocho et al. 1973). No
studies have compared how well infants absorb and utilize chromium from human
milk and formula (DRI 2001; Stoecker 2001).
It is believed that intense exercise and traumatic injury also increase the body’s
demand for chromium (Anderson et al. 1997).
Other health care professionals recommend more chromium to help with blood
sugar control, especially for people with existing cases of mild or serious insulinresistance or diabetes.

Dr. Anderson postulates that doses well above these recommended minimum
levels may be necessary to treat chronic diseases. Citing a study conducted in China,
he notes that patients there received up to 1000 μg of chromium per day, a dose
that proved “highly effective” in relieving many of the symptoms of type II diabetes
(Anderson 1997, 1998).

###### **5.9 Diabetes Mellitus and Chromium**

Diabetes mellitus (DM), commonly referred to as diabetes, is a group of metabolic
diseases in which there are high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period. Diabetes
is due to either the pancreas not producing enough insulin or the cells of the body
not responding properly to the insulin produced. In the form of this disease known
as maturity-onset diabetes, the pancreas often continues to secrete normal amounts
of insulin, but this insulin is ineffective in preventing the symptoms of diabetes
which includes heperglycemia, impaired carbohydrate metabolism, glycosuria and
decreased insulin sensitivity (Press and Geller 1990).
Diabetes in particular has been growing at the particularly high rate and is now
one of the world’s most common long term health conditions.
It is estimated that 415 million people are living with diabetes in the world,
which is estimated to be 1 in 11 of the world’s adult population. 46% of people with
diabetes are undiagnosed. The figure is expected to rise to 642 million people living
with diabetes worldwide by 2040.
The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) currently states that the top 5 countries with the highest amount of people with diabetes are as follows:

China: 109 million

India: 69 million

USA: 29 million

Brazil: 14 million

Russian Federation: 12 million

According to the 2013 IDF in Europe, diabetes is estimated to affect 56.3 million
adults aged between 20 and 79—8.5% of the adult population. Even more worryingly,
this figure is set to increase: by 2035, it is estimated that nearly 70 million people
will be living with diabetes in Europe, driving regional prevalence to beyond 10%.
For the 45–74 year-old age group, the prevalence is higher among men, while for
those above 75 years, the rate is higher among women.
In several European countries, diabetes and its complications have caused the
greatest increase of deaths over the past 20 years. Diabetes is ranked among the
leading causes of cardiovascular disease, blindness, renal failure and lower limb
amputation. About 75% of people with diabetes die of cardiovascular events—the
number one cause of death in Europe. People with type 2 diabetes have a 2–4 times
higher risk of coronary heart disease than the overall population.
Of great concern is that children and adolescents are also now developing type
2 diabetes, largely due to the high levels of obesity in these age groups. Estimates
suggest that 1 in 5 children in Europe is overweight and that each year 400,000
children become overweight.
In the late 1950s Schwarz and Mertz (1959) first demonstrated that the dietaryinduced impairment of glucose tolerance in rats could be reversed by the administration of trivalent chromium compounds. Since then, the possible beneficial role of
Cr(III) in carbohydrate, protein and fat metabolism has been extensively studied in

various experimental systems (Wrobel et al. 1999). Experiments carried out so far
in humans can be classified into 3 groups: studies in long-term parenteral nutrition,
administration of high glucose doses, supplementation with various compounds of
Cr(III) (Wrobel et al. 1999).
Also in parenteral nutritional studies chromium deficiency cases were observed
and glucose tolerance was reversed by daily Cr(III) supplementation (Jeejeebhoy
et al. 1977). Further experiments carried out at constant or elevated glucose concentration in plasma, showed an inverse relationship between plasma insulin and plasma
chromium (Morris et al. 1993a, b).
Anderson et al. (1991) studied the effect of Cr(III) supplementation in healthy
subjects, in patients with type 2 diatetes and/or lipemia. The results indicated that
Cr(III) is in some way required for insulin action improving blood glucose, insulin
and lipid indices.
Glucose intolerance, related to insufficient dietary chromium is a widespread
health problem. On the other hand, improved chromium nutrition leads to improved
sugar metabolism in hypoglycemics, hyperclycemics and diabetics (Anderson 1989;
Shinde Urmila et al. 2004). Absorption of chromium from the gut and its urinary
excretion are significantly higher in insulin-requiring diabetes than in healthy subjects. Chromium maintains normal glucose tolerance primarily by regulating insulin
action. In the presence of chromium, much lower amounts of insulin are required
(Anderson 1989). It is important to keep insulin at low levels to prevent secondary
signs of diabetes. There is very strong evidence that insufficient dietary chromium
leads to impaired glucose tolerance that can be alleviated by supplemental chromium.
Fasting glucose, circulation insulin, insulin binding, circulatory glucagon, and
β-cell sensitivity improve with increasing chromium status (Jeejeebhoy et al. 1977).
Response to chromium is related to degree of glucose intolerance. Subjects with
hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia and maturity-onset diabetes have shown to respond
to supplemental chromium, while subjects with normal glucose tolerance with no
signs of marginal chromium deficiency do not respond to supplementation with
chromium.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) increases
with aging (Chang and Halter 2003).
Insulin secretion (both first and second phase) normally decreases at a rate of
0.7% per year with aging; this decrease in β-cell function is accelerated about twofold in people with impaired glucose tolerance—first phase to a greater extent than
second phase. Finally, aging per se has no effect on insulin sensitivity independent
of changes in body composition (Szoke et al. 2008).
Chromium status decline with age. Recent, well-controlled, double-blind studies reported that the glucose tolerance of the elderly subjects given supplemental
chromium improved. However, if subjects were eating well-balanced diets with a
mean Cr intake more than 37 μg Cr/d, glucose tolerance was unchanged.
Urberg and Zemmel (1987) showed that fasting glucose and glucose tolerance
of elders also improved following daily supplementation with 200 μg Cr as CrCl 3
together with 100 μg of nicotinic acid, but not with Cr alone (Anderson 1989). Cefalu

(1998) demonstrated that chromium picolinate appears to increase insulin sensitivity
in moderately obese, nondiabetic subjects.
The number of in-dividuals with impaired glucose tolerance is alarmingly high.
Metabolic syndrome, also known as Syndrome X, is a combination of medical conditions characterized by abnormal glucose metabolism, elevated insulin levels, excess
weight and abdominal fat distribution, disturbances of normally healthy lipid levels,
and high blood pressure—all of which are associated with the subsequent development of type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
While diabetes and cardiovascular disease are well-recognized threats to overall
health, some researchers believe that elevated blood sugar—even absent these other
conditions—contributes directly to aging. By interacting with proteins and nucleic
acids, excess glucose molecules wreak havoc with tissue elasticity and normal function (Turkoski 2004). Thus, controlling blood sugar may actually put the brakes
on the aging process, and should be an essential component of any life-extension

strategy.
###### **5.10 Effects of Chromium on Life Span**

Some of the original studies from the 1960s (Schroeder et al. 1963; Schroeder 1968)
were life-term studies with mice and rats given 5 ppm Cr from Cr acetate (an organic
formoftrivalentCr)indrinkingwatershowedincreasedgrowthoverunsupplemented
controls for both males and females and decreased mortality of males. In a study of
controlledstress,thepercentageofratssurvivingwasgreaterfortheCr-supplemented
group (Mertz and Roginski 1969). Evans and Meyer (1992) fed three groups of rats
1 ppm Cr from either Cr chloride, Cr nicotinate, or CrPic. The authors followed
plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin throughout the study. After 41 months of
supplementation, all rats fed the supplemental Cr from Cr chloride or Cr nicotinate
had died while 80% of the rats fed CrPic remained alive; median life span for the
first two groups of rats was 33 months (a fairly normal life span for laboratory rats)
while median life span for the rats supplemented with CrPic was 45 months (Evans
and Meyer 1994).
A series of studies with broilers provides clear evidence of an effect of Cr on
mortality. The first two studies (Hossain et al. 1998) were conducted in Brazil using
a high Cr-yeast and the latter three studies (Kim et al. 1996a, b, 1997) in Korea using
CrPic.

Mortality rate was significantly lower for Poultry, that were supplemented with
150 PPb Cr [+3] —yeast from 1 to 56 days of age. This reduction in mortality rate could
be due to the role of Cr [+3] —yeast in improving birds health and increase immune
response which result in reducing heat stress (Hossain et al. 1998).
Several points can be made from the studies. First, when mortality is low (and
presumably the cumulative stress from crowding, disease challenge, heat, etc. is low)
there is less of a response to supplemental Cr but when mortality (and presumably


-----

152 R. Iskra and H. Antonyak

stress load) is high then the response to Cr can be quite large. A second point to be
made is that the response is clearly dose dependent.
A question that naturally arises is whether there are potential Cr effects on mortality in reproducing sows. It would seem from our understanding of nutrient responses
that the potential for a response would be greatest in those situations where there
was the greatest departure from normal performance, i.e. when performance was
most compromised. The same concept would exist with regard to potential mortality
benefits in sows. One of the earliest studies reported does illustrate very clearly the
potential benefit of Cr supplementation on some of these parameters. A large study
(Campbell 1996) from Australia involving over 800 sows wherein supplementation
of 200 ppb Cr from CrPic resulted in a highly significant improvement in farrowing
rate (from 79.0 to 92.4%; *p* <0.001). Numerical reductions of more than 60% in
abortions, natural sow deaths, and sows that returned to estrus and were rebred were
also observed with the supplementation. Every aspect of reproductive health that
was recorded was benefited by supplementation. Of particular note should be the
reduction in mortality—a response consistent with the broiler observations.
Numerical improvements in mortality were also observed in the study of Hagen
et al. (2000). The reduction in mortality was greater in fi rst litter sows and sows older
than three parities (both of which had mortality substantially greater than that of the
second and third parity sows). In this study, there were also improvements in litter
size and wean to first service interval. The improvements in litter size were seen for
sows of all parities and the improvements in wean to first service interval were most
pronounced in first parity females (when the interval was greater than that of older
sows). These effects have much statistical strength given the size of the study; this
study utilized 48,000 sows that farrowed almost 100,000 litters for almost 1,000,000
pigs.
Because the body’s ability to control blood glucose is critical to many life functions, a consequence of Cr supplementation can be improved health and reproductive
outcomes as well as improved survival rate or life span.
Cerami (1985) first suggested that elevated blood glucose levels may decrease
survival by accelerating the process known as protein glycation. Later, Masoro et al.
(1992) demonstrated that food restriction in rats resulted in decreased serum glucose
concentrations with a concomitant decrease in glycation of hemoglobin.
The results demonstrate that chromium in a utilizable form, like dietary restriction,
prevents hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, protein glycation and extends life span.
Anincreaseinlifespanofrodentsresultingfromchromiumsupplementationhasbeen
noted previously (Mertz and Roginski 1969; Schroeder 1968). Additions of CrO 3
to the drinking water increased the survival of rats compared to unsupplemented
controls. A significant increase in the mean age of the tenth-percentile survivors was
observed when male rats fed a chromium deficient diet were supplemented with
chromium acetate in the drinking water (5 μg Cr [+3] /ml). In addition, the survival of
male mice fed a chromium deficient diet was significantly increased when the mice
were supplemented with chromium acetate in the drinking water (5 μg Cr [+3] /ml).
The antiaging effect of chromium is undoubtedly related to the effect of chromium
on insulin action, since several investigations with cell cultures, animals and human,


-----

5 Chromium in Health and Longevity 153

provide evidence that chromium increases insulin sensitivity. Investigators discovered that the symptoms of diabetes which developed during long-term parenteral
nutrition could be prevented by the addition of chromium to the intravenous solution
(Jeejeebhoy et al. 1977; Freund et al. 1979). When either swine or heifer calves were
fed chromium picolinate in the diet, increased plasma glucose clearance rates were
accompanied by decreased plasma insulin levels (Evock-Clover et al. 1993).
Evans and Bowman (1992) and Evans and Pouchnik (1993) discovered that insulin
internalization was markedly increased in rat muscle cells cultured in a medium that
contained chromium picolinate and the increased internalization rate was accompanied by a marked increase in the uptake of both glucose and leucine. The effect was
specific for chromium picolinate since neither zinc picolinate nor any other form of
chromium tested was effective.

Schroeder et al. (1963) established the fact that chromium deficiency leads to
increased mortality while other results prove that the form in which chromium
is ingested also influences the aging process. Chromium picolinate is a neutral,
lipophilic complex while chromium nicotinate is a charged complex (Evans and
Pouchnik 1993). Chromium chloride of course dissociates into the ionic components. Absorption experiments demonstrate that the charged forms of chromium are
notreadilyabsorbedwhenmixedwiththedietandtestsofbiologicalfunctionindicate
that chromium nicotinate and chromium chloride are either unstable in physiological
media or are simply not utilized by cells (Mertz and Roginski 1969; Evans and Meyer
1992; Evans and Pouchnik 1993).
Glucose is the preferred carbon and energy source in prokaryotes, unicellular
eukaryotes, and metazoans. However, excess of glucose has been associated with
several diseases, including diabetes and the less understood process of aging. On
the contrary, limiting glucose (i.e., calorie restriction) slows aging and age-related
diseases in most species. Understanding the mechanism by which glucose limits life
span is therefore important for any attempt to control aging and age-related diseases.
The pro-aging effect of glucose signaling on life span correlated with an increase in
reactive oxygen species and a decrease in oxidative stress resistance and respiration
rate (Roux et al. 2009).
Thus, when adequate quantities of chromium are ingested in a form that can be
absorbed and utilized inside the body, insulin resistance and the subsequent hyperinsulinemia which occurs can be prevented. Because hyperinsulinemia has been associated with long term deleterious effects (Reaven 1988), we suggest that chromium,
like dietary restriction, increases longevity by preventing development of symptoms
associated with insulin resistance.
###### **5.11 Conclusions**

Trivalent chromium is essential to normal carbohydrate, lipid and protein
metabolism. Chromium is an essential micronutrient which is required for the normal functioning of insulin and regulation of blood sugar levels. It acts as a vital

antioxidant for maintaining insulin homeostasis. Cr(III) supplementation may be
therapeutic or useful as an adjunct treatment for some cases of type 2 diabetes or
other disorders caused by insulin insensitivity.
Cr(VI) is a strong oxidant—in the form of chromates and dichromates it penetrates
biological membranes and reacts with cell contents, proteins or nucleic acids, while
being reduced to Cr(III). Research results strongly support the hypothesis that the
antidiabetic activity of Cr(III) and the carcinogenicity of Cr(VI) compounds arise
from similar mechanisms involving highly reactive Cr(VI) and Cr(V) intermediates.
The pro-aging effect of glucose signaling on life span correlated with an increase
in reactive oxygen species and a decrease in oxidative stress resistance and respiration rate. Chromium(III) protects organism from oxidative stress associated with
reactive oxygen species. The results demonstrate that chromium in a utilizable form,
like dietary restriction, prevents hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, protein glycation
and extends life span. Chromium, like dietary restriction, increases longevity by
preventing development of symptoms associated with insulin resistance.

**Abstract** OnlylimiteddirectevidencefromDrosophilastudiesexiststoindicatethat
boron promotes healthy aging and longevity. However, substantial indirect evidence
supports the suggestion that boron does have such an effect. Boron has bioactivity that
affects the formation and activity NAD [+] and SAM, which have been shown to affect
aging and longevity. Evidence has been provided to indicate, that through affecting
these two biomolecules, boron has beneficial effects on inflammatory and oxidative
stress, DNA damage detection and repair, and SAM involvement in methylation and
homocysteine levels. Through these effects, nutritional intakes of boron have been
shown to moderate or alleviate several pathological conditions associated with aging,
including cancer, cognitive decline, sarcopenia, and bone health. These findings
indicate that a diet rich in boron will promote healthy aging and longevity.

###### **6.1 Introduction**

The first indication that boron could affect the aging process came from experiments
with Drosophila fruit flies (Massie et al. 1990; Massie 1994). Drosophila reared on
a medium containing 0.62 μg/g boron exhibited a 9.5% increase in life span when
the medium was supplemented with 10.7 μg boron/g as sodium borate. On the other
hand, adding 43, 216 and 430 μg boron/g medium decreased lifespan by 21.2, 51.9,
and 69.2%, respectively. It was also found that adding 4.3 or 21.6 μg boron/g to
a diet containing 31.1 μg boron/g had no effect on the longevity of old mice. No
suggested mechanism was given for the boron effect on the longevity of Drosophila.
However, it is now known that mineral element intake can affect changes associated F. H. Nielsen ( B )

with aging and many of the chronic and neurodegenerative diseases that decrease
longevity. Studies with cells, animals, and humans have indicated that boron may be
one of those mineral elements.
###### **6.2 Boron Biochemistry Related to Aging and Longevity**

The biochemistry of boron provides some insight as to why boron might affect aging
and longevity. Boric acid forms ester complexes with hydroxyl groups of organic
compounds (Hunt 1998). This preferably occurs when the hydroxyl groups are adjacent and in the *cis* formation. This property results in the formation of complexes
with several biologically important sugars, including ribose (Hunt 1998).
Ribose is a component of adenosine. Some of biomolecules that have been associated with aging and longevity contain adenosine or are formed from adenosine precursors. Among these biomolecules is oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD [+] ), which has the ability to bind two borate molecules to the ribose moiety
and this binding affinity is reduced by phosphorylation and reduction in charge (Kim
et al. 2003, 2004). Boron may also bind to precursors of NAD [+] because they contain the ribose moiety; these include nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide
mononucleotide (NMN). Products of enzymatic reactions in which NAD [+] is a cosubstrate also have the ability to bind boron; these include adenosine diphosphate
(ADP) ribosyl cyclase, O-acetyl-ADP-ribose, and ADP ribose.
Another molecule associated with aging and longevity is S-adenosylmethionine
(SAM). Boron has a higher affinity for SAM than most other recognized boron
ligands in animal tissues (Ralston and Hunt 2001). About 95% of SAM is used in
methylation reactions, which influence the maintenance and activity of DNA, RNA
and proteins (Loenen 2006). **6.3 NAD [+] and SAM Biochemistry in Aging and Longevity** ***6.3.1 NAD [+] in Aging***

Cellular NAD [+] concentrations increase under conditions that increase life span and
decrease during aging or conditions that decrease life span (Verdin 2015). The effect
of NAD [+] on aging and life span apparently occurs through its enzymatic roles.
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is a coenzyme in oxidation-reduction reactions
and is a co-substrate for the sirtuins (SIRTs), adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose
transferases (ARTs), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs), cyclic ADP-ribose
(cADPR) synthases (CD38 and CD157) (Verdin 2015).
There are seven SIRTs in mammals; three of these, SIRT1, SIRT3, and SIRT6 have
been associated with aging and longevity (Verdin 2015). Calorie restriction, which


-----

6 Boron in Aging and Longevity 165

increases life span, depends upon NAD [+] sensing by SIRT1. Located in the nucleus,
SIRT6 is linked to aging by regulating telomere stability and inflammation through
NF-κB signaling. Loss of SIRT6 results in progeria, and gain of SIRT6 function
extends life span in mice. The major mitochondrial deacetylase, SIRT3, expression
is enhanced by calorie restriction and depressed by a high-fat diet, factors that affect
aging and longevity.
The DNA-dependent nuclear PARP1 is important in in DNA damage detection
and repair and for the decision by a cell to repair itself or die after a genotoxic insult
(Verdin 2015). In addition, PARP1 is required for the assembly of cytoplasmic stress
granules that regulate the stability and translation of mRNA in response to stress,
which affects aging.
One hypothesis to explain aging is the free radical theory. This theory proposes
that the accumulation of reactive oxygen species or oxidative stress causes cell and
organs to age. Overexpression of the cADPR synthase, CD38, which decreases cellular NAD [+] concentrations, have been associated with increased oxidative stress and
decreased expression of proteins that have roles in anti-oxidant response and DNA
repair (Verdin 2015).
###### ***6.3.2 SAM in Aging***

Factors affecting methylation of both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA and elevating
homocysteine influence aging and age-related disorders (Park et al. 2012; Iacobazzi
et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2015). Longevity and aging have been associated with
SAM and its effect on DNA methylation or epigenetic alterations in animal and cell
models. For example, increased liver SAM and methyltransferase activity correlated
with elevated global DNA methylation in long-lived Snell Dwarf mice (Vitvitsky
et al. 2013). Regulating SAM was found to extend *Drosophila* lifespan (Obata and
Miura 2015). Methionine restriction, which increases lifespan, increases hepatic
global DNA methylation in adult but not young mice (Mattocks et al. 2017). DNA
hypomethylation of telomerase reverse transcriptase induced by homocysteine was
found to increase senescence of endothelial cells (Zhang et al. 2015).
DNA methylation resulting in epigenetic modification is influenced by nutrients
that affect levels of the methyl donor, SAM, and the methyl transferase inhibitor,
S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), which can be hydrolyzed into homocysteine (Park
et al. 2012). For example, cognitive impairment in aging has been associated with
impaired SAM methylation reactions and homocysteine neurotoxicity caused by
vitamin B deficiencies (Selhub et al. 2010). Also, methyl-deficient diets and supplementation with phytonutrients such as polyphenols and isoflavones alter epigenetic
patterns, which have been associated with anti-cancer effects (Park et al. 2012).

###### **6.4 Boron Association with Aging and Longevity Through** **Affecting NAD [+] and SAM Formation and Activity**

Nutritional amounts of boron (amounts found in diets following dietary guidelines)
have been found to affect NAD [+] and SAM formation, metabolism, and activity in
animal and cell models. This is the basis for the suggestion that boron has beneficial
effects in animals and humans (Nielsen and Meacham 2011; Nielsen 2014, 2017).
This also can be the basis for the concept that boron can affect aging and longevity. ***6.4.1 Inflammatory and Oxidative Stress***

The binding of extracellular NAD [+] to the membrane receptor CD38, an ADP-ribose
cyclase, converts NAD [+] to cADPR. Cell culture studies show that boron binds to and
is a reversible inhibitor of cADPR, which binds the ryandodine receptor and induces
the release of Ca [2+] from the endoplasmic reticulum. (Henderson et al. 2009). Boron
in concentrations that are found in blood was found to decrease Ca [2+] release from
ryandodine receptor-sensitive endoplasmic reticulum stores. Elevated Ca [2+] release
results in increased inflammatory and oxidative stress through the release on inflammatory neuropeptides, cytokines, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes (Weglicki 2012).
Aging is associated with a chronic increase in proinflammatory cytokines, especially
Interlukin-1 (IL-1) and interlukin-6 (IL-6) (Roubenoff et al. 1998). In the Framingham Heart Study, increased amounts or production of tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α) and IL-6 were associated with increased mortality in community-dwelling
elderly adults (Roubenoff et al. 2003). Thus, boron may beneficially modify agepromoting oxidative and inflammatory stress.
Further support for boron affecting aging through alleviating oxidative and inflammatory stress is numerous studies showing that boron modulates this induced stress in
animals and cells. Cell culture studies have shown that boric acid inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TNF-α formation through a thiol-dependent mechanism in
human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells (Cao et al. 2008) and calcium fructoborate
decreased IL-1β release by LPS-stimulated murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells
(Scorei et al. 2010). Animal studies have found that boric acid increases the antioxidant capacity of spleens in rats (Hu et al. 2014); prevents damage to membranes of
the cerebral cortex through anti-oxidant action in rat pups from alcohol-treated dams
(Sogut et al. 2015); and inhibits lipid peroxidation induced by arsenic trioxide in rats
(Kucukkurt et al. 2015). Borax was found to increase serum total-anti-oxidant activity, and hepatic expression of both Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase and Mn-superoxide
dismutase mRNA in rats injected with sheep red blood cells in the footpad (Bhasker
et al. 2016).
Human studies also have found boron modulates oxidative and inflammatory
stress. These studies include two that found that boron supplementation reduces
C-reactive protein (CRP) in individuals with serum concentrations greater than


-----

6 Boron in Aging and Longevity 167

3.0 mg/L, which is considered an indicator of chronic inflammatory stress. Boron
supplemented at 3.0 mg/day as calcium fructoborate significantly decreased elevated serum CRP concentrations in 29 patients with stable angina pectoris, while 29
patients without supplementation showed no change at both 30 and 60 days (Militaru et al. 2013). In another double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study, groups
of 26–28 healthy individuals with mean serum CRP concentrations >3.0 mg/L were
given a placebo or supplemented with boron at either 1.5 or 3 mg/day as calcium
fructoborate for 30 days (Rogoveanu et al. 2015). Compared to the placebo group,
both boron supplementations significantly reduced the serum concentrations of CRP,
IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1.
###### ***6.4.2 DNA Damage Detection and Repair***

The changing of cellular Ca [2+] release by boron through reversible cADPR inhibition
also has been found to activate eukaryotic initiation factor-α (eIF2α), which protects
cells by redirecting gene expression to manage endoplasmic stress (Kobylewski et al.
(2017). Gene expressions that were ultimately increased by boron were DNA damage-induced protein 34 (GADD34) and homocysteine-induced endoplasmic reticulum protein (Herp). These gene expression changes and the finding that boron binds
NAD [+] and an enzymatic product of this molecule, cADPR, which affects the action
of cADPR, allows for the speculation that boron may influence aging and longevity
through means other than just moderating oxidative and inflammatory stress. This
would include boron affecting telomere stability and DNA damage detection and
repair actions of SIRTS and PARP1. Indirect evidence for boron having such an effect
has been reported. Cell culture studies have found that borate inhibited micronucleus
and sister chromatid exchange formations induced by aflatoxin B1 (Turkez et al.
2012); boric acid provided protection against the induction of DNA strand breaks
and micronuclei by lead and cadmium toxicity in V79 cells (Üstünda˘g et al. 2014);
and boric acid protected chromosome structure in human primary alveolar epithelial
cells treated with nicotine (Turkez et al. 2016) and reduced the formation of DNA
double strand breaks in human epithelial cells treated with irinotecan, etoposide, and
doxorubicin (Tepedelen et al. 2016). ***6.4.3 SAM and Homocysteine Metabolism***

Support for the suggestion that boron might affect aging and longevity through
affecting SAM formation and/or utilization are the findings that plasma homocysteine increased (Nielsen and Stoecker 2009; Nielsen 2009) and liver SAM decreased
in rats fed apparently deficient (0.05–0.15 mg/kg) dietary boron and compared to
rats fed supplemented with boron (3 mg/kg diet) (Nielsen 2009). In a randomized,
double-blind, parallel clinical trial, boron supplemented at 3 mg/day as calcium fruc

-----

168 F. H. Nielsen

toborate decreased homocysteine concentrations (Rogoveanu et al. 2015). Another
finding supporting the concept of boron affecting SAM utilization is that the bacterial quorum-sensing signal molecule, auto-inducer-2, is a furanosyl borate ester
synthesized from SAM (Chen et al. 2002). Quorum sensing is the cell-to-cell communication between bacteria accomplished through the exchange of extracellular
signaling molecules (auto-inducers).
###### **6.5 Boron Effects on Aging-Related Changes and Pathology**

Numerous studies have shown that boron in nutritional or physiological amounts
ameliorates pathology associated with shortened age and longevity. Some of the
beneficial effects of boron likely occurred through affecting NAD [+] and SAM as
described above. ***6.5.1 Cancer***

Alleviating inflammatory and oxidative stress might be the reason for boron being
associated with reduced risk for some cancers. Based on a study of 95 cases and
8720 controls, low dietary boron was associated with increased prostate cancer risk
(Cui et al. 2004). The protective effect of boron became stronger with increasing
amounts of boron consumed as a constituent of foods. Since then, boric acid in
concentrations similar to that in blood has been found to inhibit the proliferation of
some human prostate cancer cells in vitro (Barranco and Eckhert 2004; Kobylewski
et al. 2017). Supra nutritional amounts of boron was found to decrease prostate cell
proliferation in vitro through an apoptopic effect including decreasing telomerase
enzyme activity (Korkmaz et al 2014), and decrease growth and mitotic figures
in human prostate adenocarcinoma tumors in nude mice (Gallardo-Williams et al.
2004). Limited studies have found boron to be inversely associated with other forms
of cancer. Cervical smears from 587 women with a mean boron intake of 1.26 mg/day
found 15 cases with cytopathological indications of cervical cancer, but none was
found in 472 women with a mean boron intake of 8.41 mg/day (Korkmaz et al.
2007). In a study of 763 women with lung cancer and 838 matched controls, boron
was inversely related with the incidence of lung cancer (Mahabir et al. 2008). Boron
was found to inhibit the proliferation of cultured breast cells in a dose-dependent
manner (Scorei et al. 2008).


-----

6 Boron in Aging and Longevity 169
###### ***6.5.2 Cognitive Function***

The beneficial effect of boron on cognitive function might involve the modulation
of oxidative stress and increased homocysteine, factors that have been implicated in
cognitive decline of aging (Secher et al. 2012). In one study, folate supplementation,
which decreased elevated homocysteine, was found to improve memory, sensorimotor speed and information processing speed (Durga et al. 2007). Boron deprivation
of older men and women altered electroencephalograms (EEG) such that there was
a shift toward more activity in the low frequencies and less activity in the high dominant frequencies of the EEG spectrum (Penland 1994, 1995, 1998). A similar effect
was found in rats (Penland and Eberhardt 1993; Penland 1998). The EEG changes
induced by boron deprivation are similar to that found in non-specific malnutrition
and heavy metal toxicity. Increased low-frequency activity is typical of states of
reduced behavioral activation and mental alertness, and has been associated with
impaired vigilance and psychomotor tasks. Decreased high-frequency activity has
been associated with impaired memory performance. These EEG findings support the
finding that boron supplementation after deprivation under well-controlled dietary
conditions improved psychomotor skills of motor speed and dexterity, and cognitive
processes of attention of and short-term memory (Penland 1994, 1995, 1998).
Fatty acids have been suggested to affect the risk for cognitive impairment and
dementia (Secher et al. 2012). One study found that the regular consumption of n-3
polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) rich oils or fish was associated with a decreased
risk for dementia, and regular consumption of n-6 PUFA-rich oils was associated
with increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease and dementia (Barberger-Gateau et al.
2007). In addition to having an effect on neuron membrane fluidity and their vascular
properties, PUFAs affect neuroinflammation; n-3 PUFAs are anti-inflammatory and
n-6 PUFAs are pro-inflammatory (Secher et al. 2012). Boron might have a similar
effect as n-3 PUFAs on aging brain health. An experiment with rats found that boron
affected behavior differently when dietary fat was fish oil (high in n-3 PUFA) instead
of safflower oil (high in n-6 PUFA). Boron-deprived (0.1 mg/kg diet) rats were less
active than boron-supplemented (3.0 mg/kg diet) rats when fed safflower oil based on
reduced number, distance, and time of horizontal movements, front entries, margin
distance, and vertical breaks and jumps in a spontaneous activity evaluation. Feeding
fish oil instead of safflower oil attenuated the activity response to boron deprivation,
which suggests that boron was acting similarly to n-3 PUFA on central nervous
system function (Nielsen and Penland 2006). ***6.5.3 Sarcopenia***

Sarcopenia is the loss of muscle mass and strength that occurs with aging (Morley
et al. 2001). An age-related decrease in estrogen and testosterone apparently accelerates sarcopenia through a decrease in muscle anabolic potential (Secher et al. 2012).


-----

170 F. H. Nielsen

Insulin, which has an anabolic effect on muscle protein, also apparently has a role
in the onset of sarcopenia (Secher et al. 2012). Decreased vitamin D status has been
associated with decreased muscle strength and gait speed, impaired equilibrium, and
increased risk of fall and fractures (Gerdhem et al. 2005). Boron has been shown to
influence the activity of these three hormones, which suggests boron intake might
affect the development of sarcopenia.
Boron supplementation (3.0 mg/day) after boron deprivation 0.25 mg/day for
119 days has been reported to increase serum estrogen and testosterone in postmenopausal women (Nielsen et al. 1987). Boron supplementation also has been
shown to increase plasma testosterone in rats (Naghii and Samman 1997). In addition to increasing circulating estrogen, boron has been found to increase the efficacy
of estrogen supplementation in both rats and humans. In ovariectomized rats fed a diet
containing 0.4 mg/kg boron, a 5 mg/kg boron supplement significantly increased the
beneficial effect of 17β-estradiol supplementation on trabecular bone quality (Sheng
et al. 2001a). The combination of boron and 17β-estradiol, versus either of these alone
markedly improved the apparent absorption of calcium, phosphorus and magnesium
and the retention of calcium and magnesium (Sheng et al. 2001b). Boron supplementation alone did not significantly improve any of these variables in the ovariectomized
rats, which suggests that boron was enhancing the effect of 17β-estradiol. In postmenopausal women, the increases in serum 17β-estradiol and plasma copper induced
by estrogen therapy were significantly higher with a boron intake of 3.25 mg/day
instead of 0.25 mg/day (Nielsen et al. 1992). The higher boron intake also enhanced
the effect of estrogen therapy on serum triglyceride and immunoreactive ceruloplasmin concentrations. The combination of estrogen therapy and higher boron intake
was most effective in increasing serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D concentration in the
postmenopausal women.
Limited evidence suggests that boron can facilitate insulin action. In rats fed a
diet containing 0.2 mg/kg boron, a supplement of 2 mg/kg boron reduced plasma
insulin but did not change plasma glucose concentration (Bakken and Hunt 2003).
Peak insulin release from isolated perfused pancreas of boron-deprived chicks was
almost 75% higher than from pancreas of boron-supplemented chicks (Bakken and
Hunt 2003). The difference was especially noticeable when the perfusate was supplemented with glucose. These findings suggest that boron may reduce the amount
of insulin needed to maintain plasma glucose. An effect on insulin utilization could
be the basis for the observation that boron deprivation induced a modest but significant increase in fasting serum glucose concentration in older men and women fed a
low-magnesium, marginal copper diet (Nielsen 1994).
The seminal finding indicating that boron is a bioactive beneficial element in nutritional amounts was that boron deprivation exacerbated gross bone abnormalities in
chicks fed marginal amounts of vitamin D (Hunt and Nielsen 1981; Hunt 1989).
Subsequently, it was found that boron deprivation exacerbated marginal vitamin D
deficiency-induced decreased calcium and phosphorus absorption and balance in rats
(Hegsted et al. 1991) and increased plasma triglycerides and decreased growth and
femur calcium concentration in chicks (Hunt et al. 1994; Bai and Hunt 1996). Boron
supplementation also has been found to increase plasma 1, 25-hydroxy-vitamin


-----

6 Boron in Aging and Longevity 171

D concentrations in rats (Naghii and Samman 1997). In older men and women,
boron supplementation (3 mg/day) after 63 days of boron deprivation (0.25 mg/day)
increased serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D concentrations (Nielsen et al. 1990; Nielsen
1996).
Support for boron affecting muscle anabolism recently has been provided by a cell
culture study (Apdik et al. 2015). A low dose (81.9 μm) boron treatment increased
myogenic gene expression of myosin heavy chain, MyoD, myogenin, and desmin at
day 4 of differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells.
###### ***6.5.4 Mortality***

Increased amounts or production of catabolic cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 have been
found to be associated with increased mortality in community-dwelling elderly adults
(Roubenoff et al. 2003). This finding suggests that boron might affect mortality
through its effect on TNf-α and IL-6 as described above. A geographical study in
Northern France found boron to be inversely with mortality (Yazbeck et al. 2005). ***6.5.5 Bone Health***

Osteoporosis, which increases the incidence of bone fractures, commonly occurs
with aging. Significant evidence indicates that boron is beneficial for bone health,
especially trabecular and alveolar bone. This beneficial effect likely occurs through
boron-induced beneficial changes in factors (described above) affecting bone formation and maintenance. These factors include oxidative and inflammatory stress,
vitamin D and estrogen function, and NAD [+] activity.
Microcomputed tomography of the fourth lumbar vertebra found that boron deprivation (0.1 vs. 3 mg/kg diet) decreased bone volume fraction and trabecular thickness
and increased trabecular separation and structural model index (a lower value or more
plate-like structure is preferable) in rats (Nielsen and Stoecker 2009). Boron deprivation (0.07 vs. 3 mg/kg diet) in rats also has been shown to decrease trabecular and
alveolar bone volume/total volume in bone repair initiated immediately after tooth
extraction (Gorustovich et al. 2008).
Cell culture studies have indicated that boron may be beneficial for bone formation
and maintenance in humans. Boron in physiological amounts increased mineralized
nodule formation and mineralized tissue-associated mRNA expression to type 1
collagen, osteopontin, bone sialoprotein, osteocalcin and runt-related transcription
factor 2 by cultured osteoblasts (MC3T3-E1) (Hakki et al. 2010). In addition, boron
supplementation increased bone morphogenetic protein-4, -6 and -7 levels. Physiological concentrations (amounts normally found in tissues) of boron increased
calcium deposition in cultured human bone marrow stromal cells (Ying et al. 2011).

In addition boron increased mRNA expression of alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin,
collagen type 1, and bone morphogenetic protein 7 in these cells.
Animal studies indicate that boron can be beneficial for bone formation and
strength. The modification of bioactive glasses (used for bone tissue engineering
and regeneration) to contain boron enhances bone formation (Gorustovich et al.
2006; Wu et al. 2011; Do˘gan et al. 2014). Reported findings indicating that boron is
beneficial to bone strength include boron deprivation decreasing strength variables
determined by a three-point bending test of femurs of female rats (Nielsen 2004) and
femurs of pigs (Armstrong et al. 2002).
A human boron supplementation study also has indicated that boron could be
beneficial for bone maintenance. Six months of providing 226 mg/day of calcium
fructoborate incorporated into margarine improved bone density in 66 of 100 patients
with osteoporosis (Scorei and Rotaru 2011). Because the supplement provided only
20 mg/day calcium, the improvement was attributed to the additional 5.65 mg/day
boron.
###### **6.6 Beneficial and Safe Intakes of Boron**

Both animals and humans deprived of boron exhibit positive health benefits when
dietary intakes are increased in nutritional amounts (Nielsen and Meacham 2011;
Nielsen 2017). In human depletion-repletion experiments, participants responded to a
3 mg/day supplement after consuming a diet supplying boron at only 0.2–0.4 mg/day
(Nielsen 1994, 1996; Nielsen et al. 1987, 1992). Human and animal findings were
used to arrive at a mean population boron intake of 1.0 mg/day to meet the normative
needs of adults (World Health Organization 1996). Thus, achieving a boron intake
between 1.0 and 3.0 mg/day apparently could be considered adequate to obtain any
benefits that boron has on aging and longevity.
Boron is a relatively non-toxic food component. The safe upper intake level (UL)
of boron in the United States and Canada has been set at 20 mg/day for adults (Institute of Medicine, Food and Nutrition Board 2001). The World Health Organization
(1996) first suggested that 13 mg/day would be a safe intake but later increased this
to 0.4 mg/kg body weight or about 28 mg/day for a 70 kg person (World Health
Organization, International Programme on Chemical Safety 1998). The European
Union established an UL based on body weight that translates to about 10 mg/day
for adults (European Food Safety Authority 2004).
An intake of 1.0–3.0 mg/day, which is well below the UL, can be achieved by
consuming foods of plant origin. Foods rich in boron include fruits, leafy vegetables,
nuts, legumes, and pulses (Hunt and Meacham 2001; Choi and Jun 2008). Beverages
based on fruits and grains, such as wine, beer, and cider are also good sources of
boron.

##### **Chapter 7**
#### **Molybdenum**

**Yosef Dror and Felicia Stern**

**Abstract** The transition metal molybdenum (Mo), with atomic weight 95.9, is the
heaviest essential element with an established RDA, and with the lowest intake and
blood concentration. Mo activates in humans 4 enzymes. In bacteria and archaea,
about 100 enzymes are activated by Mo. Each of the human enzymes contains a
pterin-based Mo cofactor (Moco) at its active site. These enzymes are involved in
the decomposition of some metabolites, thus enabling their products to be excreted
by the kidneys. As well, they decompose many drugs, and consequently affect their
pharmacokinetics. This activity is especially important to the elderly people, who
consume drugs at escalating rates. The Mo enzyme activities highly depend on the
Mo blood concentrations. Mo might interact with other metal ions, and thus affect
the enzymatic actions activated by Mo. Lower Mo concentrations (within the regular
range) presumably have a physiological preference over the higher concentrations,
particularly in type 2 diabetic patients. By eliminating bean consumption, diabetics
might decrease dietary Mo intake. Episodes of Mo deficiency and overt toxicity in
healthy people are very rare. A routine inclusion of Mo in the marketed ‘multivitamins’ is questionable, because it is not supported by a robust data.

###### **7.1 Introduction**

Molybdenum (Mo) is a metallic element of the second transition series, with atomic
number 42 and atomic weight 95.94. Mo has chemical properties similar to those
of chromium. Mo is commonly used in steel alloys because it imparts hardness,
strength, heat resistance, and corrosion resistance to these alloys. Mo is present in
all plant and animal tissues and is considered an essential micronutrient for most
life forms (Barceloux 1999). It is the heaviest catalytic metal in humans (and other
mammals). Physiologically, it exists in the body as an ion. Although Mo is the most
abundant transition metal in seawater (107 nM), it is present in low concentrations in
most freshwaters, typically <20 nM (Glass et al. 2012), in soils 1.1 mg/kg (TejadaJiménez et al. 2013) with a range of a trace to 40 mg/kg (US Department of the Interior
1998) and in human serum, 1.15 ng/mL. The transition element Mo is essential for
biological systems, as it is required by enzymes catalysing diverse key reactions in
the global carbon, sulfur and nitrogen metabolism. The metal is biologically inactive
unless it is complexed by a special cofactor. With the exception of bacterial nitrogenase, where Mo is a constituent of the FeMo-cofactor, Mo is bound to a pterin, thus
forming the Mo-cofactor (Moco), which is the active compound at the catalytic site
of all other Mo-enzymes (Vieira et al. 2011).
Mo is scarcely known by the nutritionists, because deficiency or toxicity overt
symptoms are very rare in humans. In some textbooks dealing with trace element
issues that were published during the 80s and the 90s, Mo was thoroughly ignored.
In more recent studies, two most important issues concerning Mo have been almost
disregarded, and therefore have been studied on a limited scale:

A. The effect of Mo concentrations on Mo enzymes that control the pharmacokinetics of the medications. In this matter, the elderly with their high medication
use and their dependency on stable and accurate dynamics of the pharmacokinetics, might be the most vulnerable individuals to the fluctuations in Mo blood
concentrations.

B. ThedisadvantageoftheupperpopulationquartilesofMobloodconcentrationsin
comparison with the lowest concentration quartiles. Concerning this matter, Mo
concentrations are higher in type 2 diabetic patients (Menke et al. 2016; Flores
et al. 2011), spermatogenesis is lower (Meeker et al. 2008) and the viability of
the T-helper lymphocytes (Jurkat cells) is higher at the lower Mo concentrations
(Caicedo et al. 2007).

Mo comprises one of the nine microelements with established RDA. Among these
elements, it has the lowest serum concentration and the lowest established RDA
(Fig. 7.1). In the human nutrition literature, there is the scarcest data for Mo body
fluids, and a minimal data for deficiency and toxicity symptoms and cut-offs. The
intake of the Mo in the US ranged from 120 to 240 μg/d (1.2–2.5 μmol/d) (Tsongas
et al. 1980) or 76 μg/d for females and 109 μg/d, for males. Data from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) indicated that the median
intake of Mo from supplements was 23 mg/d. The RDA and the tolerable upper intake

**Fig. 7.1** A comparison between Mo concentrations in whole body, serum and liver as well as Mo
dietary requirements with those of other microelements (ascending RDA order)

level (UL) for the adults were set by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) as 45 μg/d and
2 mg/d, respectively (Institute of Medicine 2000). All the other micronutrients with
established RDAs have much higher serum concentrations, with those of zinc and
copper laying at the range of ~1000 ng/mL (Fig. 7.1).
*Mo comprises the tinniest amount of all the essential microelements in the human*
*body* . Its concentration is similar to those of the ultra-microelements, such as cobalt,
nickel, or the toxic metals, such as cadmium, mercury, lead and silver (Otten et al.
2006). Mo is very abundant in the oceans in the form of the molybdate anion. In
soils, the molybdate anion is the only form of Mo that is available for plants, fungi,
and bacteria (Mendel and Kruse 2012).
###### **7.2 Physical Characteristics**

Mo atomic radius is 1.40 Å, its density is 10.28 g/mL, the melting point is
2617°, and the boiling point is 4825 °C. Mo common mineral compounds are:
molybdenite (MoS 2 ); powellite (CaMoO 4 ); wulfenite (PbMoO 4 ); ferrimolybdite
(Fe 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 - (H 2 O); and ilsemannite (Mo 3 O 8 ). The global production (2013) was
258,000 tonne/year (Index Mundi). The ores concentration is 0.5% (Chappell et al.
1979). The oxidation states range from -II to VI. Mo belongs to the class of inorganic


-----

compounds known as homogeneous transition metal compounds. The pure metal is
silvery white in color, fairly soft, and has one of the highest melting points of all
pure elements. Mo is used in metallurgical applications, in oil pipelines, aircraft and
missile parts, in filaments of some X-ray tubes, particularly in mammography applications, in some lubricants, and in the nuclear isotope industry (Barceloux 1999).
Mo pigments range from red-yellow to a bright red orange and are used in paints,
inks, plastics, and rubber compounds (HMDB).
###### **7.3 Occurrence**

Plants and animals generally contain Mo in amounts of a few parts per million
(HMDB). The major anthropogenic sources of Mo in the environment are the following: combustion of coal, municipal sewage sludge, and industrial or mining operations. The daily intake of Mo from the air and from drinking water is negligible
compared to its absorption from the diet. The concentration in fly ash ranges from
7 to 160 mg/kg. The concentration in soil averages ~1–2 mg/kg. Mo-deficient and
Mo-excessive soils are defined by concentrations of 0.2 and 0.7 mg/kg, respectively.
Most natural waters contain low levels of Mo in the range of <2–3 μg/L (Barceloux
1999). Concentrations of Mo in water are variable, ranging from 0.01 mg/L in the
ocean up to 30 mg/L, in some American rivers. Mo concentrations in drinking water
are generally low (up to 6 μg/L). In the vicinity of the areas where Mo ore is mined,
drinking water contamination may occur, leading to intakes of >1000 μg/d ( Curkovi´c [´]
et al. 2016). In the British waters data for 1735 groundwater samples from across
Britain have a 10–90th percentile range for Mo of 0.035–1.80 μg/L with a median
of 0.20 μg/L (Smedley et al. 2014). Tobacco contains only small concentrations
(0.3–1.76 μg Mo/g) and, therefore, smoking probably is not a significant source of
Mo (Barceloux 1999). **7.4 Catalytic Activity**

A recent opinion, based on in silico calculations, claims that almost half of all the
enzymes (47%) must associate with a particular metal to function (as metalloenzymes). A catalogue of the principal type of enzyme that uses each metal reveals that
iron (81%), copper (93%) and Mo plus tungsten (81%) are most commonly used as
conduits for electrons in oxidoreductases. Cobalt and Mo are found almost exclu
sively in association with cofactors in vitamin-B12-dependent and molybdopterindependent enzymes (Waldron et al. 2009). Mo occurs in a wide range of metalloenzymes in bacteria, archaea, fungi, algae, plants and animals, where it forms part
of the active sites of these enzymes. However, in order to gain biological activity, Mo requires the coordination by a pyranopterin, thus forming a prosthetic group
named Mo-cofactor (Moco). Mo is bound to the pterin-based Moco of those enzymes,


-----

7 Molybdenum 183

which in most cases harbours additional prosthetic groups for intramolecular electron transfer (Belaidi et al. 2015). Mo participates only in <1% of all the activated
metalloenzymes (Waldron et al. 2009).
Mo has a versatile redox-chemistry that is used by the enzymes to catalyse diverse
redox reactions. This redox-chemistry is controlled both by the different ligands at the
Mo atom and the enzyme environment. Mo-containing enzymes are essential for life,
since they hold key positions both in the biogeochemical redox cycles of nitrogen,
carbon, and sulfur on earth and in the metabolism of the individual organism. So
far, >100 enzymes are known to be Mo-dependent. The vast majority of them are
found in bacteria, whereas in eukaryotes only 7 Mo-dependent enzymes have been
identified. Mo is an essential trace element, i.e. the organism needs it only in minute
amounts. There is a trace requirement for Mo in plants, and soils can be barren due
to Mo deficiencies (Mendel and Kruse 2012; Schwarz 2016). Mo ion in mammals
and presumably in all higher animals activates only 4 enzymes whereas in plants,
Mo catalyses also nitrate reductase (NR) (Tejada-Jiménez et al. 2013).
In humans, deficiency symptoms are confined to rare congenital diseases or enteral
and parenteral feeding, whereas toxicity is mainly confined to the industrial or the
environmental contaminations (Freeland-Graves and Turnland 1996; Turnlund et al.
1995). Therefore, Mo has attracted only a limited attention for its activities, description of deficiency or toxicity, and more importantly for the monitoring of the normal
serum level.

However, it might show a pivotal role in the maintenance of optimal health status,
in particular, in the frail elderly. The accepted adequate intake and the UL are only
a general frame for the optimal intake that is located somewhere in this frame with
some unknown nadir range that warrants optimal serum concentration and optimal
intake.
###### **7.5 Mo Enzymes in Humans**

The versatile redox chemistry of Mo is mirrored by the plethora and complexity of
enzymes using Mo in bacteria and plants. Nature has developed two very different
systems to control the redox state and catalytic power of Mo (Schwarz et al. 2009).
Four Mo-dependent enzymes are known in humans, each harboring a pterin-based
cofactor (Moco) in the active site (Maia and Moura 2015):

a. Sulfite oxidase (SO)
b. Xanthineoxireductase (XOR)
c. Aldehyde oxidase (AO)
d. Mitochondrial amidoxime-reducing component (mARC).

Mo is considered an essential element, because it is required for the function of the
above enzymes, which play an essential role in the catabolism of the sulfur amino
acids and the compounds, such as purine and pyrimidine. Mo enzymes catalyze
key redox reactions in the global carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen cycles. Their overall


-----

184 Y. Dror and F. Stern

reaction is characterized by the transfer of an oxygen atom to or from a substrate
in a two-electron transfer reaction. Except for the well-known activities of the Moenzymes in the purine and sulfur metabolism, these enzymes are involved in drug
metabolism and clearance. A study of the major clearance pathways of the top 200
most prescribed drugs showed that 73% of all the drugs were eliminated primarily
through hepatic metabolism, 25% by renal and 2%, by biliary clearance (Di 2014).
*With the increased role of the drug metabolism in our lifestyle, the activity of the*
*Mo enzymes in drug metabolism should attract a particular interest.*
Though serum Mo in humans lays at a very low concentration range in comparison
to all other microelements, Mo might have a critical role in the metabolic clearance
of drugs. Drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic disciplines play central roles in our
understanding of the fate of most drugs in the body. Because most marketed drugs are
cleared by metabolism, it is not surprising that a clear understanding of metabolism
and metabolic enzymes and pathways is critical in drug discovery to optimize drug
activities (Fan et al. 2016).
With the accelerated extension of longevity, drug clearance and its pharmacokinetics become one of the most important issues in our welfare, our lifestyle and
probably even our longevity. Human Mo enzyme activities, besides being dependent
on Mo concentration and kinetics they are also dependent on the interactions with
other compounds and other metals. The stability of all of these parameters might
seriously affect drug kinetics (Rowland et al. 2012). Drug metabolizing enzymes
play a very important role in the drug clearance by converting lipophilic molecules
to more water-soluble metabolites. Certain drug metabolizing enzymes are polymorphic, leading to a high pharmacokinetic variability, toxicity or loss of efficacy.
Metabolites generated by the drug metabolizing enzymes, such as AO and XOR
can be pharmacologically active, and reactive metabolites that might cause toxicity
are formed during the bioactivation (Di 2014). Current estimates suggest that only
10% of potential drug targets are currently addressed, and in the future, new target
classes for drug discovery will be actively pursued. In recent years, the number of
compounds in clinical trials targeting kinase inhibition has risen dramatically. It is
predicted that the number of compounds targeting ion-channel modulation will also
significantly increase. Clearance of drugs would more than likely be mediated by
a non-cytochrome 450 based mechanisms, and alternative metabolic pathways, for
example, pathways mediated by AO would become more important (Pryde et al.
2010).
Mo hydroxylases, which include AO and XOR, are involved in the metabolism
of some medicines in humans. They exhibit oxidase activity towards various heterocyclic compounds and aldehydes. The liver cytosol of various mammals also exhibits
a significant reductase activity toward nitro, sulfoxide, N-oxide and other moieties,
catalyzed by AO. There is a considerable variability in AO activity in the liver cytosol
of mammals, with humans showing the highest activity. Various drugs have inducing
or inhibitory effects on AO and XOR. AO linked activities are markedly inhibited
by menadione, isovanillin, chlorpromazine and estradiol, and XOR is inhibited by
oxypurinol (allopurinol, a drug used to treat gout) (Kitamura et al. 2006). To avoid
potential drug interaction risks, such as a toxic excess of drug bioavailability or a


-----

7 Molybdenum 185

loss of drug efficacy, caution is suggested in the use of XOR inhibitors, as in the
case of hyperuricemic patients affected by gout or tumor lysis syndrome, when it is
necessary to simultaneously administer therapeutic substances that are activated or
degraded by the drug-metabolizing activity of XOR (Batteli 2016).
###### ***7.5.1 Mo Cofactor (Moco)***

Moco is synthesized by a conserved biosynthetic pathway. Moco consists of a Mo
atom covalently bound via the dithiolate moiety of a fully reduced pterin backbone.
Synthesis and incorporation of the Moco are essential for the catalytic activity of all
Mo-containing enzymes with the exception of nitrogenase. Moco enzymes catalyze
redox reactions using water as oxygen acceptor or donator. Besides their namegiving functions, Mo-enzymes have been recognized to catalyze novel reactions,
including the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide (Schwarz 2016). Moco biosynthesis
follows an evolutionarily highly conserved pathway and genetic deficiencies in the
corresponding human enzymes result in Moco deficiency, which manifests itself in
severe neurological symptoms and death in childhood (Kasaragod and Schindelin
2016; Schwarz 2016). Disease-causing symptoms mainly go back to the lack of SO
activity, an enzyme in cysteine catabolism. SO is the most important Mo enzyme,
which is mainly found in the liver, where it catalyzes the oxidation of sulfite, which is
generated during the catabolism of cysteine (Belaidi et al. 2015). Interestingly, most
of the symptoms of Moco deficiencies are mirrored in isolated SO deficiency, leading
to sulfite accumulation. Therefore, SO is seen as most important Moco-dependent
enzyme, and sulfite accumulation presents the primary cause of neurodegeneration
in both disorders of Moco and SO deficiencies. Sulfite accumulation is accompanied
by changes in other S-containing metabolites, such as cysteine, S-sulfocysteine,
thiosulfate, homocysteine and taurine (Schwarz 2016; Belaidi et al. 2015; Hobson
et al. 2005). ***7.5.2 Sulfite Oxidase (SO)***

This protein is involved in the sulfur pathway metabolism, which is part of energy
metabolism. Mammalian SO is a dimeric enzyme consisting of Moco and hemecontainingdomain.AnimalSOharborsacytochrome *b* 5-typehemdomaininaddition
to a Moco domain. The catalytic cycle of SO involves electron transfer from sulfite
to Moco, followed by two electron-transfer steps via the cytochrome *b* 5 domain to
the terminal electron acceptor cytochrome *c* (Protein knowledgebase, sulfite oxidase;
Belaidi et al. 2015). In the absence of SO activity (as seen in Moco deficient mammals
and SO deficiency), sulfite accumulates within the cell and has been found to increase
reactive oxygen species (Schwarz 2016; Qin et al. 2011). Endogenous sulfite is an
intermediate metabolite produced in the degradation of the sulfur-containing amino


-----

186 Y. Dror and F. Stern

acids, cysteine and methionine. SO catalyzes the oxidation of sulfite to sulfate in
most tissues, including the brain. Disruption of this pathway occurs in the inborn
error of metabolism isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency and results in progressive
neurodegeneration (Hobson et al. 2005; Kasaragod and Schindelin 2016; Schwarz
2016).
###### ***7.5.3 Xanthineoxireductase (XOR)***

This protein is a key enzyme in purine degradation. It catalyzes the last two steps
of purine catabolism in the highest uricotelic primates, i.e., the oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and the oxidation of xanthine to uric acid. This activity has a
rate-limiting effect on the recovery of nucleotides, because it interferes with the
purine salvage pathway by producing the irreversible products, xanthine and uric
acid. XOR function is not fully understood, and appears wider than merely a housekeeping role in nucleic acid metabolism. XOR has different enzymatic activities; it
can act as (1) an oxidized NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase; (2) an O 2 -dependent
oxidase; (3) a reduced NADH oxidase; or (4) a reductase for N-oxide, nitrite and
nitrate. The products of XOR activity have both oxidant and antioxidant properties
and are involved in the regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure as well as in
the induction of inflammation and the reparative response. XOR has a low specificity for substrates and is able to metabolize a number of endogenous metabolites
and a variety of exogenous compounds, including drugs, thus playing a significant
role not only as a xenobiotic detoxifier, but also as a drug-metabolizing enzyme.
The role of XOR as a drug-metabolizing enzyme is due to the poor specificity of
its enzyme action that allows the utilization of a variety of substrates, including a
wide range of xenobiotics. Specifically, the XOR activity is directly involved in the
metabolism of a number of antiblastic and antimetabolic drugs used against neoplasia, autoimmune disease and viral infection (Protein knowledgebase, xanthine
dehydrogenase/oxidase; (Batteli 2016)). XOR deficiency results in the accumulation
of xanthine in urine leading to a disease termed xanthinuria with a very low level of
plasma uric acid and high levels of xanthine (Schwarz 2016). ***7.5.4 Aldehyde Oxidase (AO)***

Mammalian AO enzymes hydroxylate the rings of various aza-, oxo-, and sulfoheterocycles and oxidize iminiuim functions to cyclic lactams. AO enzymes also
act as reductases, reducing N-oxides, sulfoxides, nitro compounds, and heterocycles, particularly under hypoxic conditions. AO might be a prominent source of
superoxide generation via the one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen (Protein
knowledgebase, aldehyde oxidase).


-----

7 Molybdenum 187

AO plays a key role in the metabolism of xenobiotics and drugs containing aromatic azaheterocyclic substituents. It participates in the bioactivation of prodrugs,
such as famciclovir, catalyzing the oxidation step from 6-deoxypenciclovir to penciclovir, which is a potent antiviral agent. It also metabolizes the non-benzodiazepine
hypnotic, zaleplon. AO in the mammals is characterized by a maximum of 4 *AOX*
genes coding for a corresponding number of AOX isoenzymes. This group of
enzymes has a particular ability, in the medical and toxicological fields, to metabolize a wide range of drugs and environmental toxicants (Pryde et al. 2010; Kitamura
et al. 2006; Terao et al. 2016).
The number of drugs metabolized by AO is large. They include antitumor,
immunosuppressive, antimalarial, and antiviral agents as well as molecules acting in
the central nervous system. Among the antitumor and immunosuppressive agents,
the oldest examples of drugs metabolized by AO enzymes are methotrexate and 6mercaptopurine. In respect to the role of AO enzymes in the metabolism of drugs in
humans, some issues should be discussed. Oxidation of drugs by AO enzymes does
not necessarily lead to metabolic inactivation. In prospective, human AO-dependent
activation of pro-drugs may be a strategy to be pursued in the oncologic field to
increase the therapeutic index of antitumor agents by increasing the tumor selectivity of their pharmacological action. Moreover, the AO-dependent metabolism of
drugs may be relevant in tissues and organs other than the liver. On the basis of the AO
very broad (>100) substrate spectrum, a general role in biotransformation and detoxification can be assumed. AO was also suggested to participate in the metabolism
of neurotransmitters and in the formation of retinoic acid (Mendel and Kruse 2012;
Terao et al. 2016).
AO and XOR isoenzymes are classified as molybdo-flavoenzymes, since they
require FAD besides Moco to oxidize their substrates. AO is homologous with XOR,
another mammalian molybdoflavoprotein, and both AO and XOR show a remarkable degree of similarity in their amino acid sequence. Like XOR, AO is active as
a homodimer composed of two identical subunits of about 150 kDa (Terao et al.
2016). The amino acid sequence of AO and XOR are remarkably similar, with ~86%
homology (Li et al. 2009).
Some drugs are metabolized by both AO and XOR. Generally, AO has lower
substrate specificity than XOR. AO inter-individual differences in AO activities have
been observed in humans, with 50-fold in the benzaldehyde metabolism between
individuals (Sanoh et al. 2015).
###### ***7.5.5 Comparison Between AO and XOR Activities***

Both AO and XOR exhibit broad specificity, accepting a variety of reducing substrates, including purine, pteridine, aldehyde, and NADH. But, AO catalyzes the
oxidation of aldehydes and NADH more efficiently, with lower *Km*, whereas XOR
has higher affinity for xanthine, hypoxanthine, pteridine, and purine (Li et al. 2009).
Age, gender, and toxic agents might have a major effect on the AO activity and this

parameter should be seriously considered in drug development methodology (Terao
et al. 2016; Tayama et al. 2012).
###### ***7.5.6 Mitochondrial Amidoxime-Reducing Component*** ***(mARC)***

The mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component (mARC) is the lately discovered
Mo-containing enzyme in mammals. In the presence of NADH, mARC proteins
(the two homologs, mARC1 and mARC2) exert N-reductive activity together with
the two electron transport proteins cytochrome b5 type B and NADH cytochrome
b5 reductase. This enzyme system is capable of reducing a great variety of Nhydroxylated substrates. It plays a decisive role in the activation of prodrugs containing an amidoxime structure, and in detoxification pathways, e.g., of N-hydroxylated
purine and pyrimidine bases. mARC acts as a component of an N-hydroxylated
prodrug-converting complex required to reduce N-hydroxylated prodrugs, such as
benzamidoxime (Ott et al. 2015). It is also able to reduce N(omega)-hydroxy-larginine (NOHA) and N(omega)-hydroxy-N(delta)-methyl-l-arginine (NHAM) into
l-arginine and N(delta)-methyl-l-arginine, respectively (Protein knowledgebase,
MARC1). There are also hints that the mARC-containing enzyme system acts as
a regulator for NO biosynthesis (Havemeyer et al. 2011). The physiological relevance of mARC is largely unknown (Ott et al. 2015). ***7.5.7 Possible Role of Moco in the NO Synthesis***

The 4 enzymes, activated by Moco, might be involved in the synthesis of nitric oxide
(NO) signaling molecule, which is participating in several physiological processes,
in prokaryotes as well as in eukaryotes. Nitrite is recognized as an important source of
signaling NO, and as a ‘storage form’, that can be made available to maintain NO formation under conditions of hypoxia. Thus, it is particularly relevant to cell signaling
and survival under challenging conditions. Nitrite can exert a significant protective
action during ischemia and other pathological conditions. The non-respiratory nitrite
reduction to NO is carried out by non-dedicated nitrite reductases, making use of
metalloproteins present in cells to carry out other functions, such as several molybdoenzymes, which are a new class of nitric oxide-forming nitrite reductases (Maia
and Moura 2015).

###### **7.6 Human Exposure**

TheMoRDAforadultsis45 μg/d(InstituteofMedicine 2000).Mocomprisesasmall
amount of the sum of all the RDAs for microelements, which totals 26.48 mg/d. For
some of the micronutrients, the allowance, as calculated per body weight, might differ
remarkably from the recommendations for the animal husbandry or experimental
animals. While for the animals, the requirement is estimated according to accelerated
growth and high production, for humans, the guidelines for the optimal intake should
be based on the lowest risk of morbidity, the highest longevity, and the highest quality
of life (Yetley et al. 2016). Much more research is needed to characterize better
markers of micronutrient status in terms of metabolic effects, and large-scale trials
of different doses of micronutrients are required with precise outcome markers to
optimize intakes in different groups of patients as well as in the general population
(Shenkin 2006). *Because Mo might have a considerable effect on the metabolism of*
*drugs, the needs for the most appropriate Mo status might be more critical in humans*
*than in the experimental animals.*
Mo is considered as an essential element with all the ‘multivitamins’ and enteral

and parenteral formulas containing Mo (Iacone et al. 2016). Deficiency has been
described in adult patients and preterm infants, who received very long-term enteral
formulas without Mo supplementation. Clinical sequelae seen in adults with Mo
deficiency include cardiac and neurologic, symptoms, such as tachycardia and coma.
Today all such formulas are supplied with accurate amounts of trace elements. There
is a requirement of 1 μg/kg/d of parenteral Mo and 4–6 μg/kg/d of enteral Mo for
the low birth weight infant. The following amounts of Mo are added to the parenteral
formulas for preterm infants: 2 μg/d until 6 months; 0.3 μg/kg/d thereafter, and for
enteral feeding, 4–6 μg/kg/d (Finch 2015). Mo content in two enteral formulations
for malnourished surgical patients is reported as 10 μg/100 mL (Klek et al. 2017).
Daily requirement for Mo for surgical patients is 20 μg/d (Braga et al. 2017).
In a Winnipeg survey, the average Mo value in human milk was 5.1 ng/mL. A
survey of infant formulas in the US and Canada showed that the average content
was 37 ng/mL (7 fold higher than the average human milk content) with a range
of 15–80 ng/mL. The formula with the highest Mo content contained 16 fold the
concentration of the human milk (Abramovich et al. 2011). This comprehensive
survey shows that the Mo content of the formulas is not based on the human milk
content, and is extremely exaggerated without any logical justification.
Mo is rapidly absorbed from food and water by gut and placenta when present as
the moblydate or trioxide, but not as disulfide, and it is rapidly excreted via the urine.
In a study performed in three communities in Croatia, where people use drinking
water from wells, the urinal concentration was higher than that in serum ( Curkovi´c [´]
et al. 2016). Exogenous or endogenous inorganic sulfate specifically increases Mo
excretion and reduces its retention in tissues. High exposure is rare, but high intakes
(10–15 mg/d) were documented in India, Armenia and Turkey. No biochemical
or clinical effects were observed in humans whose water supplies contained up to


-----

190 Y. Dror and F. Stern

50 μg/L. Increased urinary excretion was observed in humans whose water supplies
contained 50–200 μg/L (Chappell et al. 1979).
###### **7.7 Tissue Concentrations**

The total body Mo ranges from 900 to 5400 μg depending on intake (Novotny and
Turnlund 2007). Mo is widely distributed in the tissues of the body ranging from
approximately 3 μg/g in the liver to approximately 0.15 μg/g in the lung, brain,
and muscle. The skeleton contains over 50% of the total body Mo, presumably due
to the large surface area of the mineral phase of the bone and the possibility of
phosphate-molybdate exchange reactions in hydroxyapatite crystals. Tooth enamel
has appreciable quantities of Mo of the order of 5 μg/g, and might confer some caries
resistance. Rats on a normal dietary intake of Mo have a higher concentration in their
livers than in most other tissues, such as kidney, spleen, brain, muscle (Chappell et al.
1979). Tissue concentrations in Australian sheep, mean and range (μg/g): kidney,
0.44 (0.028–2.28); liver, 1.05 (0.12–2.18); and muscle, 0.014 (Maclachlan et al.
2016). Molluscs and insects accumulate Mo at a range of 0.2–1.05 μg/g of dry
matter. Mice and vole species incorporate 0.35–0.65 μg/g, whereas shrews store
1.5–2.5 μg/g, i.e. insectivores have significantly higher Mo contents than rodents.
The amounts of Mo accumulated by wild and domestic mammals are highest in the
liver and kidneys, and lowest in muscle tissue and hair.
In a Korean study in cadavers the following Mo concentrations were found (μg/g):
nails, 1.9; liver, 0.73; kidney, 0.27; hair, 0.25; lung, 0.10; heart, 0.09; spleen, 0.08;
and cerebrum, 0.05 (Young et al. 2002). In a survey of mineral tests performed by
6 laboratories in the US, the average Mo hair content was 0.63 μg/g with a range
of 0.04–2.8 μg/g. For a comparison, zinc average content was 182 μg/g (Cleeman
2001).
The best indicators of Mo deficiency and intoxication are liver, kidneys, blood and
milk concentrations. Milk delivers sufficient Mo to the newborns (Anke et al. 2007).
Bone, tendon, and cartilage abnormalities, as well as osteoporosis, have been seen
in animals with molybdenosis (Chappell et al. 1979). The high and the fluctuating
Mo concentrations in the liver, and the high activities of the Mo enzymes in the liver
have a major potential for high fluctuations in the drug pharmacokinetics. A stable
Mo concentration is presumably a prerequisite for stable drug activities. **7.8 Blood Concentrations**

Mo blood concentration (whole blood and serum or plasma) in humans is highly
affected by Mo intake (Turnlund and Keyes 2004; Hays et al. 2016). Mo intake
and blood concentration presumably control the activities of the Mo enzymes in
some health disorders. We have tried to collect all the information available for Mo


-----

7 Molybdenum 191

concentrations in blood. We have collected data from 17 and 4 studies for serum

and whole blood concentrations, respectively, determined in Japan, China, Israel,
Croatia, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, Poland, Sweden, Norway, France,
Canada, Mexico, and Venezuela, (with ~5000 subjects). Since most of the studies
checked Mo serum concentrations, we calculated an average of all the available data,
assuming that the 4 studies would not significantly affect the resultant average value.
We attained an average concentration of 1.08 ng/mL (10.9 nM), the mode, the lowest,
and the highest average concentrations being 0.81, 0.4, and 3.8 ng/mL, respectively.
The Mayo Clinic Laboratories might well represent the US Mo concentration values
with an average of 0.43 ng/mL, a normal range for whole blood of 0.6–4 ng/mL, and
a normal range for serum of 0.3–2 ng/mL (Mayo Clinic 2017).
###### **7.9 Mo Excretion**

Mo retention and turnover are regulated by urinary excretion, and excess Mo is
rapidly excreted in the urine. At high levels, at the range of 100–1500 μg/d, almost
all of the Mo was excreted in the urine. At this range of administration, plasma
concentration increases linearly from 0.6 to 4.4 ng/mL (Hays et al. 2016). An increase
in the dietary Mo results in its more rapid turnover of the body’s Mo stores. This
was demonstrated by the data on total Mo excretion and the excretion of both oral
and intravenous tracers. When dietary intake was very low, ~60% of total Mo was
excreted via urine. When the dietary intake increased, >90% of the total Mo was
excreted via urine (Institute of Medicine 2000).
Urine is the predominant route of elimination, with upwards of 90% of an oral dose
being eliminated via urine with a half-life of less than 12 h. In plasma, elimination
has been described with a biexponential function with mean half-lives of 0.5 and
6.6 h, respectively (Hays et al. 2016).
Mo urinal excretion highly fluctuates between individuals. In 10% of 35 Japanese
male adults, Mo excretion was <0.2 ng/L while in 10% of the subjects at the higher
level of excretion, it was >3 ng/mL (Yoshida et al. 2006). In the US, the average
concentration of urinary Mo is 69 μg/L (Institute of Medicine 2000), a value that
might reflect an average daily intake of 76 μg/d for females and 109 μg/d for males
(Institute of Medicine 2000).
In premature infants and young men, isotope studies confirm efficient absorption
and urinary excretion increasing in parallel (Disease Month 2004). Transitioning of
Mointakefrom22to72 μg/dresultedintriplingofthefractionofplasmaMoexcreted
into urine. Further transitioning from 121 to 467 μg/d resulted in an additional
doubling of fractional transfer of plasma Mo into urine (Novotny and Turnlund 2007).
Because urine Mo is highly related to plasma level and Mo intake, urine Mo reflects
plasma/serum Mo concentration (Hays et al. 2016). The fraction of Mo excreted in
the urine is very different from that of most minerals. Extremely small amounts of
copper are eliminated in the urine, and under usual conditions, the amount does not


-----

192 Y. Dror and F. Stern

vary with dietary intake. More zinc is excreted in the urine, but this is also a small
fraction of dietary intake (Turnlund et al. 1995).
###### **7.10 Food Sources**

Typical intakes of Mo are probably in the range of 1.5–2.5 μg/kg/d per body weight.
An average dietary Mo content in representative total diets from 11 countries was
230 μg/kg/d of dry matter (WHO 1996). High variation is expected for Mo intake,
because Mo content in food is highly affected by soil and water concentrations (Institute of Medicine 2000; O’Connor et al. 2001; Smedley et al. 2014). The following
food Mo concentrations have been collected, μg/kg: pulses, 2.5; cereals, excluding
wheat, 1.5; wheat, 0.3; milk, 0.26; eggs, 0.18; fruits, 0.13; fish, 0.12; vegetables,
0.08; sugar, 0.08; meat, 0.07; and oil, 0 (Rajagopalan 1988; Ali et al. 2014). The
main contributors of Mo in North American diet are legumes, grain products and
nuts (Hays et al. 2016). The content of Mo in foods as published in a German list
varies from 10 to 6000 μg/kg dry matter: cereal products, sugar- and starch-rich food,
luxury food, bread, rolls, cake, spices and most kinds of fruits, 10–400 μg/kg dry
matter. Vegetable foodstuffs as part of mixed diets in Germany deliver 70% of the
human intake, animal foodstuffs about 20% and beverages less than 10% (Anke et al.
2007). The Mo contributors of the daily Japanese menu containing 225 μg/d, % are:
rice, 45; pulses, 29; vegetable and fruits, 11; wheat, 4; eggs, 6; and fish, 5 (Hattori
et al. 2004). In Cameroon, the Mo contributors in the daily intake of 195 μg/d, %
are: cereals and cereal products, 30; tubers and starches, 8; fruits, vegetables and
oilseeds, 49; and beverages, 6 (Gimou et al. 2014).
The Western diet contains 200–500 μg/d of Mo (Abumrad 1984). The following
daily intakes have been collected μg/d: Britain, 130; US, 330 (range of 210–460); and
New Zealand, 46–96 (Chappell et al. 1979). Most natural waters contain low levels of
Mo, in the range of 2–3 μg/L (Barceloux 1999). Legumes contain symbiotic nitrogen
binding bacteria called rhizobia, which produce nitrogen compounds that help the
plant to grow and compete with other plants (Thrall et al. 2011). Mo is essential for
microbial nitrogen assimilation due to its presence in nitrogenase (Glass et al. 2012).
Probably, beans contain the highest Mo concentrations of all foodstuffs (Seifert et al.
2007). However, there are very high variations in Mo concentrations between land
areas, bean species, varieties, and seasons (Ojeda et al. 2015; Nobile et al. 2016;
O’Connor et al. 2001). **7.11 Mo-Tungsten Interaction**

Mo and tungsten (symbol W, atomic number 96, and atomic weight 184) enzymes
show common structural features, with the metal being bound by a pyranopterindithiolene cofactor called molybdopterin and tungstopterin, respectively. They are


-----

7 Molybdenum 193

also similar in functional aspects. Mo is in many ways the twin element of tungsten.
However, tungsten does not act as a catalytic metal in animals, but only in microorganisms (Holm et al. 2011; Pushie et al. 2014; Bevers et al. 2009). In animals,
tungsten competes with Mo and occasionally induces Mo deficiency. In bacteria,
there are cases in which tungsten has been successfully substituted for Mo, although
sometimes with a change in pH activity profile (Holm et al. 2011). Tungsten concentration remarkably affects Mo activity in bacteria. However, humans are strictly
dependent on the availability of Mo, while they are independent of tungsten (Bevers
et al. 2009).
###### **7.12 Mo Deficiency and Congenital Metabolic Defects**

Mo is characterized by extremely rare episodes of deficiency. The two known phenomena are an episode of a long-term total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and very rare
episodes of congenital error in Mo enzymes and Moco. The patient on TPN presented
with symptoms of amino acid intolerance, irritability, coma, hypermethioninemia,
increased urinary xanthine and sulfite and decreased urinary uric acid and sulfate.
These abnormalities were alleviated after the patients were administered TPN containing Mo concentrations of 19, 47.5 and 190 μg/d (Stehle et al. 2016).
Moco deficiency is a rare severe autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism
that leads to the deficiency of the reducing component of all Mo enzymes (SO, XOR,
AO, and mARC). The resultant accumulation of sulfite, taurine, S-sulfocysteine and
thiosulfate contributes to the severe neurological impairment (Atwal and Scaglia
2016). The incidence is estimated between 1 in 100,000–200,000 live births, and
over 100 patients from multiple ethnic groups have been identified worldwide. Congenital metabolic defects caused by Moco deficiency are characterized by a neonatal
presentation of intractable seizures, feeding difficulties, severe developmental delay,
microcephaly with brain atrophy and coarse facial features.
Biochemical symptoms of Moco deficiency are elevated levels of xanthine, hypoxanthine and sulfites, low levels or non-detectable levels of uric acid and elevated levels
of *S* -sulfocysteine in plasma and urine. Furthermore, urothione, the Moco degradation product, is absent in the urine of Moco-deficient patients. Most infants die in
early childhood; those who survive the neonatal period have a profound developmental delay, with abnormal tone, ocular lens dislocation, dramatic and progressive
loss of white matter in the brain. Most of the clinical findings observed in patients
are attributable to the loss of SO activity and the subsequent neurotoxic effect of
sulfite accumulation. Moco and SO deficiencies are clinically indistinguishable and
only biochemical and genetic tests can differentiate between these two disorders
(Jakubiczka et al. 2016).

###### **7.13 Mo Toxicity** ***7.13.1 Mo Toxicity in Humans***

As the tinniest essential trace element (with established RDA) in the human body,
Mo is highly affected by the concentrations of other essential and nonessential trace
metals. The chemical toxicity of a given element is related to its interactions with the
biochemical processes in the human body. Some of these interactions may be beneficial or even essential, whereas others may be detrimental. Even moderate concentrations of nonessential elements, such as aluminum, nickel, titanium and uranium,
might be strong competitors of essential elements in the biochemical process and can
influence general human health. Pollution has a large impact on the accumulation
rate of toxic elements in the human body (Zeneli et al. 2015).
Symptoms of toxicity were exhibited by humans exposed to environmental contamination, such as intake of 10–15 mg/d of Mo, resulting in gout-like symptoms
associated with high blood concentrations of Mo, uric acid, and xanthine. It was also
reported that an intake of 0.54 mg/d of dietary Mo resulted in significant urinary
copper losses (Freeland-Graves and Turnlund 1996). ***7.13.2 Mo Effect on Copper Metabolism***

Mo metabolism is related to copper and sulfur metabolism. Mo salts are capable of
inhibiting the absorption of iron and copper and the formation of copper molybdate or
thiomolybdate compounds. Copper generally has a beneficial effect on the symptoms
caused by excessive Mo concentration. Mo affects copper utilization, and increased
Mo intake results in copper depletion (Chappell et al. 1979). Because Mo toxicity is
associated with depleted copper stores, humans with an inadequate intake of dietary
copper could be at greater risk of Mo toxicity (Vyskoˇcil and Viau 1999). ***7.13.3 Mo Toxicity in Plants***

Dicotyledonous species generally are less tolerant to excess Mo than are the monocotyledonous species (Gupta and Gupta 1998). Fertilizers for leguminous plants
incorporate Mo salts, and standard commercial fertilizers contain approximately
2–6 mg/kg (Barceloux 1999). Mo is particularly important for microbial nitrogen
assimilation due to its presence in nitrogenase, the enzyme that performs N 2 fixation, and in nitrate reductase, the enzyme that performs the first step in nitrate (NO 3 [−] )
assimilation, reduction of NO 3 [−] to nitrite (NO 2 [−] ). N 2 fixation requires more Mo than
NO 3 [−] assimilation, while other more chemically-reduced forms of N, such as NH 4 [+],
do not require Mo for assimilation (Glass et al. 2012).

7 Molybdenum 195
###### ***7.13.4 Mo Toxicity in Animals***

Ruminants are more sensitive to Mo than monogastric animals, but the basis for the
toxicity of Mo in ruminants is not relevant for humans (Institute of Medicine 2000).
In a decreasing order, the following animals are sensitive to high Mo intake: sheep,
pigs, rats, guinea pigs and poultry (Chappell et al. 1979). Mo toxicity in ruminants
has been observed in many locations. Generally, where such symptoms are observed,
the feed contains 6–36 mg/kg of Mo (Miller and Engel 1960). The rumen is the site
of significant interactions between copper, sulfur and Mo. It also shows reactions
between copper, sulfur, and iron. The interaction between Mo and sulfur results
in the formation of thiomolybdates, which readily bind copper and in the absence
of adequate quantities of rumen copper are absorbed into the animal and bind to
copper in plasma and other tissues. This is the cause of thiomolybdate toxicity, often
misleadingly called copper deficiency. Another interaction between iron, sulfur and
copper, might intensify the thiomolybdate problem by making copper unavailable to
bind to the thiomolybdates (Gould and Kendall 2011). **7.14 Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL)**

The UL for Mo was set by the IOM as 2 mg/d (Institute of Medicine 2000), an
amount that is ~45 times the suggested intake for adults. The UL refers to the highest
level of daily nutrient intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects
for almost all individuals in the general population. Since human studies are limited
in their scale and most limited in observations of excess metal consumption that is
far above the suggested intake, animal experimentation was the main basis for UL
evaluation. The UL for Mo is based on adverse reproductive effects in rats fed high
levels of the mineral (Institute of Medicine 2000). A negative effect of Mo excessive
consumption on animals cannot serve as a basis for establishing UL in humans. **7.15 Saturation of the Mo Enzymes**

Metalloenzymes, such as XOR, must bind ionic metal for their activity and must be
saturated by the ionic metal for their maximal activity. In the mouse fibroblastic cell
line, the highest XOR activity was observed at the Mo concentration of ~20 mM
(1800 μg/mL) with about a linear increase from zero concentration to 10 mM Mo.
Within the data we have collected, the average Mo concentration in the human serum
is 0.0014 μg/mL, and in human liver, 0.73 μg/g. The concentrations in these two
tissues are far below the Mo saturation level as measured in mouse fibroblastic cell
line for XOR (Falciani et al. 1994). In a rat experiment, tissue Mo concentrations
dramatically responded to the dietary Mo and reached the plateaus at various levels


-----

196 Y. Dror and F. Stern

of dietary Mo. When dietary Mo increased, Mo concentrations in the liver increased
up to 200 μg Mo/kg diet level. Beyond this level, no further increase in tissue concentration occurred. Supplementation up to 50 μg/kg diet almost doubled the hepatic
SO activity relative to the activity in the group fed the basal diet. Further supplementation of dietary Mo did not have a significant additional effect on the activity.
The results suggest that the activities of the Mo-enzymes reflect the concentrations
of dietary Mo and may be useful in the assessment of the nutritional status of Mo
(Wang et al. 1991). Since Mo enzymes have a major effect on drug metabolism, Mo
intake might have a critical role in the drug pharmacokinetics.
The information presented for the Mo enzyme saturation by the Mo ion is quite
limited for such a critical issue regarding the possible effect of Mo on the drug
pharmacokinetics (Falciani et al. 1994). The effect of Mo enzyme saturation on drug
metabolism might justify an examination of the impact of the Mo intake on the
drug pharmacokinetics. Fluctuations in Mo intake, such as in the case of traveling to
another country, might change the Mo tissue concentration and increase or decrease
the rate of the drug degradation. In critical morbidity, such an outcome might have
a harmful effect.
###### **7.16 The Effect of Mo Enzymes on Drug Metabolism**

Hepatic clearance plays a key role in determining the systemic exposure of drugs
and metabolites, which in turn has a major effect on variability in the beneficial and
adverse effects of medications. Aging results in a number of significant changes in the
human liver, including reductions in liver blood flow, liver size, drug-metabolizing
enzyme content, and pseudocapillarization. Drug metabolism is also influenced by
comorbid disease, frailty, concomitant medicines, and epigenetics. These changes
have the potential to alter the hepatic clearance of drugs. There is a growing evidence
that the age-related changes in the liver not only result in a decrease in the hepatic
clearance of unbound drugs, but also influence variability in response to medications in older people. Misinterpretation of these age-related changes in total hepatic
clearance could lead to recommendations to actually increase the dose rate in older
people, whereas the unbound clearance is decreased, leading to a considerable risk
of toxicity (McLachlan and Pont 2012).
Mo enzymes are only a minor part of the drug degradation system, but because
of their extensive activity in drug decomposition, their fluctuating activities might
deteriorate the pharmacokinetics of many drugs. Metabolites generated by the drug
metabolizing enzymes can be pharmacologically active, and reactive metabolites
formed during bioactivation might cause toxicity (Di 2014). Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence hepatic metabolism in older people is critical to allow individualization of drug and dose selection for older people,
and thus achieve optimal outcomes for this patient population (McLachlan and Pont
2012).

###### **7.17 Increased Medication Intake**

The striking effect of Mo enzymes on drug metabolism has a particular impact on
the elderly people, because this population segment consume medications at a much
higher rate than any other subgroup in the population. With the general trend of
increase in longevity, the marked increase in the old adult population, the expansion
of the pharma industry, and the increased role of the medications in our life quality
and longevity, there is a continuous increase in the medication intake worldwide
(Gransjön et al. 2017). In the US NHANES, 51% of the adults reported use of any
drug, and a significant increase of about 0.68%/year in overall prescription drug
use and polypharmacy were observed. These increases persisted after accounting for
changes in the age distribution of the population. The prevalence of prescription drug
use increased in the majority of, but not all, drug classes (Kantor et al. 2015).
In Germany, the proportion of antihypertensive drugs use among adults with
hypertension significantly increased over time from 53.8% in 1998 to 71.6% in
2008–2011 (Sarganas et al. 2016). In Sweden, medication use increased from 1987
to 2007 for both genders and in all age groups; in the age group 78 year, from 2.8
drugs in 1987 to 5.8 drugs in 2007, and corresponding figures for the age group
>96 year was from 3.6 to 7.7 (Gransjön et al. 2017). In the elderly population in
Israel, an increased intake of medications was observed with advanced age. At least
one medication a day was routinely prescribed by a physician in ~81% of subjects
aged 65–74 year and in ~94% of subjects aged >75 year (Brodsky et al. 2007). **7.18 The Advantage of Lower Mo Concentrations in Some** **Health Disorders**

We have collected some information showing the advantage of the lower Mo concentrations over its higher concentrations in type 2 diabetes and spermatogenesis.
Elevated incidence of type 2 diabetes and impaired spermatogenesis disorders might
become biomarkers for the major health burdens, such as high incidence of other
non-communicable diseases (NCDs), mortality, and disability. ***7.18.1 Type 2 Diabetes***

Some limited information has suggested a relationship between type 2 diabetes and
higher serum Mo. In a small study conducted in Mexico, higher serum Mo concentrations were found in diabetic patients compared to healthy controls. Mo concentrations
in serum tended to be elevated in diabetic patients as referred to control subjects and
significantly increased in severe complications as compared to slight-to-moderate
concentration groups. Serum Mo concentrations correlated directly with several


-----

198 Y. Dror and F. Stern

parameters characterizing the progress of diabetes. In patients with severe complications elevated serum Mo concentrations were closely associated with nephropathy,
neuropathy, serum creatinine and urine total proteins, and glycosylated hemoglobin.
It remains uncertain why serum Mo presented a tendency toward higher concentrations in diabetic patients versus healthy individuals and was significantly increased
in severe versus slight-to-moderate complications. It is also unclear how Mo–sulfur
species required for Cu chelating are generated in diabetic patients (Flores et al.
2011). In the NHANES 1999–2010, Mo was consistently positively associated with
diabetes prevalence; a much lower relative risk for diabetes was found for urinary Mo
excretion at the 1st quartile than at the 2nd to the 4th quartiles;.also, higher quartiles
of Mo were associated with greater homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) values
of insulin resistance (Menke et al. 2016).
In a small group of obese patients with gestational diabetes visiting prenatal clinic
at the Maternity Hospital in Kuwait, a slightly elevated level but still significant of
blood Mo concentration was observed (Al-Saleh et al. 2007). In a study conducted
in Tehran in type 2 diabetic females aged 35–55 year, hair Mo content was higher
by 33% than in the control. Similarly, hair cadmium, copper, aluminum, and lead
concentrations were elevated in these females (Tadayon et al. 2012). An in vitro
study, suggests that Mo is capable of inducing toxicological effects in pancreatic
β-cells that result in dysfunction and apoptosis (Yang et al. 2016). Because type
2 diabetes is of major health concern worldwide, the association between Mo and
diabetes should attract the attention of the health authorities in each country.
The practice of Mo incorporation into ‘multivitamins’ has never been supported
by robust data and presumably has never been supported by any data. Mo deficiency
has never been shown, except for in one patient on a long-term TPN and in the
very rare cases of congenital diseases (Abumrad et al. 1981). Therefore, it would be
prudent to consider the possibility of Mo free ‘multivitamins’ for diabetic patients.
###### ***7.18.2 Impaired Human Spermatogenesis and Lower*** ***Testosterone Levels***

Exposure to environmental contaminants rather than genetic defects accounts for the
defects in reproductive functions. Heavy metals are found to increase the reactive
oxygen species leading to oxidative stress, induce DNA damage and cause apoptosis
of sperm cells with the ability to disrupt blood-testis-barrier and affect spermatogenesis events. Semen analyses are conducted worldwide in infertility infirmaries with
some routinely available parameters for its quality. The major effects observed are the
decrease in sperm count, the abnormal increase in sperm counts, sperm DNA damage, and impaired sperm motility. Except for lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, and
aluminum, essential elements also affect semen quality (Jenardhanan et al. 2016). In
a study conducted in two Michigan infertility clinics, the investigators found signif

-----

7 Molybdenum 199

icant or suggestive associations and dose-dependent trends between blood Mo and
declined sperm concentration and morphology (Meeker et al. 2008).
Compared with Mo levels at the lower range, the middle and high Mo levels
(70th to 85th percentile and >85th percentile, respectively) were associated with 23
and 60 ng/dL reductions in testosterone levels, respectively. Mo concentration was
also associated with a significant inverse trend in free androgen index (Meeker et al.
2017).
###### ***7.18.3 Bone Mineral Density***

Bone mineral density (BMD) is a noninvasive measure of bone health that depends
on peak bone mass reached in adolescence and subsequent bone loss. BMD is lower
in women than men and decreases substantially with age in both genders, leading to
complications such as osteoporosis, which increases the risk of subsequent fractures.
In an analysis, which used publicly-available data derived from the US NHANES
2007–2010, there was a statistically significant inverse association between urine Mo
and lumbar spine BMD among 50 to >80 year women. Similarly, there was a statistically significant dose-dependent decrease in lumbar spine BMD with increasing
urine Mo quartiles among these women from the lowest to the highest quartile. The
potential biological mechanisms through which Mo may act to influence BMD have
not been identified or even largely explored, but it is plausible that this trace element
may disrupt levels of steroid sex hormones, which are necessary for promoting and
maintaining bone health. Notably, early animal studies have shown that Mo may
influence normal bone development through its antagonistic relationship with copper. Additionally, since bone tissue serves as a reserve for minerals, such as Mo, it is
possible that the inverse association between urine Mo and BMD observed in older
women might be due to the release of Mo from bone demineralization associated
with aging (Lewis et al. 2016). ***7.18.4 Liver Malfunction***

In an analysis, which used publicly-available data derived from the US NHANES
2007–2010, participants who reported liver problems had increased creatinineadjusted levels of Mo in their urine. The hepatotoxicity of the metal has been observed
in a few animal studies after chronic Mo exposure and the mechanism was thought to
be an induction of fatty changes in the liver. However, no convincing epidemiologic
studies in humans have confirmed the findings observed in animals (Mendy et al.
2012).

###### ***7.18.5 Susceptibility of Jurkat Cells to Metal Concentrations***

Jurkat cells are human T-helper lymphocytes that enable in vitro measurement of
cell viability under stress conditions induced by foreign antigens or elevated concentrations of metals. Exposure in vitro of an isolated cell to ion metals, including Mo
showed adverse effects on some of the studied parameters, such as DNA damage,
apoptosis, viability, and proliferation inhibition. The average concentration to cause
a harmful outcome was lower for Mo than for zirconium, beryllium, chromium, aluminum, and iron (Caicedo et al. 2007). This study shows that ion metals might exert
harmful effects on some sensitive cellular activities even at concentrations that are

essential for normal biochemical activities, and that Mo does not behave as an inert

ion even at low concentrations. **7.19 U-Shaped Curves and Nadir Values**

Presently, no U-shaped curves are available for the effect of Mo concentrations on the
relative risk of morbidity and mortality. The scope of blood (serum/plasma) determinations is very limited, and no consensus has been reached for the optimal cut-off
points for Mo intake or blood concentration. The public health services and medical
teams worldwide are not aware of the advantage of adjusting optimal serum Mo
levels according to the relative risk of morbidity and mortality. However, presently,
nobody knows what are the optimal Mo concentrations and the optimal Mo intake,
and even no motivation arises to assay Mo levels. Thus, no research funds are invested
in the determination of Mo optimal concentrations. In the absence of available data
for establishing the optimal intake (Otten et al. 2006), which determines blood concentrations, no nadir value has been established for Mo blood concentrations. **7.20 Mo Supplementation**

The available data for the recommended intake of 45 μg/d and of the UL of
1100–2000 μg/d (Institute of Medicine 2000) is not supported by robust data (Hays
et al. 2016). For most nutrients the recommended intake is actually based on an average intake without any physiological endpoint (Yetley et al. 2016). The Mo intake
highly depends on the diet type (generally higher Mo intake is found in a vegetarian
diet) and on the land area (the higher the soil content the higher the intake). Mo intake
in the studies widely varied between societies and land areas. The following data have
been collected μg/d: in Germany: mixed diet, 95, vegetarian diet, 175; in Mexico,
185 (Holzinger et al. 1998); in the US adults, 160 (Hunt and Meachen 2001); in
another US study, 120–240 μg/d (Tsongas et al. 1980); in Japan, 225 (Hattori et al.
2004); in Belgium food survey, 87 (Van Cauwenbergh et al. 1997). A median of


-----

7 Molybdenum 201

150 μg/d, with extreme values of 928 in China, 523 in India and 58 in Germany, was
calculated from 21 observations in 11 countries (Van Cauwenbergh et al. 1997).
It might be suggested that for the majority of the people, Mo intake exceeds the
optimal level. This is claimed in the light of the data found for the disadvantage
of the higher percentiles of Mo intake, the higher urine excretion and the higher
Mo blood concentrations found in in vitro and some human studies. Since Mo intake

mainly depends on soil content, the ability to optimize Mo status is limited. However,
legumes, particularly beans, comprise the main source of Mo intake (Seifert et al.
2007). Monitoring of beans intake might substantially decrease Mo intake. Presently,
the information presented here does not support any suggestion of intake for the
general population. However, for diabetic patients we cannot ignore the data shown
here. In the absence of contradictory information, there is no need to incorporate Mo
in any ‘multivitamin’ supplement for this group of patients. Monitoring Mo intake
by decreasing beans intake or by consuming beans with a low Mo content should be
considered.

Mo content at a range of 20 μg/d for TPN adult patients suggested by ESPEN
sounds reasonable. Presently, the TPN formulas contain a very high content of Mo.
In extensive surveys of enteral formulas and TPN for the adults, the Mo content was
the second highest among all the other micronutrients and was higher far above the
ESPEN recommendations (Iacone et al. 2016; Stehle et al. 2016).
###### **7.21 The Present State of Mo Research**

We have presented here some crucial nutritional issues regarding Mo.

A. What should be the optimal Mo intake?
B. What is the nutritional status of the Mo in various societies?

C. Is the present practice of Mo supplementation or Mo incorporation in nutritional
formulas justified?
D. What is the relationship between serum Mo and the pharmacokinetics of drugs,
and in particular the relationship between serum Mo and the pharmacokinetics
of drugs for chronic diseases?

The available data on these critical issues is most limited. Moreover, the nutritional
research of Mo is most limited. The number of topic items for “molybdenum intake”
for the year 2015 is on decreasing trend in comparison to other microelements and
to the former years. The number of “metal intake” topics for the year 2015 for zinc,
iron, copper, iodine, and selenium lay at the range of 130–400 for each metal, while
for molybdenum only 11 items were found (Web of Science). Thus, an extensive
study of Mo role in human nutrition is required.

##### **Chapter 8**
#### **Water and Sodium Balance Disorders** **in Aging**

**Massimo Boemi and Maria Paola Luconi**

**Abstract** The elderly population is growing rapidly and people with more than
60 years is increasing faster than adults of any younger decades. The mechanisms
involved in water and sodium metabolism are complex and change with age; they
include vasopressin system, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the
action of the natriuretic peptides. Fluid and sodium balance is generally conserved
but this homeostasis could be lost due to illness conditions (physical and/or cognitive)
and some pharmacological treatments. Consequently, the serum sodium imbalance
is one of the most common finding in clinical practice and a major cause of hospital admissions. Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are defined respectively as serum
sodium level <135 and >145 mmol/l. Both electrolyte disorders are associated with
high morbidity and mortality in humans as well as in animals. At the same time,
they are potentially preventable, thus an early diagnosis with the recognition of the
underlying causes and a proper management may avoid negative outcomes. This
chapter attempts to provide an overview on the age-related changes in the peripheral
and central mechanisms that regulate water and sodium homeostasis in humans and
animal models. It will describe the clinical manifestations of dehydration and volume overload and it will address the current challenges in diagnosis and treatment
of hyponatremia and hypernatremia.

Aging is associated with changes in the complex systems that regulate water
and sodium homeostasis in both humans and animals: hypothalamic vasopressin
secretion, thirst perception and kidney function. In particular, some structural and
functional renal changes have been described with aging; they lead to a reduced
ability to concentrate or dilute urine (Cowen et al. 2013; Muntner 2009; Koch and
Fulop 2017). Moreover, intheelderlythefunctional andcognitivedeclinemayreduce
the ability to assume a proper amount of water or communicate its need (Koch and
Fulop 2017; Phillips et al. 1991).
Plasma osmolality is normally maintained within an extremely narrow range of
variation. Hypo-osmolar and hyper-osmolar states are conditions respectively due to
an excess and a deficiency of body water relative to body solute. Because the sodium
is the main constituent of extracellular (and plasma) osmolality, hypo-osmolar and
hyper-osmolar states generally reflect changes in sodium concentration and correspond with hyponatremia and hypernatremia (Verbalis 2003; Adler and Verbalis
2006; Anderson et al. 1985).
A great number of potential causes of sodium imbalance is recognized, as well as
a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from the absence of symptoms
to severe neurological signs (Spasovski et al. 2014; Kim 2006). Hyponatremia and
hypernatremia are both associated with increased morbidity, length of hospitalization
and mortality; a proper assessment with the research of underlying causes represent
a challenge for clinicians (Liamis et al. 2013; Wald et al. 2010; Snyder et al. 1987;
Palevsky et al. 1996).
###### **8.2 Water Homeostasis in Humans: Mechanisms** **and Age-Related Changes**

The body of healthy adults has constituted by water for about 55–65%; this percentage decreases proportionally with age because of the typical changes of senescence,
in particular the reduction of water-rich tissues (such as muscle mass). Water exerts
many functions: structural, carrying (for nutrients and toxics), thermoregulatory (to
maintain body temperature stable during changes of external temperature) and regulatory in chemical reactions (such as hydrolysis reaction) (Verbalis 2003).
Approximately55–65%oftotalbodywater(TBW)iscontainedintheintracellular
fluid (ICF), and the other 35–45% in the extracellular compartments (ECF). The
latter is divided between the interstitial fluid (about three quarters of the total) and
intravascular fluid or blood volume (the other one quarter). Biological membranes are
semipermeable, namely freely permeable to water but not to aqueous solutes. Water
shifts across cell membrane from a compartment with a lower solute concentration to
another with a higher one, until the osmotic pressure (a function of the concentration
of all the solutes in a compartment) has been equalized on both sides. The membranebound Na [+] /K [+] pumps maintain Na [+] in a primarily extracellular location and K [+]

in a primarily intracellular location, so ICF and ECF differ consistently in solute
composition, but their osmotic pressure is equivalent (Verbalis 2003; Fanestil 1994).
The osmolality is defined as the concentration of all the solutes in a given weight
water. Plasma osmolality can be measured directly or estimated with the following
formula:

Plasma Osmolality ∼ 275−295 mOsm/KgH 2 O

� 1863 × Serum Na [+] (mmol/l) + [Glucose (m] [g] [/dl)] + [Glucose (m] [g] [/dl)]

18 2 *.* 8

*BU N* � *Bread Urea Nitrogen*

Of all solutes, those impermeable to cell membranes (such as, Na [+] and mannitol)
are “effective solutes”; they create osmotic pressure gradients leading to the shift of
water between ICF and ECF compartments. On the contrary, the solutes permeable
to cell membranes (such as, urea and ethanol) are “ineffective solutes”, not able to
create an osmotic pressure gradient. Glucose has a double action: at physiological
plasma concentrations, it acts as an ineffective solute and it is moved through the
membranes by active transport mechanisms, on the contrary, when augmented (i.e.
in case of insulin deficiency and impaired tissue uptake), it becomes an effective
extracellular solute (Verbalis 2001; Vokes et al. 1987).
Under physiological condition, the human body maintains plasma osmolality
and serum sodium concentration within an extremely narrow range, respectively
275–295 mOsm/Kg H 2 O and 135–145 mmol/L (mEq/L), to avoid osmoticallyinduced cellular dysfunction. The water metabolism depends on the interaction of
central and peripheral mechanisms involving three principal sites: the hypothalamus,
the center of thirst and the kidney (Spasovski et al. 2014).
###### ***8.2.1 Osmoreceptive Neurons, Baroreceptors and Arginine*** ***Vasopressin (AVP)***

The osmoreceptive neurons are located in the anterior hypothalamus; they are sensible to changes of cell stretch due to variation of effective plasma osmolality. A
decrease in cell stretch (cell dehydrated) in response to increased plasma osmolality (or tonicity) triggers their firing activity and lead to both augmented thirst and
secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP) (Spasovski et al. 2014).
AVP, also called anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), is a nine-amino-acid peptide produced by magnocellular neurons located in the hypothalamic supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei (3rd ventricle). After synthesis, AVP is transported to the bloodstream
through the axon terminals located in the posterior pituitary. It exerts an anti-diuretic
action by regulating water permeability of the nephron. AVP binds vasopressin-2
(V2) receptors and determines the insertion of aquaporin-2 water channels (AQP2)
into the apical surface of the collecting duct principal cells. By the action of these


-----

channels, free water is re-absorbed and a more concentrated urine is excreted (Knepper 1997). Usually, an increase in plasma osmolality as small as 1–2% is enough
to increase the plasma vasopressin concentration of 1 pg/ml. Maximum antidiuresis
is obtained in presence of ADH concentrations above 5 pg/ml (Wong and Verbalis
2002).
Baroreceptors are stretch-sensitive receptors located in carotid sinus, left atrium,
aorticarch, pulmonaryveins andlargearteries. Their dischargeratedecreases concordantly with the reduction of effective circulating volume, stimulating the release of
ADH and the activity of efferent symphatetic nerve (vasoconstriction and increase
in heart rate). A reduction in blood pressure of at least 5% is required to elicit
the increase of serum vasopressin concentration; in case of worsening circulatory
hypovolaemia, vasopressin concentration dramatically increases and baroregulation
overrides the osmoregulatory system (Spasovski et al. 2014; Baylis 1983).
AVP may also be released in response to pathological conditions, such as pain,
nausea, medications, endogenous stimulus (acetylcholine, histamine, dopamine,
prostaglandins, bradykinin, neuropeptide Y, angiotensin I) or medications. On the
contrary, its release is inhibited by nitric oxide, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and
opioids. (Adler and Verbalis 2006; Schlanger et al. 2010). Schwartz WB and Bartter
FC defined this condition as “syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion” (SIADH). Now the term “syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis” (SIAD) is
preferred because it includes the increase of water permeability in the collecting duct
due to genetic factors or drugs (vasopressin-independent) (Spasovski et al. 2014;
Schwartz et al. 1957).
###### ***8.2.2 Thirst***

Thirst is the stimulus of water ingestion in response to the perception of body fluids
deficit. Thirst center is located near the hypothalamic osmoreceptors. It is elicited, in
humans and animals, by an increase in the extracellular fluid osmolality (with secondary reduction in intracellular volume) or by an intravascular hypovolaemia (with
secondary reduction in extracellular volume) (Verbalis 2003). Studies in humans
have described that a minimum increase in plasma osmolality above basal levels
may produce the sensation of thirst, conversely a greater threshold of blood volume
depletion (hypovolaemia and hypotension) is needed for producing thirst (Robertson 1983; Thompson et al. 1986). This minor response to baroreceptor activity is
probably a result of human adaptation to blood fluctuations, such as the orthostatic
pooling of blood in the lower body during erect posture (Verbalis 2003).
Thirstandsodiumappetitearealsoregulatedbyhormonalsignallingsystems,such
as the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in presence of
hypovolaemia and hypotension (Phillips et al. 1985).
Under normal physiological conditions, the threshold for releasing vasopressin
(and subsequent antidiuresis) is lower than that for triggering thirst; the osmotic
threshold for thirst is about 5–10 mOsm/Kg H 2 O lower than for ADH secretion


-----

(Knepper 1997). The intake of water is generally in excess of true ‘need’. When it
is inadequate to supply body needs, even in the presence of AVP-induced maximal
antidiuresis, plasma osmolality rises to levels able to stimulate thirst and produce
water intake proportional to the elevation of osmolality. Thirst is a defence behaviour
essential when pituitary and renal mechanisms are insufficient to maintain plasma
osmolality within a narrow range and to avoid dehydration (Verbalis 2003).
###### ***8.2.3 Kidney and Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System*** ***(RAAS)***

The mechanism by which the kidney produce maximum urine osmolality is complex
and depends on many factors: vasopressin stimulus, renal blood flow and glomerular
filtration rate (GFR), solute load, sodium and urea transporters, water channels (or
aquaporins) functions. The countercurrent configuration of the loops of Henle creates
a gradient of solutes from the cortex to the medulla via the re-absorption of both
sodium and urea from the lumen; this system is essential in order to concentrate the
urine (Schlanger et al. 2010). The maximum medullary gradient is reached in case
of dehydration (~1.200 mOsm/L) (Gottschalk and Mylle 1958).
Thirteen aquaporins (AQPs) have been identified. AQP1 is a constitutive
vasopressin-independent water channel located on the apical and basolateral membranes in the proximal convoluting tubules (PCT), on the thin descending limb of the
loop of Henle (tDL), and on the endothelium of the descending vasa recta. The PCT
is responsible for the re-absorption of 60% of the glomerular ultrafiltrate, whereas the
tDL is essential in maintaining the countercurrent multiplier. AQP3 and AQP4 are
constitutively active and located on the basolateral membrane. Studies have shown
a greater expression of AQP3 in the presence of ADH. Finally, AQP2, as described
above, is a vasopressin-dependent water channel located in the apical membrane of
collecting tubules. (Agre 2006; Knepper 1994).
RAAS is a hormonal system strictly involved in water and salt homeostasis. In
response to hypovolaemia and ECF depletion this system activates and elicits thirst
(Abdelaal et al. 1976). An effective volume depletion induces at kidney level the
secretion of renin from the juxtaglomerular apparatus, via both a reduction in renal
perfusion pressure and an increase in the sympathetic nervous system activity, with
secondary elevation of circulating levels of Angiotensin II (Ang II) (Fitzsimons
1998). The latter one generates the sensation of thirst sending signals to the median
preoptic region of the hypothalamus (Simpson 1981).
Aldosterone is an adrenal mineralocorticoid hormone, primarily secreted in
response to elevation of Ang II, but also stimulated by high serum potassium concentrations. In tubular epithelial cells of the distal nephron, aldosterone binds mineralocorticoid receptors (MR), increases sodium re-absorption and sodium-potassium
exchange by enhancing the synthesis and activity of ion channels, in particular the
epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) (Masilamani et al. 1999) Aldosterone is inhib

ited by the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and by hyperosmolality. Moreover, other
natriuretic factors may override its effects through a phenomenon known as “escape
from mineralcorticoids”, in which sodium balance is re-established after a period of
sodium retention and ECF expansion (Schneider et al. 1985).
###### ***8.2.4 Natriuretic Peptides***

Natriuretic peptides are three endogenous hormones, atrial (ANP), brain (BNP) and
C-type (CNP), widely expressed in brain tissue, particularly in regions related to
thirst, sodium appetite and body fluid homeostasis (Antunes-Rodrigues et al. 2004).
ANP is a small and short-lived peptide secreted by the atrium in response to
changes in volume status and blood pressure (atrial stretch) (Sagnella et al. 1986).The
effects of this hormone include an augmented glomerular filtration, and renal excretion of sodium and water (natriuresis and diuresis) with a secondary reduction in
blood volume and pressure. It inhibits RAAS and the hypothalamic secretion of
AVP (Curry 2005). ***8.2.5 Age-Related Changes of Water Balance in the Elderly***

Aging is associated with significant changes in health and cognitive status and with a
parallelincreaseintheprevalenceofchronickidneydisease(CKD).Inelderlypeople,
the renal blood flow and GFR decline, the weight and size of kidney reduce with
a concomitant creatinine clearance decrease, estimated in cross-sectional studies of
0.8 ml/min/1.73 m [2] per decade after the age of 40 years (Cowen et al. 2013; Muntner
2009). Changes in renal blood flow may be influenced by age-related modifications of
cardiovascular hemodynamics. In addition, structural renal changes occur, including
glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy and arterial hyalinosis. All
these modifications lead to a reduced ability to concentrate or dilute urine (Koch
and Fulop 2017). In healthy elderly individuals compared with healthy young adults,
the maximum urinary concentration decreases from 1.200 to 700–800 mOsm/Kg
H 2 O, at the same time, the maximum urinary diluting varies from 50 to less than
100 mOsm/Kg H 2 O (Rowe et al. 1976; Crowe et al. 1987).
Renal ability to excrete free water depends on the presence of an adequate concentration of solute in the diluting region, on a functional intact distal diluting site
(distal tubule and ascending limb of Henle’s loop), and on suppression of ADH in
order to avoid water reabsorption in the collecting duct (Koch and Fulop 2017).
These mechanisms are frequently altered in aging. On the other hand, age-related
difficulties in renal concentrating capacity are mainly caused by the reduced number of functioning nephrons (with solute diuresis in the remaining intact ones) and
by an abnormally high secretion of ADH in response to appropriate stimuli (Rowe
et al. 1976; Davies et al. 1995). The impairment of the urine concentrating ability


-----

8 Water and Sodium Balance Disorders in Aging 215

also results from the reduction of the osmotic gradient in the medullary region. The
intake of a low-protein diet may contribute to the decreased medullary tonicity; in
fact urea, the greater contributor, derives from the breakdown of proteins (Schlanger
et al. 2010; Dontas et al. 1972; Sands 2012).
In aging the osmoregulatory system appears to be maintained or increased, but
collecting duct sensitivity to ADH is impaired and thirst stimulus is diminished,
increasing the risk of developing water depletion and hypernatremia (Ledingham
et al. 1987; Hypodipsia in geriatric patients 1982). In healthy elderly subjects compared to young ones, elevated basal plasma vasopressin levels have been found;
these may reflect a deregulation in central control systems for AVP release. ADH
secretion is no more strongly correlated with plasma osmolality and sleep-associated
vasopressin peak is reduced or absent with higher urinary flow rate at night compared
to daytime (Koch and Fulop 2017; Asplund and Aberg 1991). Differently, the ADH
response to volume-pressure stimuli is markedly impaired in elderly subjects with an
inadequate increase during orthostatic maneuvers or position changes (Rowe et al.
1982).
Older adults often assume multiple medications for a variety of clinical conditions,
and some of them may alter vasopressin secretion. Moreover illnesses affecting neurohypophysis (tumors, granulomatous disease, vascular damage, and trauma) result
in impaired ADH secretion and reduced thirst perception (Phillips et al. 1991). Mental and physical impairment may limit the ability to communicate the need of water
intake, as well as to assume an adequate amount of fluids (Koch and Fulop 2017).
Older subjects aged 67–75 years present a lower awareness of thirst in condition of
water depletion with a subsequent increased plasma osmolality, but the real grade of
misperception in healthy elderly is unknown (Robertson 1983; Phillips et al. 1984).
The serum activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has found reduced in
older individuals compared to younger men; moreover there are an impaired capacity
to reabsorb sodium and a decreased tubular responsiveness to aldosterone (Conti
et al. 2012; Bauer 1993). Furthermore, Ang II alterations can lead to a reduced thirst
perception (Phillips et al. 1991; Macías Núñez et al. 1978).
In older people, ANP levels are found increased (probably due to an enhanced
atrial sensitivity to afferent system), and its renal effect may be exaggerated (Pollack
et al. 1997). The increase of ANP produces a suppression of renin and consequently
of Ang II and aldosterone. Moreover, ANP suppresses AVP secretion (Ohashi et al.
1987; Heim et al. 1989).
The described age-related changes in the mechanisms that regulate water homeostasis are summarized in the Fig. 8.1.
Dehydration, described as a depletion of total body water (TBW), is a common
problem in older people. It is defined hypotonic (hypo-osmolar), if there is a concomitant salt loss or hypertonic (hyper-osmolar), if there is a free water loss. It is important
to underline that TBW decreases in older people down to 50% (Olde Rikkert et al.
1997). Hypertonicity is associated with high morbidity (in particular neurological
sequelae) and mortality (Rondon-Berrios et al. 2017). It is estimated that about 17%
of older adults hospitalized for dehydration die within 30 days (Waikar et al. 2009).
Marra MV et al. studied 247 older subjects resident in eight community-based long

term care facilities; approximately 38% of them were found dehydrated and 31%
showed impending dehydration (serum osmolarity 295–300 mOsm/kg H 2 O) (Marra
et al. 2016). The general recommendations for daily total water intake vary from
1.0–2.2 L per day in women and 1.2–3.0 L per day in men (Koch and Fulop 2017;
Morley 2015).
Clinical manifestations of dehydration in older adults include: thirst (even if the
stimulus is reduced), dry mouth and tongue, sunken periorbital areas, confusion,
fatigue, dizziness, delirium (common symptom), body weight loss, hypotension and
tachycardia (especially with a concomitant use of anti-hypertensives and diuretics)
(Flaherty and Morley 2013). In elderly people with cognitive impairment or overt
dementia, dehydration can cause hallucinations, depression, anxiety and agitated
behaviour (Wilson and Morley 2003).
An acronym screening tool to assess dehydration risk has been developed by the
Dehydration Council (Fig. 8.2) (Lawhorne L 2008).
###### **8.3 Water Balance in Aging Animal Studies**

As in humans, animal models of aging have shown a reduced thirst and an impaired
ingestive behaviour in response to hyperosmotic stimuli, hypovolemic stimuli and
dehydration (Thunhorst et al. 2009; McKinley et al. 2006).

(Lawhorne L 2008)

In animals, drinking behaviour is stimulated by 1–4% increases in plasma osmolality above basal levels, but aging alters this mechanism (Koch and Fulop 2017).
McKinley et al. have demonstrated a decreased fluid intake in response to polyethylene glycol in the Munich Wistar rat aged 18–24 months, when compared with
younger counterparts (6 and 15 months old). (McKinley et al. 2006). An impaired
fluid intake has been found also in old mice and rats (Brown Norway and Munich
Wistar rats) exposed to a condition of dehydration, produced by fluid deprivation
(with or without diuretic treatment) or by exposure to a heated environment. (Thunhorst et al. 2009; Silver et al. 1991). Furthermore, aged rodents show a reduction
in baroreceptor sensitivity and sodium appetite (Thunhorst and Johnson 2003; Barringer and Buñag 1991).
Numerous studies have described specific functional and structural changes of
aging animals’ kidney. (Begg 2017). In particular, the reduction of GFR, the decrement in number of aquaporin (AQP2 and AQP3) and urea transporter proteins, and the
impaired renal tubular sensitivity to vasopressin may play a role in the development
of water imbalance (Schlanger et al. 2010). On the contrary, AVP levels are found to
be similar to that of younger age groups, suggesting the absence of a pituitary secretory defect. In old rats, renal V2 receptor expression (number of binding sites for
AVP in the basocellular membrane) and second messenger response to AVP-V2R
signalling are down-regulated, they both lead to a decreased renal responsiveness
to the hormone (Catudioc-Vallero et al. 2000). Under conditions of dehydration or
chronic infusion of dDAVP, a V2-selective agonist, the number of AQP2 in the apical
and sub-apical membrane of collecting tubule cells increases, but urine osmolality
doesn’t augment in parallel, as expected (Combet et al. 2003; Tian et al. 2004). Probably the impairment of the AQP2’s phosphorylation interferes with its relocation
to the apical membrane of collecting tubule cells (Combet et al. 2008) The urea

transporters (UT-A1, UT-A2, UT-A3, UT-B) are responsible for the maintenance of
the countercurrent mechanism of kidney in order to produce a concentrated urine;
some of these have been altered with aging (Sands 2012; Sands 2004). Furthermore,
in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, there is a sodium chloride transporter, the NKCC2/BSC1, that actively transports NaCl under the stimulus of AVP
increasing the tonicity in the medulla (Tian et al. 2004; Di Stefano et al. 1991). A
study conducted in F344BN rats, showed that the ones 30 months old had a minor
abundance of NKCC2/BSC1 co-transporters in the outer medulla and less β and γ
subunits of ENaC (Epithelial Sodium Channel) if compared with younger cohorts.
Moreover, following a moderate water restriction, the increase in the expression of
NKCC2/BSC1 co-transporters was less than expected despite a normal AVP secretory response (Tian et al. 2004).
In animal models of aging, the inability of diluting urine is less evident than
the concentrating impairment and it occurs later. AQP2 and UT-A1/UT-A2 downregulation leads to a minor tonicity in the renal papilla explaining the diluting inability; NKCC2/BSC1 co-transporter is involved in both the mechanisms of diluting
and concentrating urine. The reduction in number of sodium chloride transporters
produces a less reabsorption of NaCl, an increase in delivery of the solute load to
the collecting tubule, and finally, a decrease in the solute free water excretion (Tian
et al. 2004; Di Stefano et al. 1991).
Inconclusion,thealterationsfoundinthekidneyofagingrodentsaresimilartothat
described in older humans. The reduced expression of V2R receptor binding, AQP2
and AQP3 may explain an excessive water excretion; while the minor number of urea
and sodium chloride transporters may alter the maintenance of the countercurrent
multiplier system with secondary inability in diluting and concentrating the urine.
All these changes may contribute to the development of water imbalance and sodium
disorders.
###### **8.4 Sodium Balance Disorders Associated with Aging**

Water homeostasis is a balance between the intake and the excretion of water. Water

balance disorders can be divided into hypo-osmolar and hyper-osmolar ones, depending on existing excess or deficiency of body water relative to body solute. Normal
serum sodium concentration ranges from 135 to 145 mmol/l (mEq/l). Sodium is the
main constituent of plasma osmolality, therefore hypo-osmolar and hyper-osmolar
states generally reflect changes in its concentration and correspond respectively with
hyponatremia and hypernatremia (Verbalis 2003; Adler and Verbalis 2006; Anderson
et al. 1985).

###### ***8.4.1 Hyponatremia***

**8.4.1.1** **Definition and clinical aspects of hyponatremia**

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder that clinicians face in clinical
practice (Upadhyay et al. 2009). It is especially found and often neglected in older
adults (Soiza et al. 2014).
Hyponatremia is defined as a serum sodium concentration <135 mmol/l (mEq/l).
The incidence of this disorder in elderly population varies between 0.2 and 29.8%
depending on the criteria used to define both “hyponatremia” and “elderly” (Hawkins
2003). The incidence is reported to be approximately 11% among the elderly outpatients and 22% among those resident in long-term care facilities (Miller et al. 1996;
Miller 1998).
Hyponatraemia is classified depending on biochemical degree (mild, moderate
and profound), time of development (acute or chronic) and clinical features, a wide
variety of manifestations ranging from the absence of symptoms to lethargy, convulsion and coma (Table 8.1) (Spasovski et al. 2014).

While acute onset of hyponatremia is accompanied by severe and well recognized
signs, older patients with chronic disorders present a variety of manifestations: neurocognitive decline, gait disturbances, osteoporosis and falls (and consequent high
risk of bone fractures), need for hospital admission and long-term care (Liamis et al.
2013; Renneboog et al. 2006; Hoorn et al. 2011; Verbalis et al. 2010). Moreover,
all forms of hyponatremia are independently associated with in-hospital mortality
(Wald et al. 2010).
Renneboog B et al., during a “dynamic walking test” consisting of 3 stereotype
steps in tandem, found that participants improved in tasks after correction of serum
sodium level (Renneboog et al. 2006).
Studies in animal models show that mild hyponatremia is a possible cause of gait
abnormalities, falls and cognitive deficits due to subtle neurological changes; the rats
may develope gait and memory deficits in condition of chronic hyponatremia (Negri
and Ayus 2017; Fujisawa et al. 2016).
Severalstudieshavedemonstratedanincreasedriskofbonefractureinolderadults

and aging animals with hyponatremia. Verbalis JC and Colleagues have shown in
a rat model that the chronic imbalance is associated with bone loss and augmented
osteoclastogenesis (Verbalis et al. 2010). About 30% of total body sodium is stored
in the bone, probably the bone matrix resorption is a defensive mechanism of the
body to preserve sodium balance at the expense of bone structure. Follow-up studies
confirmed that this process occurred in aging animals but at a lesser degree than in
the younger cohorts (Verbalis et al. 2010).
Also in humans, chronic hyponatremia seems to be associated with bone demineralization and reduced bone quality, but the studies have reported conflicting
results. In a cross-sectional study, Verbalis JC et al. have demonstrated a significant positive correlation between femoral BMD and plasma sodium concentration in
hyponatremic patients, whereas no association was found in the normonatremic ones
(Verbalis et al. 2010). Also Kinsella S and Colleagues described a decrease in BMD
in a group of hyponatremic subjects compared to normonatremic counterparts, but
their findings suggest that the increased risk for bone fractures caused by hyponatremia occurs independently of BMD (Kinsella et al. 2010) On the contrary, Hoorn
EJ et al. found no relationship between hyponatremia and BMD, even if hyponatremic patients showed an high risk for fractures due to the increased number of falls
(Hoorn et al. 2011).
Finally, subsequent animal studies have implicated hyponatremia in the development of other pathological conditions, regarding the heart, the skeletal muscle
and the gonads. The reason is that hyponatremia may exacerbate the well-known
aspects of senescence, as osteoporosis, cardiomyopathy, sarcopenia, hypogonadism
and changes in body composition (Cowen et al. 2013).
Depending on plasma osmolality, hyponatremia can be divided in two main categories: non-hypotonic and hypotonic (Fig. 8.3).
**Non-hypotonic hyponatremia** may be classified into isotonic and hypertonic
hyponatremia. **Isotonic hyponatremia** is also known as “pseudo-hyponatremia”.
Under this condition, plasma sodium level seems to be reduced due to an exaggerate
dilution by non-aqueous material (such as, in diseases characterized by augmented

**Fig. 8.3** Clinical approach to hyponatremia (Spasovski et al. 2014)

intravascular proteins or lipids), but the effective concentration in the aqueous portion
of a plasma sample is normal (Kim 2006) In **hypertonic hyponatremia** an excess of
“effective osmoles” in the ECF augments its tonicity and attracts water from the intracellular compartment causing a “translocational-hyponatraemia”, or hyponatremia
by dilution due to hyperosmolality. If water returns to the intracellular space, serum
sodium concentration increases until normal values.These osmoles may be: glucose
in uncontrolled hyperglycemia, mannitol, glycine, hyperosmolar contrast medium
(Hillier et al. 1999; Aviram et al. 1967; Desmond 1970).
The **hypotonic hyponatremia** is further differentiated in hypovolemic, hypervolemic and, the most common form, euvolemic. ECF status may be assessed by
physical exam (vital signs, response to orthostatic maneuvers, jugular venous pressure, skin and mucous turgor, peripheral edema, plasmatic levels of urea and uric
acid) and by measuring urinary sodium excretion (Spasovski et al. 2014).
Hyponatremia may occur in case of extracellular volume depletion, **hypovolemic**
**hyponatremia**, due to renal or extrarenal losses, with or without deficit of total
body sodium. The ADH secretion is abnormally stimulated and it may lead to water
retention despite hypotonicity (Spasovski et al. 2014). ECF depletion is common in
elderly patients treated with diuretics, in particular thiazides, which interfere with
urinary diluting ability (not with concentrating ability), thus leading to an excess of
free water excretion (Friedman et al. 1989).


-----

222 M. Boemi and M. P. Luconi

Hyponatremia may also be recognized in condition of ECF expansion, **hyper-**
**volemic hyponatremia** . In renal failure, the ability of kidney to dilute urine and
excrete free water is decreased. In severe CKD, the urine osmolality is similar to
serum osmolality, condition known as isosthenuria; fluid restriction is able to limit
the development of hyponatremia. In nephrotic syndrome, the water retention due to
activity of ADH is generally balanced by intense sodium retention; it is the administration of diuretics that, in combination with high level of ADH, may lead to moderate
hyponatraemia (Spasovski et al. 2014).
Approximately 20–30% of patients with chronic heart failure NYHA classes III
and IV have hyponatremia, which augment the severity of the disease and the risk
of death. The renal sodium retention causes the increase of ECF but effective circu
lating blood volume is generally reduced due to impaired cardiac output. In elderly
individuals, the congestive heart failure is associated with further reduction of renal
perfusion and GFR, leading to the development of hyponatremia if the activation
of RAAS (secondary hyperaldosteronism) has been overcome. The activation of
RAAS and the secretion of vasopressin (baroreceptor-mediated) limit urinary sodium
excretion; although the treatment with diuretics (especially thiazides) may produce
hyponatremia (Albert NM 2007; Goland et al. 2011).
In liver failure, as well as in heart failure, there are sodium retention and reduction of effective circulating blood volume. Baroreceptors stimulate the vasopressin
release, moreover the simultaneous use of mineralocorticoid receptor blockers (alone
or in combination with loop diuretics), may contribute to the development of hyponatremia(Kim et al. 2008).
Elderly individuals with immobility syndrome (IS) are unable to perform daily
tasks because of motor deterioration; they usually experience muscle rigidity, orthostatic hypotension, low cardiac output, increase in total body water and finally lower
serum sodium. Musso C et al. found in the elderly with IS, compared to healthy
mobile elderly, a higher total body water. They also described in this group no correlation between plasma osmolality and vasopressin level, in contrast with the mobile
group, for which there was a positive correlation between plasma osmolality and
plasma vasopressin (Musso et al. 2009).
**Euvolemic hyponatremia** is caused by normal or slightly increased extracellular
volume in the absence of edema. It results from an excessive fluid intake in presence
of an impaired free water excretion, due to inappropriate release of vasopressin or
low sodium intake. The “syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis” (SIAD) or “inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion” (SIADH) accounts for approximately half
of cases. It is the most common cause of hyponatremia in elderly populations (Cowen
et al. 2013; Anpalahan 2001; Hirshberg and Ben-Yehuda 1997). This syndrome was
first described by Bartter FC and Schwartz WB in 1957; the diagnostic criteria were
summarized 10 years later (Table 8.2) (Schwartz et al. 1957; Bartter and Schwartz
1967; Janicic and Verbalis 2003) In SIADH, the vasopressin secretion is inappropriate and independent from effective plasma osmolality or circulating blood volume
(increased pituitary secretion or ectopic production). Excessive antidiuresis may also
resultfromhyper-activityofADHinthecollectingduct(inexample,gain-of-function
mutation in its receptor). In elderly people, a large variety of diseases and medications

…); it has also been described an idiopathic form that accounts for about one-quarter
to one-half of cases (Cowen et al. 2013; Anpalahan 2001; Hirshberg and Ben-Yehuda
1997). Possible causes of SIADH are summarized in Table 8.3.
Hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency are other causes of euvolemic hyponatremia (Spasovski et al. 2014). Secondary adrenal insufficiency is associated with
reduced or absent secretion of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and thus with
hypocortisolism.Lowplasmacortisollevelsfailtoinhibitthecentralsecretionofboth
ACTHandADHleadingtoimpairedfreewaterexcretionandhyponatremia(FaustiniFustini and Anagni 2006) Severe hypothyroidism is a rare cause of hyponatremia;
serum sodium concentration approximately decreases by 0.14 mmol/l for every
10 mcUI/ml rise in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The reduction in cardiac
output and GFR may result in both sodium disorder and myxoedema (Warner et al.
2006; Kilpatrick 2006).

**8.4.1.2** **Treatment of hyponatremia**

Recommendations for treatment of hyponatremia differ on the basis of expert panel
consensus considered. In the elderly, the underlying cause should be researched and
corrected with particular attention to multiple medications and volemic status. The
optimal drug prescribing is one of the cornerstones of a comprehensive geriatric
assessment; therapy should be reviewed with the aim to stop unnecessary drugs and

adjust the doses on the basis of efficacy and organ damage (in particular, CKD or
liver failure) (Soiza et al. 2014). The over-prescription of thiazide diuretics, serotonin reuptake inhibitors or proton pump inhibitors is usually observed; it may cause
fragility fractures and hyponatremia to a much greater extent in the elderly than in
other age groups (Schlanger et al. 2010; Soiza et al. 2014; Cumming et al. 2014).
In inpatient settings the infusion of **isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl)** is indicated in
all forms of hypovolemic hyponatremia. It produces expansion of extracellular fluid
and suppresses the non-osmotic vasopressin secretion (Verbalis et al. 2013).
Intravenous **hypertonic saline (3% NaCl)** is reserved for any forms of severe
hyponatremia, acute or chronic, because this solution overrides the ability of kidney
to concentrate urinary sodium. It is recommended an infusion bolus of 100–150 ml


-----

8 Water and Sodium Balance Disorders in Aging 225

over the first 10–20 min, then the check of serum sodium level and eventually the
repetition of another infusion bolus in the next 20 min. If 3% NaCl is given as
continuous infusion, the increase of serum sodium of 1 mmol/l/hour is desirable. The
infusion may be stopped when the symptoms improve or when the serum sodium
concentration increases 6–10 mmol/l in 24 h (maximum 18 mmol/l in 48 h) or
reaches 130 mmol/l. A too rapid correction exposes the patient to the risk for osmotic
demyelination, thus it is recommended a control of serum sodium every two hours
to adjust the rate of infusion. Severe chronic forms of hyponatremia, hepatic failure,
alcoholism,potassiumdepletionandmalnutritionincreasetheriskforcerebraledema
associated with an aggressive correction (Verbalis et al. 2013; Mohmand et al. 2007;
Whitmire 2008).
Whenever feasible, medical nutrition therapy should be modified to support efforts
of restoring water and sodium homeostasis. For patients who are receiving enteral
nutrition, fluid intake can be increased by switching to a less calorically dense enteral
formula and by augmenting tube flushes, whereas sodium intake can be increased by
administering a formula with higher sodium content (Whitmire 2008). The following
equation can be used to estimate the amount of sodium required:

Sodium requirement

� TBW (1) × [desidered plasma Sodium (mmol/l) − current plasma Sodium (mmol/l)]

*T BW* � *T otal Body Water*

**Diuretics (loop diuretics)** may be given orally or intravenously to treat hypervolemic hyponatremia or SIADH. These induce a copious water diuresis but also
urinary sodium excretion, for this reason sometimes they may worsen hyponatremia
(Soiza et al. 2014; Decaux et al. 1981).
**Fluidrestriction** toabout 0.8–1.0Lin24his thefirst linetreatment of theSIADH,
but this is often ineffective and ill-tolerated, especially in young adults. Moreover, the
SIADH is characterized by a reset of the “thirst osmostat”, meaning that the plasma
osmolalitycut-off abletotrigger thirst is lower withsecondaryaugmentedfluidintake
(Smith et al. 2004) For patients receiving central parenteral nutrition, the formula
administered should be concentrated to restrict the amount of water and the effective

osmolality of the solution should be adjusted to exceed urine osmolality. It should be
considered that there are maximum osmolality constraints inherent with peripheral
parenteral, thus the possibility to control the effective osmolality of regimens is
limited. For patients on enteral nutrition, the intake of electrolyte-free fluids should
be replaced by a formula with higher electrolyte concentration (Whitmire 2008).
Predictors of failure of fluid restriction include the high urine osmolality and the
increase in serum sodium less than 2 mmol/l/day (Koch and Fulop 2017).
A direct specific treatment of SIADH, and potentially of hypervolemic hyponatremia or other forms of euvolemic hyponatremia, is the administration of oral vasopressin renal V2-receptor antagonists, **vaptans** . Tolvaptan, an orally available antagonist, has been demonstrated to possess high efficiency in the correction of hyponatremia with minor side effects but high cost. Tolvaptan is available as a tablet, usually
taken once a day in the morning. The recommended dosage for SIADH is 15–30 mg

per day. It targets the pathological mechanism underlying the hyponatremia in this
condition, an excessive ADH secretion; for this reason serum sodium levels falls
again when treatment is discontinued. Patients receiving tolvaptan should discontinue any previous fluid restriction and drink fluids ad libitum (Soiza et al. 2014;
Gross 2012). A major concern in the treatment of older people is the safety profile of
vaptans, considering that their aquaretic action increases the risk for volemic depletion. In the SALT trials (Study of Ascending Levels of Tolvaptan in Hyponatremia)
the adverse effects seen with tolvaptan were similar to that with placebo; moreover
the EVEREST study demonstrated a good safety profile after a median 9.9 months
of treatment with tolvaptan, but only 10% of subjects enrolled had hyponatremia at
baseline (Spasovski et al. 2014; Schrier et al. 2006; Konstam et al. 2007). Tolerability
and safety of tolvaptan were also assessed in subsequent trials, however caution and
further evaluations are needed in the elderly (Soiza et al. 2014).
###### ***8.4.2 Hypernatremia***

Definition and clinical aspects of hypernatremia
Hypernatremia is a common electrolyte disorder resulting from a deficit of body
water relative to body solutes. Hypernatremia is defined as a serum sodium concentration>145 mmol/l (mEq/l); it is an hyperosmolar disorder because sodium is the main
constituent of plasma osmolality. It should be remembered that, if hypernatremia is
always synonymous of hyperosmolality, hyperosmolality can exist without hypernatremia, in case of excess of non-sodium solute relative to TBW. The latter condition
may occur with marked elevation of plasma glucose in non-ketotic hyperglycaemic
hyperosmolar syndrome (Verbalis 2003).
As well as hyponatremia, hypernatremia is associated with increased morbidity
and mortality especially in the elderly and critically ill patients. Approximately 1%
of patients over 60 years old admitted in hospital for acute illness are found to be
hypernatremic (Liamis et al. 2013). Mortality rates are greater than 40% and related
to the underlying cause of hypernatremia (Liamis et al. 2013; Palevsky et al. 1996).
Liber M et al. observed that elderly with hypernatremia admitted in hospital had lower
baseline functional and cognitive status and higher APACHE II scores if compared
with the normonatremic counterparts (Liber et al. 2016).
Hypernatremia may result from increased water loss (the majority of cases),
decreased water intake or sodium gain.
Thirstisadefencemechanismagainsthypernatremia,thereforeoldersubjectswith
a decrease in thirst stimulus, with cognitive impairment or difficulties to obtain adequate fluids have an high risk for hypernatremia (Wong and Verbalis 2002; Palevsky
1998). Hyperosmotic state is further exacerbated by the inability to concentrate urine
that occurs with aging and some medications (Danowski et al. 1946).
They have been described in a previous paragraph the impairment of thirst
behaviour, the reduction of baroreceptor sensitivity and sodium appetite, and the

alterations of kidney function that occur in animals with aging and lead to the development of hypernatremia.
On the basis of volemic status this disorder can be divided in three categories:
hypovolemic hypernatremia (water deficit in excess of sodium deficit), hypervolemic
hypernatremia (sodium gain in excess of water gain), and euvolemic hypernatremia
(pure water loss) (Table 8.4) (Adrogué and Madias 2000).
The assessment of volemic status and urinary sodium helps in defining the etiology
of hypernatremia. The urine osmolality evaluation is an useful but not validated tool.
The following formula may be used to calculate free water fluid deficit:

Free Water Fluid Deficit

� [Serum Na] [+] [ (mmol/L)] × usual BW (kg) × 0 *.* 5 − [BW (kg) × 0 *.* 5]

160 mmol/l (Arieff and Guisado 1976) Clinical manifestations of hypernatremia are
summarized in Table 8.5 (Kim 2006).

**8.4.2.1** **Treatment of hypernatremia**

In condition of hypertonicity, brain cells initially uptake electrolytes and loss water.
With a prolonged hyperosmolar status, the electrolytes in excess are replaced by
organic solutes, historically termed “idiogenic osmoles” because considered to be
produced by the brain cells themselves.
Subsequent studies in animals and cultured cells have found that the “idiogenic
osmoles” are the same organic osmolytes used by all organisms for volume regulation; in the mammalian brain they include myo-inositol, taurine, glycerylphosphorylcholine and betaine, uptaked from extracellular fluids through the activation of
sodium-dependent cotransporters. The accumulation of these osmolytes leads to the
shift of water from the cerebrospinal fluid into the brain, with gradual restoring neuron volume. The cerebral adaptation in hypernatremia explain why many subjects
are asymptomatic (Kim 2006).
Before correction of hypernatremia, it is important to define if the rise in serum
sodium is acute (<48 h) or chronic (>48 h). The rapid correction of a chronic state of
hypertonicity can result in increased intracranial pressure and brain stem herniation.
The myelinolysis (cerebral edema) is the most fearsome complication of hyperosmolar settings (hypernatremia or hyper-hypoglicemia), as well as of rapid correction
of severe hyponatremia (Lien et al. 1990; Adrogué and Madias 2000).
The treatment of hypernatremia differs on the basis of the underlying pathogenesis. The gastrointestinal tract is able to absorb a large amount of water and solutes,
but in presence of critical illnesses or gastrointestinal diseases, this ability may be
compromised with the subsequent risk of abdominal distension, vomiting and pulmonary aspiration. Moreover, in patients who are receiving enteral nutrition, the


-----

8 Water and Sodium Balance Disorders in Aging 229

additional load of fluids should be considered. For this reasons, the proper route of
water replacement, oral or intravenous, must be identified. In hypovolemic disorders
with loss of total body sodium along with free water, isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl)
infusion is recommended. In euvolemic hypernatremia, with free water depletion
and normal total body sodium, therapy consists of intake of water. In edematous and
hypernatremic patients (excess of total body sodium and free water) therapy consists
of sodium and fluid restriction. Diuretics may be considered in association with free
water intake (Adrogué and Madias 2000).
In patients with prolonged plasma hyperosmolality, the aim of treatment is the
decrease in serum sodium of 8–10 mmol/l in the first 24 h or achieving a serum
sodium level of 145 mmol/l (Adrogué and Madias 2000).
Rehydration in the elderly is a challenge for the risk of fluid overload (particularly
in patients with CKD or heart failure) and for improper inhibition of vasopressin
secretion with subsequent lower thirst perception (Koch and Fulop 2017).
###### **8.5 Conclusion**

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are the most common electrolyte disorders seen
in the elderly; they substantially reflect changes in plasma osmolality.
The numerous causes recognized include: cognitive impairment, alteration of
thirst, changes in fluid intake behaviour, kidney’s inability to concentrate or dilute
the urine, assumption of multiple medications and acute illnesses. Some of these
alterations have been recognized also in animal models of study.
The sodium disorders may result in a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations,
rangingfromthesubtlealterations of chronicforms tothesevereneurological signs of
acute conditions. They also represent a major cause of hospitalization in the elderly.
Despite the economic burden and the severity of clinical implications, not rarely
these electrolyte disorders are under-estimated or neglected. The challenge of clinicians should be primarily that of preventing sodium and water imbalance in the
elderly. If the disorder has already been established, the efforts should focus on the
research and treatment of the underlying cause, with particular attention to multiple
medications. **References**

##### **Chapter 9**
#### **Magnesium Role in Health and Longevity**

**Mario Barbagallo and Ligia J. Dominguez**

**Abstract** Reduced Magnesium (Mg) intake is a frequent cause of Mg deficit with
age. A decreased intestinal Mg absorption and an increased Mg loss may also contribute, as well as the use of medicaments. Furthermore, Mg requirements may be
higher with aging. Alterations of Mg metabolism with age, cellular Mg transport systems and problems with measurement methods are discussed. Mg contained in water
is more bio-available than Mg in food and it is a possible alternative to Mg supplementation in the correction of Mg deficiencies. Mild to moderate Mg deficits are generally
asymptomatic and clinical signs are usually absent or non-specific. Hyperemotionality, tremor, asthenia, sleep disorders, and amnesic and cognitive disturbances are
frequent in older adults, and may be often overlooked or confused with age-related
symptoms. Chronic Mg deficiency results in oxidative stress and chronic, low-grade
inflammation, which may be linked to several age-related diseases, and to the aging
process itself. Mg deficit-related conditions may involve different tissues and organs,
including hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and metabolic
syndrome, asthma and airways constrictive syndromes, depression and psychiatric
disorders, Alzheimer’s disease and neuromuscular diseases (chronic fatigue, muscle
pain, fibromyalgia), fragility fractures, and cancer. Keeping an optimal Mg balance
throughout life might help to prevent some chronic disease associated to aging, and
to extend healthy life. This needs to be proven by future studies.

###### **9.1 Introduction**

Magnesium ion (Mg) is the second most abundant cation after potassium (K) in the
intracellular compartment and the fourth most common mineral in the human body
after calcium (Ca), sodium (Na) and K; Mg atomic weight is 24.305 g/mol, and its
atomic number is 12 (Table 9.1). Mg is a member of Group IIA in the periodic table
and thus an alkaline-earth element; it forms most stable complexes with phosphate
and carboxylate anions or with nitrogen base. Mg is an essential cofactor for numerous biological processes, and it is required for energy production, oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, protein synthesis, and nucleic acid synthesis and stability (Saris
et al. 2000). Mg plays a role in the active transport of other ions across cell membranes, such as Ca and K, modulating neuron excitability, muscle contraction, and
normal heart rhythm. Mg has a key role in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis
in mitochondria, to create a complex with Mg (MgATP) (Barbagallo and Dominguez
2007). Cell signaling requires MgATP for protein phosphorylation and for the synthesis and activation of cell-signaling molecule cyclic adenosine monophosphate
(cAMP) involved in a myriad of biochemical processes (Reinhart 1988).
Mg has critical role in modulating a wide variety of critical cellular activities and
metabolic pathways. Mg is cofactor in over three hundred enzymatic reactions, and in
particular is required for the activity of all rate-limiting glycolytic enzymes, protein
kinases, and in all phosphorylation processes and in all reactions that involve ATP
utilization and transfer (Barbagallo and Dominguez 2007). Mg has a weak calcium
antagonist action and has many structural functions (multi-enzyme complexes, i.e.,
G-proteins, *N* -methyl-d-aspartic acid [NMDA] receptors, mitochondria, polyribosomes, proteins and nucleic acids synthesis, etc.).
Therefore, Mg is a critical factor for normal cellular and body homeostasis
(Table 9.2). Over the past decades, the clinical relevance and biological significance of Mg have been documented, as well as the impact of Mg on molecular and
physiological processes of aging, and on health and age-related clinical diseases.

###### **9.2 Magnesium Metabolism and Requirement**

In the human body, approximately 24 g (1 mol) of Mg are present, of which about
65% are stored in bone and 34% in the intracellular space. Less than 1% of total
Mg is contained in blood serum; normal serum Mg concentrations range between
0.75 and 0.95 mmol/L (1.7–2.5 mg/dL or 1.5–1.9 meq/L). The levels of Mg in
the plasma of healthy people are extremely constant and are tightly controlled and
maintained within this narrow range by the small intestine and the kidney; both
increase their fractional Mg absorption under conditions of Mg deprivation. If Mg
depletion continues, the bone store helps to maintain serum Mg concentration by
exchanging part of its content with extracellular fluid (Fig. 9.1) (Barbagallo et al.
2003).
In the serum, Mg exists in three forms: a protein-bound fraction (25% bound to
albumin and 8% bound to globulins), a chelated fraction (12%), and the metabolically
active ionized fraction (Mg-ion: 55%). Hypomagnesemia is defined as a serum Mg
level less than 0.75 mmol/L (Barbagallo et al. 2003). Intracellular Mg concentrations
arehighlyregulatedandMgitselfactsasanintracellularregulatorofcellcyclecontrol
and apoptosis. Intracellular Mg exists mainly in a bound form. Plasma Mg levels do
not always reflect intracellular or total Mg.
Mg balance is controlled by Mg intake, by its absorption through intestine, by
the renal excretion, and by the Mg requirement of different tissues (e.g., skeletal
and cardiac muscle uptake and usage) (Quamme 2008). Daily Mg requirement is
calculated to be around 300–400 mg in healthy adults (5–6 mg/kg/day) but may be

**Table 9.3** Determinants of ma g nesium e q uilibrium

 - Gastrointestinal absorption and renal excretion are the main determinants of Mg equilibrium

 - Healthy individuals need to consume 0.2–0.4 mmol/kg of body weight/day to stay in balance

 - Extracellular Mg is in equilibrium with that in the bone, kidneys, intestine, and other soft
tissues

 - Bone is the main reservoir of Mg

 - Primary renal disorders cause hypomagnesemia by decreased tubular reabsorption of Mg

 - Osmotic diuresis results in magnesium loss

 - Drugs may cause magnesium wasting

higher in several physiological conditions (i.e. pregnancy, aging, exercise, etc.) and
diseases (type 2 diabetes, infections, etc.). The main site for Mg absorption is the
small intestine. Healthy persons need to consume 0.2–0.4 mmol/kg/day to maintain
the balance (Table 9.3). Since the Mg stored in the bone cannot quickly exchange
with the Mg in extracellular fluids, the quick Mg needs are provided by the Mg stored
in the intracellular compartment. Kidney also has a key role in Mg homeostasis and
about 120 mg of Mg are excreted into the urine each day (Saris et al. 2000). Renal Mg
handling is tightly dependent on Mg body status, since Mg deficiency increases renal
Mg reabsorption across all nephron segments. In fact, urinary excretion is reduced
when Mg is depleted (Shils 1969). Diuretic drugs may also modify renal Mg handling
by reducing Mg reabsorption (Quamme 1997).

9 Magnesium Role in Health and Longevity 239

Although no known hormonal factor is specifically involved in the regulation of
Mg metabolism, many hormones are recognized to have an effect on Mg balance
and transport. Among them, parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcitonin, catecholamines,
and insulin have a major role (Barbagallo et al. 2003, 2007).
###### **9.3 Magnesium Measurements Methods**

Measurements of total serum Mg concentrations (MgT) are not an accurate measure
of the body Mg status; MgT measurements are useful in epidemiological studies,
but do not detect subclinical Mg deficit in an individual basis (Elin 2010). Others,
more precise and expensive techniques, such as [31] P-NMR spectroscopy, still remain
mainly a research tool. The development of Mg-specific ion-selective electrodes,
that measure the active ionized fraction of Mg, has been more appropriate, allowing
measuring extracellular free levels of Mg with a higher sensitivity than MgT in order
to detect subclinical Mg deficits in several medical conditions (Barbagallo et al. 2014;
Resnick et al. 1997). **9.4 Cellular Magnesium Transport System**

Transient receptor potential (TRP) is a family of protein containing both, a cationpermeable ion channel and a kinase domain (Clapham et al. 2001). TRPM7 is a
divalent cation-selective ion channel that is permeable to Ca [2+] and Mg [2+] . The channel
is downregulated by intracellular levels of Mg [2+], MgATP, and other Mg-nucleotides
(Penner and Fleig 2007). The channel plays a key role in Mg homeostasis due to
its preference for divalent ions (Romani 2011). TRPM7 represents a ubiquitous
homeostatic mechanism that regulates Ca [2+] and Mg [2+] fluxes. Reducing the cellular
levels of Mg stimulates the activation of TRPM7-mediated currents (Faouzi et al.
2017). **9.5 Magnesium Deficiency with Aging: Causes** **and Mechanisms**

Mg deficits are common in old age (Barbagallo and Dominguez 2010). Total plasma
Mg concentrations do not change with age (Yang et al. 1990). Differences in Mg
levels are generally related to the presence of age-related diseases and alterations in
renal function. Studies using 24-h Mg retention showed an increased Mg retention in
old age, suggesting a significant subclinical Mg deficit, not detected by total serum
Mg (Gullestad et al. 1994). In healthy persons, we showed that intracellular free

**Table 9.4** Main mechanisms of ma g nesium deficit with a g in g

*Primary Mg deficit*

 - Inadequate Mg dietary intake

 - Reduced efficiency of Mg absorption (associated with reduced vitamin D levels)?

 - Increased urinary excretion of Mg (Mg) (associated with age-dependent reduction of kidney
function and of Mg tubular reabsorption)

*Secondary Mg deficiency*

 - Associated with age-related diseases and comorbidities

 - Increased urinary Mg loss secondary to drugs (i.e. diuretics) frequently used in the older

persons

Mg decreases with age; we have specifically studied the behavior of intracellular
Mg content with age, using the gold standard method (31P-NMR spectroscopy) in
healthy young and older persons and have shown a continuous age-dependent fall of
intracellular Mg levels in red blood cells of healthy older adults (Barbagallo et al.
2000), while total serum Mg was not significantly altered with age. It has been
shown that many older adults are prone to chronic latent Mg deficiency (Table 9.4),
and epidemiological data from US and Europe have confirmed that low Mg intake
is a common condition in older persons (Ford and Mokdad 2003; Galan et al. 1997).
However, it has been suggested that Mg requirement do not change with age (Hunt
and Johnson 2006). Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) III showed that Mg intake tend to decrease with age (Ford and Mokdad
2003). In addition, older adults affected by chronic conditions and on chronic drug
treatment have an additional risk of being Mg deficient. The recommended Mg intake
in the US population is 420 and 320 mg/day for men and women, respectively, but
Mg intake in the US older population is far below (225 and 166 mg/day for men and
women, respectively) (Table 9.5) (Ford and Mokdad 2003). Sixty eight per cent of
US adults consume less than the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of Mg, Fortyfive per cent consume less than 75% of the RDA, and nineteen per cent consume
less than 50% of the RDA (King et al. 2005). The “Suppléments en Vitamines et
Minéraux AntioXydants” (SU.VI.MAX) study showed that seventy-seven per cent
of women and seventy-two per cent of men have dietary Mg intakes lower than RDA;
twenty three per cent of women and eighteen per cent of men consumed less than
2/3 of these RDA (Galan et al. 1997).
Decreased intestinal Mg absorption may further contribute to Mg deficiency in the
elderly (Coudray et al. 2006). Mg absorption tends to decrease with age. Duodenum
and ileum are mainly involved in Mg absorption and both passive and active transport
processes are involved. The alterations of the intestinal absorption of Mg in old
age may be also aggravated by the frequent age-related impairment of vitamin D
homeostasis. Kidney active reabsorption of Mg takes place in the loop of Henle
and in the proximal convoluted tubule. A latent primary renal disorder may also be
associated to an increased Mg loss linked to a reduced tubular reabsorption.

logical conditions (i.e., type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, alcoholism,
hyperadrenoglucocorticism, HIV/AIDS, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, etc.).
Mg depletion due to an excess urinary loss may be related to treatment with loop
diuretics. Patients receiving long-term treatment with thiazide diuretics are also at
risk, especially in old age. Hypokalemia is often associated with diuretic-induced
Mg depletion. It has been reported the finding of hypomagnesemia in 38–42% of
hypokalemic patients. The correction of a K deficit may be difficult to achieve unless
the Mg deficit is also corrected, hence patients with hypokalemia should be evaluated
for Mg deficiency. Other commonly used medications may diminish Mg absorption
and/or reduce Mg levels (e.g., H 2 blockers, proton pump inhibitors, antacids, antibiotics, antihistamines, antivirals, and antiepileptic drugs, among others).
Western diets, generally very low in whole grains and green vegetables, and high
in refined foods, are often severely deficient in Mg (Table 9.6). Food processing
may significantly lower Mg content. Because most of the Mg present in food is
lost in cooking or refining procedures, diets that provide a high proportion of daily
calorie requirements from refined or processed foods are likely to be low in Mg
(Durlach et al. 1985). Cooking, especially boiling of foods may cause a significant
loss of Mg. Processed food accounts for a substantial portion of the diet in western
countries, which makes more probable the establishment of a state of true or relative
Mg deficiency (Barbagallo and Dominguez 2010). Furthermore, phytic acid found
in certain foods lowers the absorption of Mg. Some pesticide agents, commonly used
in the crops, such as glyphosate, may chelate minerals including Mg (Cakmak et al.
2009), further decreasing the content of Mg in soil and in some crops. Organic food,

from pesticide-free soils, was found to have significantly more Mg than non-organic
control food (Griffiths et al. 2012).
Because of this substandard dietary content of Mg in developed countries, Mg
intake is often significantly reduced. In this context, Mg intake derived from drinking
water rich in Mg may represent a possible alternative to supplements in Mg deficits
(Galan et al. 2002).
In the SU.VI.MAX cohort, drinking water contributed 6–17% of total daily Mg
intake depending on the Mg concentration of the mineral water used. Drinkers of
mineral water rich in Mg and water with a moderate mineral content had Mg intakes
significantly higher than those of drinkers on low mineralized or tap water. Therefore,
mineral-rich water may provide an important supplementary contribution to total Mg
intake (Galan et al. 2002). In addition, bio-availability of Mg in water is higher when
compared to Mg in food and it is easy to add Mg to water, but virtually impossible
to add Mg to foods. Mg content may be important not only in drinking water, but
also in water used for cooking, since the concentration of Mg in water may interfere
with the leakage of Mg in food during cooking, and may reduce the loss of Mg in
the cooked/boiled food.

###### **9.6 Magnesium, Inflammation and Oxidative Stress**

Hypomagnesaemia has been shown to cause increased production of oxygen free
radicals. Poor Mg diets are associated with a low-grade chronic inflammatory state,
both, by initiating an excessive production and release of interleukin (IL)-1β and
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alfa, and by stimulating the synthesis of nitric oxide and
some inflammatory markers (Kramer et al. 2003; Mazur et al. 2007). Mg deficiency
also increases the aggregation and adhesiveness of platelets, and inhibits growth and
migration of endothelial cell, potentially modulating microvascular functions (Mazur
et al. 2007).
In animals, several studies have shown that Mg deprivation causes: (i) marked elevation of proinflammatory molecules TNF-alfa, IL-1-beta, IL-6, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 (MalpuechBrugère et al. 2000; Mazur et al. 2007); (ii) increased circulating inflammatory cells
(Galland 1988), and (iii) increased hepatic production and release of acute phase
proteins (i.e., complement, alfa2-macroblobulin, fibrinogen) (Bussière et al. 2003;
Mazur et al. 2007).
Inhumans,clinicaldatahaveshownthatlowserumMglevelsaswellasinadequate
dietary Mg are strongly related to low-grade systemic inflammation (King et al. 2005;
Guerrero-Romero et al. 2011; Song et al. 2007). Several other studies have confirmed
an inverse relationship among Mg intake, serum Mg and inflammation markers. Data
from the Women’s Health Study have shown that Mg intake is inversely related to
systemic inflammation, measured by serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations,
and with the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in adult women (Song et al.
2005). Using the 1999–2002 NHANES databases, King et al. found that dietary Mg
intake was inversely related to CRP levels. Among 70% of the population not taking
supplements, Mg intake below the RDA was significantly associated with a higher
risk of having elevated CRP (King et al. 2005).
Mg deficiency has been associated with increased oxidative stress and decreased
antioxidant defense competence. Previous studies have shown compellingly that
Mg deficiency results in an increased production of oxygen-derived free radicals
in various tissues, increased free radical-elicited oxidative tissue damage, increased
production of superoxide anion by inflammatory cells, decreased antioxidant enzyme
expressionandactivity, decreasedcellular andtissueantioxidant levels, andincreased
oxygen peroxide production (Weglicki et al. 1996; Mazur et al. 2007)
In rats, Mg deficiency has been shown to increase lipid peroxidation and malondialdehyde and to decrease hepatic glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and vitamin
E (Calviello et al. 1994). We have suggested a link between the action of Mg in
altering the antioxidant capacity and in activating oxidative stress, inflammation,
and lipid oxidation with insulin resistance, diabetes, and cardio-metabolic syndrome
(Barbagallo and Dominguez 2007).
Aging is characterized by a chronic, low-grade inflammatory state that involves
several tissues and organs, and that has been named “inflammaging” (Franceschi
et al. 2017).


-----

244 M. Barbagallo and L. J. Dominguez

**Fig. 9.2** Chronic magnesium deficit has been proposed as one of the physiopathological links that
may help explain the interactions among inflammation, oxidative stress, and aging

We have suggested that the Mg deficiency through its role in facilitating an impairment of the redox status and a low-grade inflammation may be a link to several
age-related diseases and/or to accelerated aging (Fig. 9.2) (Barbagallo et al. 2009;
Barbagallo and Dominguez 2010). Mg itself possesses antioxidant properties scavenging oxygen radicals possibly by affecting the rate of spontaneous dismutation of
the superoxide ion (Weglicki et al. 1992).
###### **9.7 Mg and the Immune Responses**

There is evidence that Mg may play a role in the immune response as a cofactor for immunoglobulin (Ig) synthesis, C3 convertase, immune cell adherence,
antibody-dependent cytolysis, IgM lymphocyte binding, macrophage response to
lymphokines, and T helper-β cell adherence (Tam et al. 2003; Galland 1988). In
addition, Mg deficiency seems to accelerate thymus involution. One of the most
remarkable results regarding effects of Mg deficiency on the organism is the higher
level of apoptosis shown in thymuses from Mg-deficient rats as compared with controls (Malpuech-Brugère et al. 1999). Mg-deficient diet has been shown to alter
polymorphonuclear cell number and function, together with an increased number of


-----

9 Magnesium Role in Health and Longevity 245

neutrophils, related to an increased activity of phagocytosis (Bussière et al. 2003).
Mg is also involved in human cell apoptosis. Fas-induced β-cell apoptosis is Mgdependent. Elevation of intracellular free Mg levels is needed for Fas molecule binding expression on the β-cell surface to trigger signaling pathways that cause apoptosis
and cellular death (Chien et al. 1999).
###### **9.8 Magnesium Deficits and Aging Related Diseases** ***9.8.1 Clinical Signs and Symptoms***

Severe Mg deficit may be associated with neuromuscular symptoms, such as weakness, tremor, muscle fasciculation, dysphagia, positive Chvostek’s sign (facial twitching as a reaction to the tapping of the facial nerve), and positive Trousseau’s sign
(spasm of muscles of the hand and forearm following the application of a pressure cuff, transiently occluding the brachial artery). Neurologic disturbances may
involve both, the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, causing orthostatic hypotension or borderline hypertension.
Mild to moderate Mg deficits are generally asymptomatic and clinical signs are
usually absent and/or non-specific. Subjective symptomatology may include nonspecificmanifestations,suchasanxiety,hyperemotionality,fatigue,depressivesymptoms to major depression, headache, insomnia, light-headedness, dizziness, and nervous fits. Peripheral signs are commonly present such as myalgias, acroparesthesias,
and cramps. Functional complains may be present and are non-specific and may
include chest pain, *sine materia* dyspnea, precordialgia, palpitations, extrasystoles
and other arrhythmias, etc. Hyperemotionality, tremor, asthenia, sleep disorders and
amnesic and cognitive disturbances are particularly important in elderly patients, and
may be often overlooked or confused with age-related symptoms.
Elin suggested to name this common condition of persons with mild, chronic,
negative Mg balance, associated with a non-specific symptomatology, as a syndrome
of “ *Chronic Latent Magnesium Deficiency* ” (CLMD) (Elin 2010). Persons affected
of CLMD have a total serum Mg concentration still within the lower part of the
reference interval (latent), and from a clinical standpoint are generally undiagnosed
being considered as having normal Mg status.
However, a chronic low Mg status has been associated with numerous pathological
conditions characterized by a chronic inflammatory stress component. In humans,
Mg deficiency through exacerbating chronic inflammatory stress may contribute
significantly to the occurrence of several chronic age-related diseases.

###### ***9.8.2 Magnesium, Hypertension and Cardiovascular*** ***Diseases***

Chronic Mg deficits have been linked to an increased risk of numerous preclinical and
clinical cardiovascular outcomes, mostly observed in older populations, including
hypertension, ischemic heart disease, cardiac failure and cardiovascular mortality,
stroke, cardiac arrhythmias, atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, alterations in
lipid metabolism, platelet aggregation/thrombosis, inflammation, oxidative stress
(Paolisso and Barbagallo 1997; Barbagallo et al. 2007).
Kobayashi in 1957 first noted that the nature of drinking water might influence
death rates from cardiovascular disease; the incidence of stroke was significantly
lower in areas with hard water (mainly linked to Mg and calcium content) (Kobayashi
1957). Schroeder surveyed the hardness of drinking water in the US, analyzing the
relationship between the death rates and the water hardness found that death rates
from cardiovascular diseases (particularly from coronary heart attacks in white men
45–64 years old) was significantly higher in states with soft water than in states with
hard water (Schroeder 1966).
Mg has a crucial role in cardiovascular homeostasis. Although not directly
involved in the biochemical process of contraction, Mg modulates vascular smooth
muscle tone and contractility by affecting calcium ion concentrations and its availability at critical sites (Altura and Altura 1981; Altura et al. 1984). Consistent with the
above, not only calcium-induced contraction in vascular smooth muscle is sensitive to
changes in Mg concentration, but direct reduction of extracellular Mg raises smooth
muscle Ca content, while conversely, elevations in Mg concentrations reciprocally
lower calcium content in smooth muscle (Turlapaty and Altura 1980). Moreover,
Mg directly affect uptake, distribution, and content of calcium in vascular smooth
muscle cells, and can itself function as a nature’s weak physiologic calcium channel
blocker (Iseri and French 1984), modulating calcium-channel activity in heart cells
(Agus et al. 1989). In view of such direct and indirect actions of Mg on cardiac and
vascular smooth muscle cells, it is reasonable to suggest that Mg deficiency might be
relevant to disorders of blood pressure homeostasis, such as hypertension. Indeed,
vascular hyperreactivity and frank hypertension can be induced by depleting of Mg
both the in vitro environment, or in the organism as a whole (Altura and Altura 1991).
Measurements of serum Mg levels are not useful, since no distinct alterations of circulating total Mg levels have been identified in essential hypertension. However,
several abnormalities of Mg metabolism have long been recognized in hypertensive
subjects. Epidemiologic studies have suggested an inverse relationship between Mg
dietary intake and hypertension, lower dietary Mg intake being associated with higher
blood pressure (Joffres et al. 1987). In aging populations, a gradual rise in blood pressure, a gradual fall in total serum Mg levels with age (Petersen et al. 1977), and an
age-related suppression of intracellular free Mg (Barbagallo et al. 2000) have been
observed, suggesting a possible role for Mg deficit in hypertensive states. Fasting
levels of intracellular free Mg were found significantly suppressed in hypertensive
patients as compared with normotensive controls (Resnick et al. 1984). Moreover,


-----

9 Magnesium Role in Health and Longevity 247

in different experimental rat models of hypertension, diets that raised or lowered
intracellular free Mg, consistently lowered and raised blood pressure, respectively.
Abnormalities of Mg urinary excretion in hypertensive experimental models have
also been described (Barbagallo et al. 1992). Similarly, the ability of a high salt diet
to elevate blood pressure was shown to be related to intracellular free Mg in humans
(Resnick et al. 1994).
Mg was first recommended to lower blood pressure in patients with malignant
hypertension as early as 1925 (Blackfan and Hamilton 1925). Therapeutical use of
Mg has consistently been found beneficial in preeclampsia and eclampsia (Chien
et al. 1996) and in patients with malignant hypertension (Winkler et al. 1942),
while the response to Mg in essential hypertensives is heterogeneous (Resnick and
Laragh 1985). In some studies, Mg supplementation may have significant hypotensive effects, while in others blood pressure may not change or may worsen. A
Cochrane review suggested that there was not yet enough information to suggest
the use of Mg in hypertension despite a small statistical reduction in diastolic blood
pressure (Dickinson et al. 2006). Thus, even if a role for decreased Mg levels in
the pathophysiology of hypertension appears likely, a consistent, reproducible effect
of Mg supplementation on blood pressure has not yet been confirmed in hypertension and further data are needed to consider Mg as a non-pharmacological tool
for treating hypertension. Among the reasons for this are the virtual absence of adequately designed clinical trials of Mg therapy in hypertension, the differing treatment
schedules used in a number of smaller clinical reports, and a failure to appreciate
the heterogeneity of the underlying mechanisms contributing to hypertension. Thus,
long-term prospective therapeutic trials of Mg in hypertension are clearly needed in
the near future.

Mg deficiency may also have a role in the development of atherosclerosis. Contrasting results have been reported on the relationship between serum lipids and
total and ionized serum Mg concentrations. Serum Mg has been found to be positively (Randell et al. 2008) or negatively (Corsonello et al. 2007) associated with
serum lipid levels. Binding interactions between Mg and lipoproteins may, at least
partially, account for these contrasting results, although it is also possible that the
relationship between Mg status and lipids in healthy persons may be different from
that in patients with chronic conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension
(Corsonello et al. 2007). Low Mg status has been suggested to contribute to vascular calcification, altered lipid accumulation, and reduced cholesterol transport by
high density lipoprotein (HDL) (Rayssiguier 1984). Mg has been suggested to have
role in preventing atherosclerotic plaque formation, and to have a positive effect on
metabolic lipid profiles.
Rosanoff and Seelig proposed that Mg may act as a weak inhibitor and a modulator of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA-reductase activity. Mg is also essential
for the activity of other enzymes of the lipid metabolism such as lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT), which regulates low density lipoprotein-cholesterol,
HDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, and thus may modestly help to raise HDLcholesterol and lower triglycerides (Rosanoff and Seelig 2004).

Mg may be beneficial as a support in the treatment of atrial and/or ventricular
arrhythmias, in particular when there is co-existent hypokalemia (McLean 1994).
Indeed, Mg plays a role in the heart’s electrical conduction and Mg deficiencies have
been linked to many cardiovascular conditions. Mg deprivation has been suggested
to compromise cardiovascular health and favor the occurrence of heart arrhythmias.
Hypomagnesemia is relatively common in patients presenting with atrial fibrillation
(AF)(Singhetal. 1976)andlowserumMgwassuggestedtobemoderatelyassociated
with the development of AF (Khan et al. 2013).
Dietary Mg restriction to about one third (33%) of the RDA induced heart rhythm
changes including AF and flutter that responded quickly to Mg supplementation
(Nielsen et al. 2007). A meta-analysis conducted in Canada has suggested that intravenous Mg administration is an effective and safe strategy for the acute management
of AF. An overall favorable response was achieved in 86 and 56% of patients in the
Mg and control groups, respectively (OR 4.61; 95% CI 2.67–7.96) (Onalan et al.
2007). Intravenous administration has been proposed as a very effective and safe
treatment for torsade de pointes, because its application is rapid and simple (Tzivoni
et al. 1988; Gupta et al. 2007).
Major cardiac effects of Mg are prolongation of atrial and atrioventricular nodal
refractory periods, which may facilitate rate and rhythm control in AF (DiCarlo et al.
1986). These antiarrhythmic actions of Mg may, at least in part, help to explain
the possibility that a high Mg dietary intake may reduce the risk of sudden death.
Women in the highest quartile of Mg intake were found to have a reduced risk of
sudden cardiac death (Chiuve et al. 2013).
In patients with severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional classification IV), under optimal medical cardiovascular treatment, oral Mg
supplementation improved clinical symptoms and survival outcomes as compared to
placebo (Stepura and Martynow 2009).
###### ***9.8.3 Magnesium and Type 2 Diabetes***

The link between Mg deficiency and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) is well known.
DM2 is frequently associated with both extracellular and intracellular Mg depletion, in particular in those patients with poorly controlled glycemic profiles, with
longer duration of the disease, and with the presence of micro- and macrovascular
chronic complications (Mather and Levin 1979; Schnack et al. 1992; Barbagallo and
Dominguez 2007, 2015). Depletion in intracellular and/or ionized plasma Mg can
be found in individuals with normal total serum Mg (Resnick et al. 1993; Barbagallo
et al. 2014). Among the mechanisms that may favor Mg depletion in diabetes, the
most important are a low Mg dietary intake and an increased Mg urinary loss, while
absorption and retention of dietary Mg seems to be unchanged in patients with DM2
(Wälti et al. 2003). An inverse association between dietary Mg and the incidence of
DM2 has been reported. A diet deficient in Mg is associated with a significant impairment of insulin-mediated glucose uptake and with a considerable increased risk of


-----

9 Magnesium Role in Health and Longevity 249

developing glucose intolerance and diabetes (Barbagallo and Dominguez 2007). Mg
depletion in DM2 is associated with renal Mg and calcium wasting. Hyperglycemia
and hyperinsulinemia may both have a role in the increased urinary Mg excretion
contributing to Mg depletion (McNair et al. 1982). Hyperglycemia, which is a hallmark of lack of good metabolic control, may have a role in urinary Mg wasting.
Hyperinsulinemia, present in insulin resistant states, may contribute per se to the
urinary Mg depletion and the reduced insulin sensitivity, and may itself affects Mg
transport (Djurhuus et al. 1995). Lower Mg levels may not only be a consequence,
but may also predispose to the development of DM2.
Mg deficits have been associated with an increased risk for the development of
glucose intolerance, cardiometabolic syndrome, and DM2 (He et al. 2006; LopezRidaura et al. 2004; Song et al. 2004). Intracellular Mg depletion, causing a defective activity of the tyrosine kinase insulin receptor, as well as other Mg-dependent
kinases of the insulin signaling, impairs insulin sensitivity and may contribute to the
development of clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance, such as glucose
intolerance and DM2. Inflammation and oxidative stress have been proposed as additional mechanisms by which Mg is linked to insulin resistance/metabolic syndrome.
More generally, chronic hypomagnesemia and conditions commonly associated with
Mg deficiency, such as DM2 and aging, are all associated with an increase in free
radical formation with subsequent damage to cellular processes (Barbagallo and
Dominguez 2007). The hypothesis that a dietary Mg deficit would induce and/or
exacerbate insulin resistance is confirmed by data, both in experimental animals and
in humans, showing that dietary-induced Mg deficiency is associated with insulin
resistance (Schnack et al. 1992). A Mg-deficient diet in sheep caused a significant impairment of insulin-mediated glucose uptake (Matsunobu et al. 1990), while
Mg supplementation delayed the development of diabetes in a rat model of diabetes
(Balon et al. 1995). Higher Mg intake is associated with lower fasting insulin concentrations among women without diabetes (Fung et al. 2003), and a significant negative
correlation is present between total dietary Mg intake and the insulin responses to an
oral glucose tolerance test (Humphries et al. 1999). The increased risk for developing
glucose intolerance and DM2 in persons with dietary and/or serum Mg deficits have
suggested potential benefits of Mg supplementation in persons with DM2 or with risk
factors for diabetes. The use of Mg supplements has been proposed as a potential tool
for the prevention and the metabolic control of DM2. Benefits of Mg supplements
on glycemic profile in most, but not all, studies does not explain whether according
to meta-analysis a net beneficial effect is to be expected. While the body of evidence from epidemiological studies consistently shows a strong inverse relationship
between dietary Mg intake and the risk of developing DM2, research concerning Mg
supplementation in people with or at risk of diabetes is limited (Rodríguez-Morán
et al. 2011; Von Ehrlich et al. 2014). A recent systematic review and meta-analysis
including eighteen double-blind randomized controlled trials (12 in people with diabetes and 6 in people at high risk of diabetes) showed that Mg supplementation
appears to have a beneficial role improving glucose parameters in people with DM2
and also improving insulin-sensitivity parameters in those at high risk of diabetes
(Veronese et al. 2016).

###### ***9.8.4 Magnesium in Asthma and Airway Constriction***

The first suggestion of a role for Mg in asthma was proposed in 1940 by an anecdotal
report of Haury in two hospitalized patients having acute exacerbations of asthma
who had a favorable clinical response after intravenous Mg sulfate administration.
Haury reported that both patients were relieved immediately and remained free from
symptoms for eighteen and twenty-four hours, respectively (Haury 1940).
Afterwards,thepossibleroleofMginthepathogenesisofbronchialconstrictionas
wellasinitstreatmentregainedconsiderableattention,particularlybecauseofseveral
reports confirming positive results of Mg administration in acute airway constriction
(Okayama et al. 1987; Bloch et al. 1995) although some studies reported negative
results (Tiffany et al. 1993; Bernstein et al. 1995). Even in the absence of an acute
exacerbation, the functional pulmonary tests have been shown to improve with the
administration of intravenous Mg and the action of Mg appears to be additive to the
bronchodilating effect of the anti-asthmatic medicaments terbutaline (Skorodin et al.
1994) and salbutamol (Rolla et al. 1994).
Mg has modulatory effects on the contractile state of smooth muscle cells in
various tissues: hypomagnesemia leads to contraction and hypermagnesemia leads
to relaxation. Potential mechanisms for the direct relaxing effects of Mg on bronchial
smooth muscle include calcium channel blocking properties (Iseri and French 1984),
inhibition of cholinergic neuromuscular transmission with decreased sensibility to
the depolarizing action of acetylcholine (McLean 1994), stabilization of mast cells
and T-lymphocytes (Chyrek-Borowska et al. 1978), and stimulation of nitric oxide
(Kemp et al. 1994) and prostacyclin (Nadler et al. 1987). In accordance with this
hypothesis, Britton et al. showed that dietary Mg intake was independently related
to lung function and to the occurrence of airway hyperreactivity, suggesting that
a low Mg intake may be involved in the etiology of asthma (Britton et al. 1994).
Significant positive independent associations of dietary Mg intake and lung function,
airway reactivity to inhaled methacholine, and respiratory symptoms (wheezing) in
the general population were reported (Britton et al. 1994).
Serum Mg measurements are not clinically useful for predicting the severity of
the asthmatic attack, nor are they predictive of the response to Mg infusion, and no
differences were present in serum Mg in asthmatic patients during acute exacerbation
compared to a non-asthmatic population (Falkner et al. 1992). Conversely, cellular
skeletal muscle Mg was found to be lower in the asthmatic patients when compared
to non-asthmatic controls (Gustafson et al. 1996). We have shown a strong and direct
relationship between the intracellular Mg levels and the methacholine bronchial
reactivity in asthmatic patients suggesting a key role of intracellular Mg alterations
and favorable effects of Mg administration in these patients (Dominguez et al. 1998).
Altogether the data are in agreement for a role of a deficit in cellular and body
Mg as a relevant contributor to an increased reactivity and contractility of smooth
muscle in the vascular and bronchial tissues, causing both vasoconstriction and bronchoconstriction (Seelig 1994).

###### ***9.8.5 Magnesium, Depression, Other Psychiatric Disorders,*** ***and Neuromuscular Symptoms***

Mg deficits have been associated with numerous acute and/or chronic psychiatric disorders including depression, hypochondriasis, generalized anxiety, behavioral alterations, panic attacks, hyperexcitability, cephalalgias, as well as focal seizures, ataxia,
anxiety, dizziness, tremor, irritability, insomnia, and psychotic behavior. Neuromuscular symptoms may include age-related muscular weakness, asthenia and myalgias
(e.g., fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome). These conditions are generally,
at least in part, reversible (Durlach et al. 2000).
As regards the central nervous system, Mg deprivation has been suggested to
cause electrophysiological signs of hyperexcitability. In Mg deficient rats, changes
in the electroencephalogram (EEG) were studied during auditory stimulation and
correlated with behavioral alterations. The EEGs showed consistent changes with
spike activity, initiating in the hippocampus and then spreading to the neocortices
bilaterally, suggesting that behavioral changes induced by auditory stimulation in
Mg-deficient rats are due to a Mg-related increased excitability of the central nervous
system, resulting in seizures in deeper brain structures, particularly in the limbic
system, later developing secondary generalization and projecting secondarily to the
neocortices (Goto et al. 1993).
In humans, many characteristic signs and symptoms of Mg deficiency have been
associated with neural and neuromuscular hyperexcitability (Galland 1991). Durlach
have reviewed a number of possible mechanisms of Mg deficiency, which may induce
depolarization and mediate central nervous hyperexcitability (Durlach et al. 2000).
These include the previously described effects of Mg affecting cellular calcium
homeostasis, increased susceptibility to peroxidation, increased activity of excitatory neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, catecholamines, *N* -methyl-d-aspartate
(NMDA) and non-NMDA receptors of excitatory aminoacids, decreased activity of
inhibitory neurotransmitters, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), taurine,
glutaurine, adenosine and K receptors of opioids. Systemic effects that may also be
involved include increased production of inflammatory mediators: neuropeptides,
prostanoids, cytokines and decreased activity of anti-oxidant defenses.
Because of these important connections with the biological and transduction pathways implicated in the pathophysiology of depression, and in particular its role on the
ion channel of the NMDA-receptor complex that is subject to voltage-dependent regulation by Mg ions (Decollogne et al. 1997), Mg supplementation has been suggested
to be useful for the treatment of depression (Eby and Eby 2010; Derom et al. 2013).
No significant correlation between total plasma Mg levels, severity of depression,
and anxiety were observed (Barra et al. 2007; Kirov et al. 1994), although antidepressant drugs sertraline and amitriptyline have been shown to increase intracellular
Mg levels (Nechifor 2009).
A systematic review including twenty-one cross-sectional studies, three intervention trials, one prospective study, one case only study, and one case series study,

252 M. Barbagallo and L. J. Dominguez

concluded that a higher intake of dietary Mg was associated with lower depression
symptoms (Derom et al. 2013).
Mg appears to be effective to some extent in the treatment of depression but data
are scarce and incongruous. Oral Mg supplementation may help in the prevention of
depression and might be used as an adjunctive therapy. However, more interventional
and prospective studies are needed in order to further evaluate the benefits of Mg
supplementation for the treatment of depression.
Mg has also been used as an adjuvant in the treatment of insomnia. Thus, Mg as
a natural NMDA antagonist and a GABA agonist, may have a relaxant effect, may
increasing melatonin levels, and may facilitate sleeping well (Abbasi et al. 2012).
###### ***9.8.6 Mg and Alzheimer’s Disease***

The role of Mg in dementia and other degenerative disorders has been the focus of
increased attention (Glick 1990). Some epidemiological, experimental and clinical
data have linked Mg depletion to dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) although
themechanismsofthisassociationhavenotbeenclearlydefinedyet.Mginsufficiency
and its altered concentrations in the brain, as well as the effects of Mg supplementation in AD, have been investigated. Total serum Mg levels, ionized plasma Mg levels,
and Mg content in various tissues of patients with Alzheimer’s disease in clinical,
experimental and autopsy studies have consistently shown to be reduced (Vural et al.
2010; Cilliler et al. 2007; Barbagallo et al. 2011; Andrási et al. 2005). Mg concentration affects multiple biochemical mechanisms in the brain, which are involved in the
cognitive process, including NMDA-receptor response to excitatory amino acids,
cell membrane fluidity and stability, and toxic effects of calcium (Barbagallo and
Dominguez 2010). In addition, high intake of a neurotoxic metal, such as aluminum,
which inhibits activity of Mg-requiring enzymes, impairs transport of Mg and/or
enhances transport of the neurotoxic metal into brain tissue, has been hypothesized
to have a role to alter incorporation of Mg into brain neurons (Glick 1990). ***9.8.7 Magnesium and Bone Disease***

Mg deficiency has been proposed as a potential risk factor for developing osteoporosis and fragility fractures. Insufficient dietary Mg intake has been associated in
humans with low bone mass and postmenopausal osteoporosis. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated a positive significant correlation between dietary Mg intake
and bone density and/or an increased rate of bone loss with low dietary Mg intake
(Tucker et al. 1999; New et al. 2000). In two thousand thirty-eight older black and
white men and women aged 70–79 at baseline enrolled in the Health, Aging and
Body Composition Study, higher Mg intake, assessed using a semiquantitative food
frequency questionnaire, was found to be associated with higher bone mineral den

sity in healthy older white (but not in black) participants (Ryder et al. 2005). The
effect of selective dietary Mg depletion has been extensively studied in experimental
rat model. Preclinical studies have shown that Mg-depleted mice with frank hypomagnesemia had impaired bone growth, decreased bone formation, increased bone
resorption, osteoporosis, and increased skeletal fragility (Kenney et al. 1994; Rude
et al. 1999).
The pathophysiologic basis for this effect of Mg on bone, however, remains
unknown, although elevated serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines may
play a role. The possible role of Mg deficiency in determining bone loss is confirmed
by data from Rude and Gruber showing an increased osteoclastic bone resorption
associated with an increased concentration of substance P and TNF-alfa in bone from

Mg-deficient rats (Rude and Gruber 2004).
Mg is required for activation of vitamin D and Mg deprivation is associated with
hypoparathyroidism, low production of 1,25-OH 2 D 3, and resistance to PTH and
vitamin D actions (Medalle et al. 1976). The combined effects of Mg deficiency and
low PTH and 1,25-OH 2 D 3 synthesis and secretion may also contribute to impair bone
growth and mineralization and to reduce bone quality, strength, and bone mineral
density. Oral Mg supplementation suppresses bone turnover and may help to prevent
osteoporotic disease (Aydin et al. 2010; Dimai et al. 1998).
A recent report in a large cohort of American men and women involved in the
Osteoarthritis Initiative followed over a period of 8 years showed that women meeting
the recommended Mg intake were at a 27% lower risk for future fractures, suggesting
a protective effect of Mg on the risk of incident fragility fractures (Veronese et al.
2017).
###### ***9.8.8 Mg and Muscular Disease (Chronic Fatigue, Muscle*** ***Pain, and Fibromyalgia)***

Muscle pain may be associated with Mg deficiency. The original symptoms, which
may have been due to Mg deficiency, include weakness and night cramps. Fibromyalgia is a rheumatic disease characterized by muscular pain and tenderness associated
with a non-specific general symptomatology that includes fatigue, sleep disorders,
bowel dysfunction, and headache, among others. The etiology is still unknown,
although it has been suggested that deficiency in trace elements may contribute
to the development of fibromyalgia (Sendur et al. 2008).
There are limited data about the effects of Mg treatment on fibromyalgia symptoms, although it has been suggested that Mg supplementation may have a role in
reducing pain, tenderness, and symptom severity in patients with fibromyalgia (Bagis
et al. 2013).

 - Muscle contraction and relaxation (by means of MgATP and the release of Ca)

**9.8.8.1** **Mg and Muscle Performance**

Mg status is crucial to muscle ATP concentration, muscle energetic metabolism,
transmembrane transport, and muscle contraction and relaxation, while Mg deficiency is associated with poor physical performance. In agreement with the role
of Mg deficiency in increasing oxidative stress and inflammation (Weglicki et al.
1996), Mg depletion is also associated with impaired intracellular calcium levels and
muscle cells structural damage, affecting energetic metabolism (oxygen uptake and
energy production), transmembrane transport, and muscle contraction and relaxation
(Table 9.7) (Rock et al. 1995). A significant, independent and strong relationship was
found between circulating Mg and muscle performance, which was consistent across
several muscle parameters for both men and women (Dominguez et al. 2006).
Mg supplementation (up to 8 mg/kg daily) enhanced muscle strength, enhanced
endurance performance, and decreased oxygen use in young volunteers (Brilla and
Haley 1992). In older persons, oral Mg supplementation (300 mg per day) improved
physical performance, in particular in those participants with a low Mg dietary intake,
suggesting a role for Mg supplementation in preventing or delaying the age-related
decline in physical performance (Veronese et al. 2014).
###### ***9.8.9 Magnesium and Cancer***

A complex relationship links Mg and cancer. In animal model, Mg may exert a protective effect in the early phases of chemical carcinogenesis. It has been reported that
Mg inhibits nickel-induced carcinogenesis in the rat kidney (Kasprzak et al. 1994),
and protects against 3-methyl-cholantrene-induced fibrosarcomas in rats (Patiro˘glu
et al. 1997). Mg acts as a protective agent in colorectal cancer in experimental models
by inhibiting c-myc expression and ornithine decarboxylase activity in the mucosal
epithelium of the intestine (Mori et al. 1997). It has been suggested that a decrease
in Mg intake may increase cell proliferation by activating Ca channels (TRPM7),
which can provide the milieu for the development of cancer (Hanano et al. 2004).
A higher serum Ca/Mg ratio has been shown to be associated with an increased risk
of postmenopausal breast cancer (Sahmoun and Singh 2010). Likewise, an increase
in dietary Mg consumption has been reported to be inversely related to the risk of
developing colorectal adenomas and colorectal cancer (Wark et al. 2012).


-----

9 Magnesium Role in Health and Longevity 255

The relationship of cancer protection and Mg intake is not clear because Mg content in the diet is closely related to fiber and largely obtained from green vegetables.
There is general agreement about the inverse significant correlation between the risk
of cancer and the regular consumption of fruit, whole cereals and vegetables, rich
sources of fiber, micronutrients, vitamins and minerals, including Mg.
###### **9.9 Role of Magnesium in the Aging Process and Longevity**

In cellular systems, Mg is highly required to maintain genomic stability. Mg has
stabilizing effects on DNA and chromatin structures and is an essential cofactor in
almost all enzymatic systems involved in DNA processing. Furthermore, as essential cofactor in nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, and mismatch repair,
Mg is required for the removal of DNA damage generated by environmental mutagens, endogenous processes, and DNA replication (Hartwig 2001). Thus, Mg deficiency increases the susceptibility to oxidative stress and immune dysfunction, which
may decrease membrane integrity and function and contribute to several mitochondrial alterations with age (decreased number, morphology modifications, increased
DNA mutations, decreased biogenesis, decreased autophagy, increased apoptosis)
(Table 9.8) (Barbagallo and Dominguez 2010).
Mg has a central role in direct regulation of protein synthesis and in ancillary
processes as a response to membrane perturbation and repair (Hartwig 2001; Rubin
2005). DNA is continuously damaged by environmental mutagens and by endogenous processes. Intracellular free Mg increases in cells facing apoptosis. Mg raise
is an early event in apoptosis, possibly linked to a mobilization of Mg from the
mitochondria, and appears to be a “second messenger” for downstream events in
apoptosis (Chien et al. 1999).
There is increasing evidence from animal experiments and epidemiological studies, that Mg deficiency may decrease membrane integrity and membrane function,
increasing the susceptibility to oxidative stress, cardiovascular heart diseases, as well
as accelerated aging. The aging process is associated with a shortening of telomeres,
repetitive DNA sequences, and associated proteins that cap and protect the ends of

chromosomes. Low telomerase activity is associated with increased catecholamines
while the sensitivity of telomere synthesis to Mg ions is primarily seen for the longer
elongation products (Blackburn 2000). Several studies have reported alterations in
cell physiology with senescence features during Mg deficiency in different cell types.
Mg-related alterations may include reduced oxidative stress defense, cell cycle progression, culture growth, and cellular viability and activation of the expression of
proto-oncogene and of transcription factors (Sgambato et al. 1999). Culture of primary fibroblasts in Mg-deficient media caused a loss of replicative capacity and
an acceleration of the expression of biomarkers associated with senescence and in
telomere attrition. In addition, a significant decrease in the replicative lifespan was
seen compared to fibroblast populations cultured in normal Mg media conditions
(Killilea and Ames 2008).
Because of the crucial role of Mg in stabilizing DNA, reducing the potential for
oxidative stress and promoting DNA replication and transcription, a Mg deficiency
might lead to an increased genomic instability, inhibited DNA repair, and altered
function of mitochondria, thus contributing to cellular senescence and accelerated
aging (Killilea and Maier 2008; Hartwig 2001). Mg protects against these effects and
against the shortening of telomeres seen with lower Mg, associated with a reduction
in life expectancy. It has been hypothesized that because of the effects of Mg supple
**Fig. 9.3** Different factors may converge in old age and determine a low magnesium status. Because
magnesium acts as an antioxidant reducing the production of free radicals by the mitochondria, its
deficit may contribute to the accumulation of oxidative damage, which in turn may trigger the release
of inflammatory mediators conforming a state identified as “inflammaging”. This term refers to the
low-grade chronic inflammation frequently seen in old age and associated with several age-related
chronic conditions

mentation in maintaining telomere length, it may also have a role in extending the
life span (Rowe 2012).
###### **9.10 Conclusions**

Aging is frequently associated with chronic Mg deficiency. Several age-related
chronic conditions have been linked to a low-grade chronic inflammation and/or
to an excessive production of oxygen-derived free radicals. Since Mg deficits trigger
both these conditions, we have previously hypothesized that a chronic Mg insufficiency may help to explain the interactions between low grade chronic inflammation
and oxidative stress with the aging process and/or age-related diseases (Fig. 9.3)
(Barbagallo et al. 2009; Barbagallo and Dominguez 2010).
It is thus possible to postulate that preserving an optimal Mg homeostasis throughout life might help to prevent some aging-related conditions, associated with Mg
inadequacy, and may lengthen healthy life. In this context, also the possible role
of Mg supplementation remains unclear. Very few prospective blind studies on the
effects of Mg deficiency treatment in older adults have been performed. The possibility that Mg may supplementation may become a safe and economic health strategy
in the aging population is a suggestive hypothesis that needs to be proven by future
prospective studies. **References**

##### **Chapter 10**
#### **Iodine**

**Halyna Antonyak, Ruslana Iskra and Roman Lysiuk**

**Abstract** Iodine is an essential micronutrient for health and maintenance of thyroid
function in humans and other vertebrates. The major effects of iodine in the organism
are mediated by its action as a structural constituent of thyroid hormones, thyroxine
and triiodothyronine, potent regulators of cellular metabolism and growth and development processes. As a component of thyroid hormones, iodine has a crucial role in
prenatal and early postnatal ontogenesis due to its involvement in the regulation of
neurodevelopment, maturation of the musculoskeletal and respiratory systems and
the formation of cognitive function. The adequate iodine status is also an important
factor in preventing thyroid disorders and maintaining proper mental and physical
health in adulthood. Iodine exhibits some effects not mediated by its action in the
composition of thyroid hormones and can be involved in the prevention and inhibition of tumour growth. Iodine deficiency in organism has multiple adverse health
consequences, including goitre, hypothyroidism and an increased risk of developing
several types of cancer. The activity of the thyroid gland changes with age, and alterations in its function can be associated with longevity; thus, peculiarities of iodine
metabolism in older age are of particular interest.

###### **10.1 Introduction**

Iodine (I) [ *Gr* . � violet], a halogen of atomic number 53 and atomic mass 126.9 amu,
was discovered in 1811 by Bernard Courtois, who separated it from seaweed ash,
and was independently identified as a chemical element in 1813 by Joseph Louis
Gay-Lussac and Humphry Davy (Kendrick 2016). Along with the 200-year period
of fundamental research and practical use of iodine, this element has a thousandyear history of application in medicine. Medications with iodine-rich brown algae
*Sargassum* and the thyroid gland of animals were used in ancient China and the ashes
of marine sponges were applied in medieval Europe, presumably for the treatment
of goitre (Langer 1960). Progress in biochemistry and endocrinology from the late
19th to the middle of the 20th century and subsequent advances in molecular biology
made it possible to clarify the biological role of iodine, its metabolism in human
organism and the health risks associated with iodine deficiency.
The thyroid gland, which can effectively concentrate iodine from the blood, providestheaccumulationandorganificationofiodineinhumansandvertebrateanimals.
Thyroid tissue is unique among vertebrate tissues because of its ability to synthesize
3,5,3 [′],5 [′] -tetraiodothyronine (thyroxine, T 4 ) and 3,5,3 [′] -triiodothyronine (T 3 ), the only
known to date iodine-containing natural compounds that exhibit hormonal activity
(Felig et al. 1995; Nicola and Carrasco 2014). Thyroid hormones are involved in
the regulation of a wide range of metabolic and physiological processes and mediate
the main functions of iodine in human organism. These bioregulators are critical for
growth, development, differentiation and maintenance of metabolic balance (Cheng
et al. 2010). As an integral component of thyroid hormones, iodine is especially
required for development and proper activity of the nervous system and brain maturation (Hetzel 2005; Bernal 2017), as well as for the maturation of the respiratory
and musculoskeletal systems during the prenatal and early postnatal periods (Forhead and Fowden 2014). Thyroid hormones are also important for the maturation of
the reproductive system and the maintenance of a healthy pregnancy (Krassas et al.
2010), for the functioning of cardiovascular (Klein and Danzi 2016), gastrointestinal
(Sirakov and Plateroti 2011) and other vital system throughout life. Iodine exhibits
some effects independently of its action in composition of thyroid hormones (such
as antioxidant effect) and participates in autoregulation of thyroid functions (Gaertner 2009; Venturi and Venturi 2014). In addition, iodine exhibits an antiproliferative
effect and can be involved in prevention of certain types of cancer (Venturi et al.
2000; Brown et al. 2013; Rappaport 2017).
Iodine deficiency in humans leads to metabolic and functional disturbances as a
consequence of inadequate formation of thyroid hormones. The spectrum of these
disease states is collectively referred to as iodine deficiency disorders, widespread
in the world’s population (Hetzel 1983; Zimmermann 2009). Endemic goitre is the
most visible manifestation of iodine shortage in the organism; however, most severe
consequences of iodine deficiency include neurodevelopmental abnormalities and
infant mortality (Zimmermann 2016).

10 Iodine 267

Most metabolic disorders observed in conditions of iodine deficiency can be prevented by normalizing iodine intake (Hetzel 2005; Zimmermann 2009). However,
the problem of iodine deficiency in population still remains unresolved in many
countries. Nearly 1.9 billion people worldwide have inadequate iodine consumption
and are at a risk for iodine deficiency disorders, with children, pregnant and lactating women being the most vulnerable groups (Andersson et al. 2012; Zimmermann
2007, 2016). Thus, iodine deficiency is one of the global health problems and attracts
considerable attention of the world’s scientific community.
In addition, iodine is an element associated with global environmental processes,
and its speciation in the atmosphere can contribute to the destruction of atmospheric
ozone (Saiz-Lopez et al. 2012). Studies on the global cycle of iodine, its evolutionary
significance and essentiality for living systems and various aspects of human health
are among actual issues in many areas of scientific research. The aim of this chapter
was to analyze the distribution of iodine in the environment, its metabolism in human
organism and its importance for human health.
###### **10.2 Iodine Distribution in the Environment**

Iodine is an ultra-trace element of the Earth’s crust (mean concentration is about
0.25 mg/kg) with an uneven and highly variable distribution in different compartments of the natural environment (Fuge and Johnson 2015). Its concentration is
generally low in the lithosphere and reaches higher levels in seawater and in marine
and oceanic sediments. Iodine occurs in different oxidation states (from −1 to +7),
with I [–] (iodide), IO 3 [–] (iodate) and organic iodine compounds being predominant in
the environment (Küpper and Kroneck 2015).
A key part of the global biogeochemical cycle of iodine is its volatilization from
the surface of the World Ocean to the atmosphere. Volatile iodine species include
molecular iodine (I 2 ) and organic compounds (CH 3 I, CH 2 I 2 and CH 2 ClI), produced
by macrophytic algae, phytoplankton and bacteria (Leblanc et al. 2006). Iodine concentration in the seawater amounts on average 45–60 μg/L, while most freshwater
systems contain it at a concentration of<20 μg/L with many values in the range
from 0.5 to 5 μg/L (Fuge and Johnson 1986). The total concentration of iodine in
the atmosphere is in the range of 10–20 ng/m [3] and includes both the organic and
inorganic fractions. In wet and dry precipitation, iodine is transferred from the atmosphere to the land surface and infiltrates the soils, where its concentration varies in
the wide range (0.5–50 mg/kg), depending on the soil type and location. The nearcoastal soils are enriched in iodine, while those located far from marine influence
are relatively depleted in this element (Fuge and Johnson 2015). Iodine is generally strongly adsorbed in soils due to its binding by organic matter and other soil
components, while only small amount of the total soil iodine is available for uptake
by plants. Heavy rainfalls, seasonal flooding, soil erosion and weathering, excessive
use of fertilizers deplete the soil content of iodine. Agricultural cultivation of iodine

depleted soil results in the production of iodine deficient crops that increase risk of
iodine deficiency in the residents of such regions.
Iodine has a strong tendency to accumulate in the biosphere and is found in
all groups of terrestrial, soil and aquatic biota. Iodine content is usually low in
natural vegetation (less than 1 mg/kg), but in some agricultural plants it can be
significantly increased by using iodine-containing fertilizers (Medrano-Macías et al.
2016). Marine algae and invertebrates accumulate iodine in much larger quantities
than terrestrial biota, with brown algae (Phaeophyceae) being the most potent iodine
bioaccumulators among all living organisms. The highest iodine contents have been
reported in the species of the genus *Laminaria* with the maximum levels in *Laminaria*
*digitata* (up to 6.12–8.17 g/kg of dry weight) (Teas et al. 2004). To date, more
than a hundred iodine-containing natural products have been identified, most of
them derived from marine organisms (Küpper and Kroneck 2015). Many of recently
discovered compounds of marine origin were found to possess biological activities,
including anticancer and antibiotic properties (Gribble 2015).
Iodine is necessary for all classes of vertebrates for the synthesis of thyroid hormones that control embryonic development, postnatal growth and metabolic rate
(Tata 2011; Mullur et al. 2014). In amphibians and teleost fishes, thyroid hormones
are involved in the control of metamorphosis (Tata 2011). In mammals, thyroid hormones are closely related to the regulation of growth and development processes
(Forhead and Fowden 2014). In homeothermal organisms, thyroid hormones play an
important role in the regulation of basic metabolism and the processes of obligate
and adaptive thermogenesis.
###### **10.3 Iodine in the Human Organism**

Iodine is an essential micronutrient for normal growth, metabolism and thyroid function in humans and is primarily used as a substrate for the processes of hormonogenesis in the thyroid gland (Kopp 2005). Total amount of iodine in the human body
ranges from 15 to 20 mg with 70–80% of it being stored in the thyroid (Hetzel and
Maberly 1987). The major part of iodine enters the human organism via the gastrointestinal tract, including more than 90% of iodine derived from food. Other routes of
iodine entry (inhalation, dermal absorption) have only a minor role in iodine intake
by humans. ***10.3.1 Iodine Absorption in the Digestive Tract***

The biologically available form of iodine for humans is an iodide anion that is readily
absorbed into the bloodstream from the small intestine, mostly from the duodenum
(Josefsson et al. 2002). Other forms of dietary iodine are converted into iodide in
the gastrointestinal tract prior to absorption. Iodine-containing organic compounds


-----

10 Iodine 269

are usually decomposed during digestion of food with the release and subsequent
absorption of iodide.
Iodide uptake in the intestine is mediated mainly by sodium iodide symporter
(Na [+] /I [−] symporter, NIS) that is identical to the thyroidal NIS (Nicola et al. 2009,
2015). In the small intestinal epithelium, NIS is located in the brush border of enterocytes and can mediate iodide active transport from the intestinal lumen to the cells.
Subsequently, iodide can reach the bloodstream, probably through the Cl [−] channels
(Nicola et al. 2009). Closely linked to NIS is Na [+] -multivitamin transporter (SMVT),
also capable of transferring iodide, but with a lower affinity. The SMVT may provide
a complementary pathway for iodide uptake in the small intestine (de Carvalho and
Quick 2011). Iodide is transported via the blood, being weakly bound by plasma
proteins. A small fraction of the plasma iodide is in an ionic form.
###### ***10.3.2 Iodine Accumulation in the Thyroid Gland*** ***and Extrathyroidal Tissues***

Iodide is absorbed by thyroid cells in an amount necessary to maintain an adequate
thyroid function. In conditions of sufficient iodine intake, the adult human thyroid
gland contains 12–15 mg of this element (Hetzel and Maberly 1987). Under physiological conditions, the thyroid absorbs about 60 μg of iodide per day; however, in
cases of iodine deficiency, the level of daily iodide uptake by the thyroid gland can
be reduced to 20 μg or less (DeGroot 1966). Iodide uptake by human foetal thyroid
begins around 10–12 weeks, but increases significantly after 22 weeks of prenatal
development until term. Thyroidal iodide uptake is higher in adolescents than in
adults and decreases progressively with age (Verger et al. 2001).
Iodide enters the thyroid cells via two routes: (1) active transport involving membrane Na [+] /I [–] symporter and (2) diffusion through ion channels (McLanahan et al.
2008). The main stages of iodine metabolism in the thyroid are associated with
the oxidation of iodide and its subsequent organification followed by the formation
and release of thyroid hormones. The formation of iodolipids and deiodination of
iodothyronines with the release of iodide also take place in thyroid cells (Köhrle et al.
2005; Gaertner 2009).
In addition to the thyroid gland, a certain amount of iodine can accumulate in some
extrathyroidal tissues, mainly in the gastric mucosa, salivary glands and lactating
mammary gland (Spitzweg et al. 1998; Dohan et al. 2003; Angelousi et al. 2016). All
these cells express the Na [+] /I [–] symporter and form the major extrathyroidal iodide
pool, which can be maintained depending on the level of iodide intake and the
physiological status of the organism. In these tissues, as in the thyroid gland, NIS
is located in the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells and mediates the uptake of
iodide from the bloodstream (Nicola et al. 2009). However, unlike the thyroid gland,
nonthyroidal tissues do not possess the ability to organify accumulated iodide (with
the possible exception of the lactating mammary gland) (Carrasco 2005).


-----

270 H. Antonyak et al.

The mammary gland during lactation concentrates iodide almost as actively as the
thyroid and secretes it into milk, providing a substrate for thyroid hormone synthesis
in newborns. NIS is present in the healthy breast exclusively during late pregnancy
and lactation, in contrast to its constitutive expression in the thyroid (Tazebay et al.
2000). Conversely, malignant cells of the non-lactating mammary gland have been
shown to express Na [+] /I [–] symporter and accumulate iodide (Tazebay et al. 2000;
Angelousi et al. 2016).
Iodide accumulation in the gastric mucosa and salivary glands may provide the
formation of its endogenous reserve, which can be reabsorbed in conditions of low
dietary iodine intake. From the gastric mucosa, iodide is released into the stomach
lumen, possibly through the Cl [−] channels (Josefsson et al. 2002). Iodide secreted in
the saliva and gastric juice can be reabsorbed in the small intestine along with newly
ingested iodide.
###### ***10.3.3 Excretion of Iodine from Human Organism***

Iodine is removed from human body primarily through the excretory system in the
form of iodide. Renal excretion accounts for about two thirds of iodide cleared from

plasma, and urinary iodide concentration (UIC) is an indicator of recent dietary
iodine intake. The remaining part of iodine is excreted through the digestive tract
(about 1%), exocrine glands and in the exhaled air (Hetzel and Maberly 1987). Under
conditions of strenuous physical activity, iodine can be intensively excreted through
the sweat glands. In areas with low iodine intake, the loss of iodide in sweat can be
equal to that in urine and can partially contribute to iodine deficiency in people who
perform heavy workloads (Smyth and Duntas 2005).
The release of iodine into breast milk is an important route of iodine excretion
duringlactation.Iodineinmilkisrepresentedbyiodideandthyroidhormones,mainly
thyroxine. Breast milk iodine concentration (BMIC) is closely related to the level
of iodine intake and, together with iodine concentration in urine, is considered a
biomarker of iodine nutrition in lactating women (Dold et al. 2017). In conditions of
iodine sufficiency, BMIC is in the range of 100–150 μg/L, but it has been reported
to vary from 5.4 to 2170 μg/L in worldwide studies (Azizi and Smyth 2009). Iodine
content in colostrum is significantly higher than in mature milk (Moon and Kim
1999).

###### **10.4 Iodine Turnover in the Thyroid Gland** ***10.4.1 Thyroid Function and Its Regulation***

The thyroid gland has a major role in the concentrating and storing of iodine and is the
only specialized endocrine organ capable of synthesizing thyroid hormones, although
the expression of genes involved in this process is also found in several nonthyroidal
tissues (Sellitti et al. 2000; Kim et al. 2017). Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH,
thyrotropin),producedbyanteriorpituitary,istheprincipalregulatorofthyroidgland.
TSH is required for the differentiation and proliferation of thyrocytes, the processes
of iodide uptake and the synthesis and release of thyroid hormones. Thyrotropin
itself is under the control of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) secreted from the
hypothalamus (Felig et al. 1995). These hormones together with thyroxine and T 3
form the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis, which is regulated by the feedback
mechanisms.

Thyrotropin controls thyroid functions and modulates the expression of thyroidspecific genes via interaction with the class A G-protein-coupled receptor located
at the basolateral surface of thyrocytes (Kleinau et al. 2017). The regulatory effects
of thyrotropin are mostly mediated by the cyclic adenosine 3 [′],5 [′] -monophosphate
(cAMP)-dependent pathway and involve protein kinase A, but TSH can induce also
the phospholipase C signal transduction system (Corvilain et al. 1994). A number
of additional regulatory factors, including hormones (insulin, glucocorticoids, estradiol), cytokines and growth factors (such as insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and
transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)), as well as follicular thyroglobulin and iodide
itself, are involved in the regulation of thyroid functions and can interfere with TSHstimulatory effects (Deleu et al. 1999; Santin and Furlanetto 2011; Nadolnik 2012;
Pesce and Kopp 2014). The transient inhibition of thyroid hormone production by
excess iodide is known as the Wolff–Chaikoff effect (Wolff and Chaikoff 1948).
In addition to the synthesis of thyroid hormones, the thyroid gland is capable of
iodinating polyunsaturated fatty acids. A range of iodolipid compounds belonging to
iodoaldehydes and iodolactones have been identified in human and animal thyroids,
with 2-iodohexadecanal (2-IHDA) being the main compound of iodolipid fraction
(Gaertner 2009; Rossich et al. 2016). It has been suggested that iodoaldehydes and
iodolactones can demonstrate regulatory effects and mediate the inhibitory influence
of excess iodide in the thyroid gland (Gaertner 2009). ***10.4.2 Membrane Transport of Iodide in Thyrocytes***

The ability of the thyroid gland to accumulate iodine was first demonstrated in 1895
by Eugen Baumann, who reported high concentrations of protein-bound iodine in
thyroid extracts (Baumann 1895), and two decades later the thyroidal absorption of
iodide was described (Marine and Feiss 1915). Significant progress in clarifying the


-----

272 H. Antonyak et al.

mechanism of iodide transport and its regulation in the thyroid and extrathyroidal
tissues was achieved after characterization of the Na [+] /I [–] symporter and cloning of
genes encoding NIS from rat and human in 1996 (Dai et al. 1996; Smanik et al.
1996).
The Na [+] /I [–] symporter, also known as SLC5A5 (solute carrier family 5, member 5)
is located at the basolateral plasma membrane of thyrocytes and actively cotransports
two sodium cations per each iodide anion using an electrochemical sodium gradient
generated by Na [+] /K [+] -ATPase (Dohan et al. 2003; Carrasco 2005; Portulano et al.
2014).NIShasahighaffinityforiodide,whichallowsthethyroidglandtoconcentrate
this anion 20–40 times compared to its concentration in blood plasma. Besides iodide,
NIS is capable of transporting other anions, including nitrate (NO 3 [−] ), thiocyanate
(SCN [–] ), and perchlorate (ClO 4 [–] ) that can act as competitive inhibitors of iodide
uptake (Tonacchera et al. 2004).
Spontaneous mutations of *SLC5A5* ( *NIS* ) gene have been identified as causes of a
congenital iodine transport defect, an autosomal recessive disorder, leading to thyroid
dyshormogenesis and hypothyroidism (Nicola and Carrasco 2014). Conversely, NIS
expression is significantly higher in hyperfunctioning thyroid gland in patients with
Graves’ disease than in healthy thyroid tissue.
Membrane transport of iodide in thyrocytes is controlled primarily by TSH, which
up-regulates the expression of Na [+] /I [–] symporter by either induction of NIS mRNA
or posttranslational modification of NIS molecule (Dohan et al. 2003). Regulatory
effects of TSH on NIS expression are mainly mediated by activation of adenylyl
cyclase, protein kinase A and transcription factor CREB (Portulano et al. 2014).
Estradiol down-regulates the expression of NIS and iodide uptake in thyroid cells
that possibly explains the higher incidence of goitre in women (Santin and Furlanetto
2011). Insulin and IGF-1 down-regulate the *NIS* gene expression, with phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) participating in their inhibitory effects (García and Santisteban 2002). Tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), TGF-β and some interleukins also
inhibit NIS expression in thyrocytes (Pesce and Kopp 2014). Excess iodide was
shown to reduce the iodide uptake due to down-regulation of the *NIS* gene transcription through activation of PI3K/Akt pathway (Nascimento et al. 2016).
Iodide transport through an apical membrane of the thyrocyte (iodide efflux)
to the intraluminal compartment of the follicle is mediated, in part, by a transporter
known as pendrin (SLC26A4, solute carrier family 26, member 4) in conjunction with
several other channels such as CLCN5 (chloride channel 5) and calcium-activated
anion channel anoctamin 1 (TMEM16A) (Kopp et al. 2017). Biallelic mutations
in the *SLC26A4* gene lead to Pendred syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder
characterized mainly by sensorineural deafness, goitre and partial defect in iodide
organification (Royaux et al. 2000).

###### ***10.4.3 Synthesis of Thyroid Hormones***

The central stage in the synthesis of thyroid hormones is iodide organification that
takes place in the follicular lumen. This process involves a 660 kDa homodimeric
glycoprotein thyroglobulin (TG) that serves as an iodine acceptor in the process
of organification, as the scaffold for the synthesis of thyroid hormones, and as an
intraglandular store of iodine (Di Jeso and Arvan 2016).
Iodide, being transferred to the outer apical side of the thyrocyte, is oxidized
on the cell-colloidal interface and is rapidly organified by the covalent binding to
the selected tyrosyl residues of TG with formation of mono- and diiodothyrosines
(MIT and DIT, respectively). This process, referred to as organification, is catalyzed
by membrane-bound thyroperoxidase (TPO) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide
(H 2 O 2 ), which acts as electron acceptor (Ruf and Carayon 2006). Hydrogen peroxide
is generated by two members of the NOX (NADPH-oxidase) family: dual oxidases
1 and 2 (DUOX1 and DUOX2, respectively) (Sumimoto 2008).
In the subsequent coupling reaction, also catalyzed by TPO, two iodinated tyrosyl
residues within the TG molecules are coupled to form iodothyronines (either T 4 or
T 3 ). Iodinated molecules of TG containing MIT, DIT, T 4 and T 3 are accumulated
in the intraluminal colloid of the follicle. To release thyroid hormones, iodinated
thyroglobulin is internalized into thyrocytes by micro- and macropinocytosis and
undergoes proteolysis in lysosomes (Kopp 2005). This process is accompanied by
the release of T 4 and T 3 that are secreted into the bloodstream at the basolateral
membrane. The levels of T 4 and T 3 secretion from human thyroid are 80–100 μg
and 3–15 μg per day, respectively (Hetzel and Maberly 1987; Nicola and Carrasco
2014). Mechanism of T 4 and T 3 secretion from the thyrocyte involves specific membrane transporters of thyroid hormones, in particular, the monocarboxylate transporter MCT8 (Visser et al. 2011).
Small amount of TG molecules (about 10%) can be subjected to the process
of transcytosis (i.e., the vesicular transfer of TG from the apical to the basolateral
membranes bypassing the lysosomes) that results in the release of TG into the blood
(Tuma and Hubbard 2003). Megalin (gp330), a member of the family of low density
lipoprotein receptors, was shown to mediate the TSH-stimulated uptake of TG in
thyrocytes and its transcytosis.
Process of hormonogenesis is regulated mainly by TSH, which stimulates the
expression of thyroid-specific genes, including those encoding TG and TPO expression. TSH-dependent cAMP cascade is the major regulator of hormone secretion of
thyrocytes, whereas TSH-stimulated phospholipase C-dependent pathway activates
the formation of H 2 O 2 and TG iodination (Kopp 2005). Process of iodide organification is transiently blocked by excess iodide (Koukkou et al. 2017).

274 H. Antonyak et al.
###### **10.5 Transport of Thyroid Hormones into the Cells**

The entry of thyroid hormones into target cells is mediated by transport proteins,
localized in the plasma membrane. These include the Na [+] /taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), the members of the family of Na-independent transporters
of organic anions (OATP, organic anion transporter polypeptide), L-type amino acid
transporters LAT1 and LAT2, and monocarboxylate transporters (MCT). However,
only MCT8 and OATP1C1 exhibit a high degree of specificity for iodothyronines
(Visser et al. 2011). **10.6 Deiodination of Thyroid Hormones**

Studies conducted in the 1970s have shown that about 80–90% of thyroxine secreted
from the thyroid gland undergoes deiodination in peripheral tissues with the formation of T 3 and reverse triiodothyronine (rT 3 ) (Chopra et al. 1978). Subsequently,
deiodination process was recognized as an important stage in the metabolism of
iodothyronines and in the iodine turnover in the organism (Leonard and Visser 1986).
In humans, thyroxine deiodination produces about 80% of T 3 and almost 95% of rT 3
(Leonard and Visser 1986). In addition, about 10% of T 4 initially produced, is deiodinated intrathyroidally with formation of T 3 (Nicola and Carrasco 2014).
Catalysis of oxidation/reduction reactions of iodothyronine deiodination involves
three selenium-containing enzymes: iodothyronine 5 [′] -deiodinases type 1 and type
2 (D1 and D2, respectively) and iodothyronine 5-deiodinase type 3 (D3) (Leonard
1990; Bianco et al. 2002; Köhrle et al. 2005). The first two enzymes catalyze the
deiodination of the outer (phenolic) ring of thyroxine at the 5 [′] -position that leads
to the formation of T 3 (the biologically active form of thyroid hormone). The D3
enzyme is responsible for the deiodination of the inner (tyrosyl) ring of thyroxine in
the 5-position, resulting in the formation of 3,3 [′],5 [′] -triiodothyronine (rT 3 ), which is
generally considered an inactive form of thyroid hormone (although rT 3 can exhibit
some local non-genomic effects). Hence, by catalytic conversion of thyroxine to T 3
or rT 3, iodothyronine deiodinases control the activation or inactivation of the thyroid
hormone, respectively. The ratio between these two routes of T 4 conversion is regulated by the metabolic situation in the cells and physiological status of the organism.
Expression of iodothyronine deiodinases was found to be tissue-specific and regulated by a number of factors (hormones, cytokines, growth factors, neurohumoral
and alimentary factors) (Bianco et al. 2002; Antonyak et al. 2002; Köhrle et al. 2005;
Bianco 2011; Antonyak and Vlizlo 2013).
These three enzymes share significant homology of the primary structure and
possess the amino acid selenocysteine residue Sec (SeCys) in the active site. The Sec
incorporation into enzyme molecules is determined by UGA codon and by a segment
SECIS (selenocysteine insertion sequence), which is located in the 3 [′] -untranslated
region of selenoprotein mRNA. Several other factors are involved in this process,


-----

10 Iodine 275

namely: selenocysteine-specific tRNA [Ser(Sec)], specific for eukaryotes elongation factor eEFsec and the SECIS-binding protein SBP2 (SECIS binding protein 2) (Bianco
et al. 2002).
D1 catalyzes primarily 5 [′] -deiodination of T 4 and other iodothyronines, and its
activity leads to the release of the main portion of T 3 into the blood. D1 is widely
expressed in tissues, with the highest levels in the liver, kidneys and thyroid gland
(Leonard 1990; Köhrle et al. 2005). Consequently, both the liver and kidney are the
most important organs of extrathyroidal T 3 formation.
D2 specifically catalyzes deiodination of the outer ring of T 4, without showing an affinity for T 3 (Leonard 1990). The D2 enzyme is primarily responsible for
the local T 3 production in target cells, and its activity is regulated by ubiquitination/deubiquitination mechanism (Bianco 2011). Expression of D2 has been found
inthecerebralcortex,anteriorpituitary,placenta,brownadiposetissue,thyroidgland,
cardiac and skeletal muscles, skeleton, skin and haemo- and lymphopoiesis systems
(Croteau et al. 1996; Soutto et al. 1998; Babych et al. 1999, 2000a, b; Antonyak et al.
2002; Bianco 2011).
The D3 enzyme, which is expressed in brain, placenta, skin and some other tissues,
catalyzes T 4 conversion to rT 3 and deiodination of T 3 to 3,3 [′] -diiodotyronine (3,3 [′] T 2 ) (Leonard 1990; Huang 2005). The physiological role of D3 is considered as the
inactivation of excess thyroxine and T 3 by converting them to the inert compounds.
High levels of 5-deiodination activity are found in embryonic tissues.
Alterations in the thyroid hormone deiodination system are observed in the ontogenesis of humans and animals, during pregnancy and other physiological states
and in diseases (Bianco 2011; Antonyak and Vlizlo 2013). A range of studies have
shown a correlation between the expression of 5 [′] -deiodinases and cell differentiation;
the changes in the deiodinase expression have been also detected in malignant cells
(Schreck et al. 1994; Babych et al. 1998, 1999; Gouveia et al. 2005; Huang 2009;
Miro et al. 2017).
###### **10.7 Biological Effects of Thyroid Hormones** **in the Organism**

Most functions of iodine in mammals are mediated by the effects of thyroid hormones, known as potent bioregulators of metabolic processes. Thyroid hormones are
involved in maintaining the basic metabolism and regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis (Felig et al. 1995; Hulbert 2000; Babych et al. 2000c; Tata
2011; Mullur et al. 2014; Deng et al. 2017). These hormones are involved in the regulation of growth and development of the organism, tissue regeneration, maturation
and maintenance of proper functioning of organ systems (Forhead and Fowden 2014).
Their importance is proved for the maturation of the central nervous system (Calza
et al. 2015; Bernal 2017), regulation of functions of cardiovascular (Klein and Danzi
2016), musculoskeletal (Anwar and Gibofsky 2010), gastrointestinal (Sirakov and


-----

276 H. Antonyak et al.

Plateroti 2011; Brown et al. 2013), reproductive (Krassas et al. 2010) systems. Thyroid hormones also participate in the regulation of haematopoiesis, immune function,
respiratory function and blood cell metabolism (Sukhomlinov et al. 1986; Snitynsky
and Antonyak 1995; Antoniak 1999; Babych et al. 2000c, d, e; Jara et al. 2017).
Although thyroxine is the main thyroid hormone secreted by the thyroid gland, it
is considered a prohormone of T 3, which is able to regulate gene expression. The T 3
was demonstrated to be present in human plasma by J. Gross and R. Pitt-Rivers in
1952, and its role in the regulation of transcription process was shown in the 1960s
by J. R. Tata and colleagues (Tata 2011). A range of vitally important genes were
shown to be directly activated by T 3 at the transcriptional level (Huang et al. 2008).
The T 3 -target genes include the genes of structural and regulatory proteins, those
that participate in metabolic processes, detoxification, transduction of regulatory
signals, adhesion and cell migration. In addition, a number of transcription factors
and cell cycle regulators are activated by T 3 (Tarım 2011). These effects of the thyroid
hormone largely mediate the influence of iodine on metabolic processes in human
and vertebrate animals.

Thyroid hormone nuclear receptors (TRs) are non-histone proteins acting as
ligand-dependent transcriptional activators by binding to the response-elements
(TRE) in promoter regions of target genes (Zhang and Lazar 2000; Antoniak et al.
2000; Boelen et al. 2012). TR expression is determined by *TRα* and *TRβ* genes,
located in humans on chromosomes 17 and 3, respectively (Yen 2001). Genomic
effects of thyroid hormone are mediated by TR receptor isoforms α1, β1 and β2 that
regulate target genes in the presence or absence of T 3 by involving the co-regulatory
complexes (nuclear corepressors and coactivators) (Boelen et al. 2012). The TRs
often act as homodimers, but also as heterodimers with the retinoid-X receptor. The
TRα1 and TRβ1 are widely expressed in tissues, with high level of TRα1 expression
in the cardiac and skeletal muscles and TRβ1 as the main TR isoform in the liver.
Expression of TRβ2 is restricted to the anterior pituitary gland, hypothalamus, the
developing brain and the inner ear (Yen 2001).
Iodothyronines can act also through non-genomic mechanisms that are not initiated by liganding of T 3 to nuclear receptors (Davis et al. 2016). These effects may be
initiated by interaction of iodothyronines with the binding sites located in the plasma
membrane or in cytoplasm. Plasma membrane-initiated actions begin at a receptor on
the integrin αvβ3 that activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade.
The T 3 can also activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway by a mechanism that may be cytoplasmic in origin or may begin at integrin αvβ3 (Cheng et al.
2010). These mechanisms can potentially influence gene expression. In addition,
iodothyronines have effects on mitochondrial energetics by modulating the basal
proton leak in mitochondria that accounts for heat production and cellular oxygen
consumption (Felig et al. 1995). Thyroid hormone can also act on the mitochondrial genome via imported isoforms of nuclear TRs to affect several mitochondrial
transcription factors (Cheng et al. 2010).

###### **10.8 Iodine in Human Nutrition** ***10.8.1 Recommended Norms for Iodine Intake***

Inadequate intake of iodine is associated with a broad spectrum of thyroid disorders related to both the deficiency and excess iodine in the organism. To prevent the
development of adverse effects, especially those associated with insufficient iodine
intake, and to maintain proper thyroid function, optimal levels of iodine intake have
been established by international health agencies for different population subgroups.
According to the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) based
on the propositions of the United Nation Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders (ICCIDD), the daily
intake of iodine should be as follows: 90 μg for preschool children (0–59 months);
120 μg for schoolchildren (6–12 years); 150 μg for adolescents (above 12 years)
and adults; 250 μg for pregnant and lactating women (WHO 2007). When assessing the level of iodine intake using the urinary iodine concentration as an indicator,
iodine consumption can be considered adequate when the UIC is 100–199 μg/L in
the general population and 150–249 μg/L in pregnant women (WHO 2007).
Several studies recommend a higher daily intake of iodine in pregnant and lactating women: 250–300 and 225–350 μg, respectively, because of significant increase
in iodine requirements in women during pregnancy and lactation and the positive
effects of this element on the development of the child in prenatal period and in
infancy (Delange 2004, 2007). In particular, need for iodine increases by ≥ 50% during pregnancy (Zimmermann 2016) due to several factors: increased demand for T 4
to maintain normal metabolism in the mother; transfer of T 4 and iodide from mother
to foetus; increased loss of iodide through the kidneys (Delange 2004). Since part of
the maternal iodine is taken up by the growing foetus and placenta, a decrease in the
amount of absorbed iodine, available to the mother, is more obvious in the second
half of pregnancy (Verger et al. 2001). ***10.8.2 Sources of Iodine and Levels of Iodine Intake***

The estimated daily iodine intake in residents of different countries varies widely,
from<50 μg in the population of iodine deficiency areas to 500 μg and above in
people who regularly consume marine foods (WHO 2004; Zava and Zava 2011; Abt
et al. 2016). In several areas of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and parts of Europe,
iodine consumption is insufficient and varies from 20 to 80 μg per day, while dietary
intake of iodine by residents of Japan, the USA and Canada is higher compared
to the population of other countries (WHO 2004). Recent findings based on iodine
concentration in food samples suggest that the mean daily iodine intake for the total
USA population is 216.4 μg per person (Abt et al. 2016). In contrast, iodine intake


-----

278 H. Antonyak et al.

by the population of Japan is 1–3 mg/day, but in some cases this index is significantly
higher (up to 10 mg/day and above) (Zava and Zava 2011).
Food analysis shows that iodine levels in the main food groups range
as follows (data indicate geometric mean for each group): marine fish
(1294.6 μg/kg)>freshwaterfish(102.8 μg/kg)>leafyvegetables(88.8 μg/kg)>milk
and dairy products (83.9 μg/kg)>other vegetables (80.1 μg/kg)>meat
(68.4 μg/kg)>cereals (56.0 μg/kg)>fresh fruits (30.6 μg/kg)>bread
(18.3 μg/kg)>water (6.4 μg/L) (Fordyce 2003). In addition, iodine concentrations in edible marine invertebrate species vary from 308 μg/kg in crab tissues to
1300–1400 μg/kg in shrimp and mussels (Wayne et al. 1964), while commercially
available seaweed products contain iodine averagely 16–1540 mg/kg dry weight (up
to 8.17 g/kg in kelp granules made of dried algae) (Teas et al. 2004). Consequently,
marine algae, fish and shellfish are the most potent natural source of iodine in
human nutrition. These foods are traditionally consumed by the population in Asian
countries, with seaweed accounting for 10–25% of people’s diet in Japan (Yuan and
Walsh 2006).
In addition to marine foods, milk and dairy products, being particularly important
sources of iodine for children and pregnant women, also make a significant contribution to iodine intake by population. In some countries milk has been shown to
be the principal source of dietary iodine. Contribution of milk and dairy products
to the total level of iodine consumption comprises about 50% in the USA, Canada
and Europe (Fordyce 2003). Iodine concentration in cow’s milk was shown to vary
from 50–130 μg/L to considerably higher levels (up to 2000 μg/L), depending on
the stage of lactation, seasonality and composition of cattle feeds (Fordyce 2003;
Flachowsky et al. 2014).
###### ***10.8.3 Inhibitors of Iodine Uptake***

Regardless of iodine levels in foods, the absorption of this micronutrient in the
gastrointestinal tract and in the thyroid depends on food composition and on the
presence of various xenobiotics that can get into agricultural products as a result of
environmental pollution (Miller et al. 2009). NIS inhibitors such as perchlorate and
thiocyanate present in food can interfere with iodide uptake in the intestine, thyroid
and lactating mammary gland and reduce its content in breast milk, creating a risk
of iodine deficiency in infants (Pearce et al. 2007). Excess iodide inhibits iodide
absorption in the intestine and in the thyroid gland (Nicola et al. 2015).
Plant secondary metabolites, such as glucosinolates and cyanogenic glycosides,
can affect iodine uptake, since degradation and detoxification of these compounds
in the digestive tract lead to the formation of thiocyanate (Gaitan 1990). These compounds are referred to as goitrogens, as if consumed in high amounts, can contribute
to development of goitre and hypothyroidism. Several flavonoids present in plants
(including soy isoflavones) also have a goitrogenic potential due to the inhibition of
the iodide uptake and thyroperoxidase activity (Gonçalves et al. 2017).

###### **10.9 Consequences of Inadequate Iodine Intake** ***10.9.1 Iodine Deficiency Disorders***

In conditions of unbalanced nutrition of people living in areas with low content of
iodine in soils (areas remote from the marine environment, mountain areas, etc.),
the amount of iodine entering the body can be less than optimal demand. Long-term
deficiency of iodine in the organism leads to a decrease in the synthesis of thyroid
hormones and is associated with a range of metabolic and functional disorders that
result from thyroid dysfunction. These include goitre, hypothyroidism, and impaired
growth and development in children (Zimmermann 2009). Furthermore, the iodine
deficiency increases pregnancy loss, foetal development anomalies and infant mortality and is the leading preventable cause of mental deficiency in childhood (WHO
2007; Zimmermann 2007). These disease states are generally referred to as “iodine
deficiency disorders” (IDD) (Hetzel 1983; WHO 1994).
As is known, thyroid function is controlled by the dynamic interrelationships
between the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland and the thyroid. Under physiological conditions, the function of the thyroid gland is tightly controlled by TSH, whose
secretion typically increases when iodine intake declines below the 100 μg/day (Zimmermann 2009). TSH stimulates the thyroidal iodide uptake from the blood and its
recycling within the thyroid, and increases the efficiency of thyroid hormone production by up-regulating the genes of NIS and components of the hormone synthesis
system. However, this mechanism can fail in conditions when the supply of iodine is
chronically too low to maintain an adequate function of the thyroid gland. A very low
level of iodine intake during a certain period can reduce thyroid hormone production
even in the presence of elevated TSH levels. Consequently, depending on the level of
decrease in iodine intake and the duration of iodine deficiency, there may be different
degrees of thyroid dysfunction. Based on the UIC measurement, the degree of iodine
deficiency in the population is classified as mild (UIC 50–99 μg/L), moderate (UIC
20–49 μg/L) or severe (UIC<20 μg/L) (WHO 2007).
In conditions of long-term iodine intake in amounts below the 50 μg/day, the
stimulating effect of elevated serum TSH levels on thyrocytes leads to the enlargement of the thyroid gland, known as goitre. Goitre is usually the earliest clinical
sign of iodine deficiency, and can be regarded as an adaptive disease that develops in
response to an insufficient supply of dietary iodine (Stanbury et al. 1954). Goitre is
20–30 times more common in women than in men, and is most commonly observed
in young girls at the age of puberty. A more severe iodine deficiency (in conditions
of daily iodide intake below 10–20 μg) can lead to hypothyroidism (insufficient
production of thyroid hormones). Although many people with goitre have normal
thyroid hormone levels, studies have shown that more than 30% of the persons in
endemic areas are hypothyroid, despite the enlargement of their thyroid gland (Kapil
2007).
Being the most common manifestation of iodine deficiency, endemic goitre has
for centuries prevailed in the inhabitants of the mountainous regions, such as the


-----

280 H. Antonyak et al.

Himalayas, Alps, and Andes and in areas with frequent flooding. In addition to suffering from goitre, a certain proportion of the population in these regions was affected
by endemic cretinism, manifested by mental deficiency, neurological disorders, short
stature and often deafness. The relationship between iodine scarcity in environmental
components and the development of endemic goitre and cretinism was established
by G. A. Chatin in the 1850s (Chatin 1853).
Iodine deficiency can arise in the organism at any age, but children, pregnant
women and lactating mothers are the most vulnerable groups for IDD (WHO 2007;
Delange 2007; Zimmermann 2016; Nyström et al. 2016). Severe iodine deficiency
in pregnant women can lead to the pregnancy loss, stillbirth and perinatal mortality,
and adversely affects the development of a child (WHO 2007). This especially refers
to the period before the onset of foetal thyroid function (the second trimester of pregnancy), when human foetus is entirely dependent on the maternal thyroid hormone.
Subsequently, after the foetal thyroid gland begins to function, maternal iodine is
necessary for the production of foetal thyroid hormones involved in the regulation
of development and maturation of the brain, musculoskeletal, respiratory, auditory
and other systems of the foetus (Forhead and Fowden 2014).
Daily iodide intake below about 10–20 μg in pregnant women can cause maternal and foetal hypothyroidism and result in major neurodevelopmental deficits and
goitre in their offspring. The most severe consequence of iodine shortage during
the prenatal period is cretinism, accompanied by an intellectual disability that arises
primarily as a result of irreversible brain damage caused by a deficiency of thyroid
hormones (Zimmermann 2016). The lesser degrees of iodine deficiency in pregnant and lactating women can also cause thyroid dysfunction and potentially affect
neurodevelopment in infants and children with long-term adverse consequences. A
study, performed in Australia has shown that even mild iodine deficiency in pregnant
women was associated with lower education outcomes in their children aged 9 years
(Hynes et al. 2013). The authors have concluded that the adverse impacts of maternal
mild iodine deficiency on foetal neurocognitive development are not ameliorated by
iodine sufficiency during childhood.
Being especially required by infants and their mothers, iodine is an important
micronutrient for growth, physical and mental development of preschool and schoolage children. Iodine deficiency in children is characteristically associated with goitre.
Goitre rate increases with children’s age and reaches a maximum in adolescence.
Inadequate iodine intake during these periods of life can lead to retarded physical
development, delayed puberty, weight gain, slower growth and decreased intelligence
with a decline in cognitive function, including memory and thinking skills. The
observational studies have reported differences in intelligence quotient (IQ) between
groups of children living in iodine-sufficient areas and those from the areas of iodine
deficiency (Bleichrodt and Born 1994; Qian et al. 2005). In particular, meta-analysis
made in China has shown a 12–13 point lower IQ score in children of lower iodine
status (Qian et al. 2005). A decrease of 6.9–10.2 IQ points is observed in iodinedeficient children of 5 years old and under in comparison with iodine replete children
(Bougma et al. 2013). The lowering of intelligence due to iodine shortage affects the
educational potential of children. According to Wolka et al. (2013), children with


-----

10 Iodine 281

goitre had a 1.8 times greater odds of having a below-average academic achievement
than children who did not have goitre (Wolka et al. 2013). Similar negative effect
of iodine deficiency on the mental performance of schoolchildren has been revealed
in other studies (Pineda-Lucatero et al. 2008). The adverse health consequences of
iodine deficiency in the periods of childhood and adolescence can lead to reduction
in both productivity and intellectual potential in adulthood.
Adequate iodine intake is necessary for health also in adult age, and iodine status is a key determinant of thyroid disorders in adults. Severe iodine deficiency in
adult persons causes goitre and its complications, hypothyroidism, endemic mental
deficiency, and decreased fertility rate. In conditions of mild and moderate iodine
deficiency, increased thyroid activity can compensate for low iodine intake and maintain euthyroidal state in most persons, however, long-term thyroid stimulation results
in an increase in the prevalence of toxic nodular goitre and hyperthyroidism in populations (Zimmermann and Boelaert 2015).
###### ***10.9.2 Hypothyroidism***

Lack of iodine, leading to inadequate synthesis of thyroid hormones, is one of the
common causes of hypothyroidism, which is defined as a complex of clinical symptoms caused by impaired thyroid function or insufficient action of thyroid hormones
in target tissues (Almandoz and Gharib 2012). Apart to the conditions of iodine
deficiency, hypothyroidism can also be caused by a disruption in the ability of the
thyroid gland to absorb and organify iodide as a result of congenital defects in the
expression of NIS and components of the hormone synthesis system; the harmful
effects of alimentary factors, medications and environmental contaminants; because
of the destructive treatment of thyrotoxicosis or due to a chronic autoimmune disease.
In addition, rare cases of hypothyroidism can result from hypothalamic or pituitary
dysfunction (Persani and Bonomi 2017).
Theinitialstageofhypothyroidismislatent(subclinical)hypothyroidism,whichis
defined biochemically by an elevated serum TSH concentration (above of 4.0 mU/L)
and normal serum free thyroxine (fT 4 ) level (Almandoz and Gharib 2012; Schübel
et al. 2017). Subclinical hypothyroidism often occurs asymptomatically, but nearly
30% of patients with this condition may have symptoms that are suggestive of thyroid
hormonedeficiency. Accordingtoepidemiologicstudies, subclinical hypothyroidism
occursin3–10%ofthegeneralpopulationandismorecommoninwomenthaninmen
(Schübel et al. 2017). Latent hypothyroidism can progress to overt hypothyroidism
from 2–5% (Khandelwal and Tandon 2012) to about 18% of affected patients per
year (Parle et al. 1991). Overt hypothyroidism is defined as a combination of low
fT 4 and high TSH concentrations (Bensenor et al. 2012). In general, hypothyroidism
affects 3–8% of men and 5–20% of women, and occurs most frequently in older
women (Laurberg et al. 2005; Bensenor et al. 2012).
Hypothyroidism,inparticularitssubclinicalform,isthemostcommonpregnancyrelated thyroid disorder, affecting 3–5% of all pregnant women, and is associated with

a higher risk of pregnancy loss, placental abruption, premature rupture of membranes,
and neonatal mortality (Maraka et al. 2016). High TSH levels in pregnant women
have been also associated with an increased risk of developing neurocognitive deficits
in offspring.
###### ***10.9.3 Tumour-Promoting Effects of Iodine Deficiency***

The prevalence of goitre and thyroid nodules is known to be higher in populations
living in areas with iodine deficiency (Carlé et al. 2014), and in many cases goitre
and nodularity precede the development of thyroid cancer. The relationship between
iodine deficiency and thyroid cancer incidence was demonstrated in the 1920s by Carl
Wegelin, who argued that thyroid cancer was more common in endemic goitre areas,
with a frequency ranging from 1.04% in central Switzerland (the area of endemic
goitre) to 0.09% in Berlin (non-endemic region) (Wegelin 1928). In animal studies,
iodinedeficiencyinducesthyroidtumoursandpromotesthyroidcarcinogenesisunder
an influence of carcinogens, such as N-bis(2-hydroxypropyI)-nitrosamine (DHPN)
or N-nitrosomethylurea (NMU) (Ohshima and Ward 1986; Zimmermann and Galetti
2015).
A number of studies suggest that iodine deficiency can have a causative role in
the incidence of breast cancer (Stadel 1976; Aceves et al. 2013; Rappaport 2017)
and increases the risk of endometrial, ovarian and stomach cancers (Stadel 1976;
Gołkowski et al. 2007). ***10.9.4 Prevention of Iodine Deficiency***

It has been proven that most of metabolic abnormalities observed in the circumstances of iodine deficiency, are preventable and can be avoided by normalizing the
iodine intake. The use of iodine to prevent iodine deficiency disorders began with
the research of David Marine, who first used low doses of iodide to reduce the manifestations of goitre in schoolchildren in 1917 (Marine and Kimball 1917). Then the
program of iodization of table salt was developed in the USA and Switzerland in
the 1920s, and subsequently this practice was introduced in a number of countries.
By the 1970s, it became apparent that iodine supplementation reduced the level of
intellectual impairment and infant mortality rates (Hetzel 1983). In 1993, WHO and
UNICEF recommended universal salt iodisation as the main strategy to achieve elimination of IDD in the world population (WHO 1994), with iodised salt containing
iodine in an amount of 15–80 mg/kg. Since then, there has been significant progress
in increasing the use of adequately iodised dietary salt worldwide, and as a result,
many countries have achieved, or are now on the threshold of achieving IDD elimination. In 2015, around 100 countries had national iodized salt programs (Zimmermann
and Galetti 2015).


-----

10 Iodine 283

However, despite the fact that IDD have been eliminated in most areas with severe
iodine deficiency, many countries, including industrialized ones, still show a mild
to moderate degree of iodine deficiency. The IDD remain a global public health
problem, as approximately 1.9 billion people are at risk worldwide (Andersson et al.
2012). On the basis of current surveys performed in 152 countries, 29 are affected by
iodine deficiency (Zimmermann and Boelaert 2015). Globally, 29.8% of school-age
children (241 million) are estimated to have insufficient iodine intakes (Andersson
et al. 2012), while in Europe this index comprises about 44% (Taylor et al. 2014).
Many pregnant women in European and other countries are also at risk for IDD due to
inadequate iodine intakes (Zimmermann 2007). Dietary deficiencies of the micronutrients (selenium, iron, and vitamin A) may interact with iodine deficiency and affect
the response of iodine-deficient persons to iodine supplementation (Zimmermann
2009).
To date, various strategies have been developed in order to increase iodine content
in people’s diet and in the foodstuffs. Biofortification of food plants with iodine is
considered as an effective method of iodine supply to the population and a novel
strategy for the prevention of iodine deficiency in humans (Gonzali et al. 2017). The
use of iodine supplements for feeding livestock and poultry remains an important
way of increasing iodine concentration in dairy products and in eggs (Flachowsky
et al. 2014). One way to increase iodine intake in a population is the producing of
iodine-enriched food products such as bread, sweets, etc. Consumption of foods of
marine origin is also important for increasing the level of iodine intake; however, a
high level of consumption of iodine-rich foods, mainly seaweed, can adversely affect
people with thyroid disorders.
###### ***10.9.5 Excessive Iodine Intake***

Excessive iodine intake in humans occurs less often than iodine deficiency, since
common diets consisting of natural foods (with the exception of marine products)
usually contain less than 1 mg of iodine per day. However, such a situation can arise
when the diet contains a large amount of marine fish or seaweed or when a person
takes medications containing iodine such as amiodarone and diagnostic contrast
agents. In particular, taking an antiarrhythmic medication amiodarone leads to an
additional intake of 3–21 mg of iodine daily (Aceves et al. 2013). Intake of excess
iodine can also occur when, in the context of iodine prophylaxis, salt iodisation is
excessive and poorly controlled (WHO 2007).
Thereareavarietyofdatarelatingtopeople’stolerancetodifferentdosesofiodine.
While some studies show that consumption of iodine at a dose of 2 mg per day should
be considered harmful to humans (Wolff 1969), there are many studies suggesting
that low and intermediate doses of iodine (1.5–8and 10–32mg/day, respectively)
are well tolerated in euthyroid persons (Backer and Hollowell 2000; Bürgi 2010).
High tolerance to iodine is observed in all animal species studied, pointing to a wide
margin of safety for this element (WHO 1996).


-----

284 H. Antonyak et al.

On the other hand, long-term consumption of excess iodine from medical sources,
foods or food additives with exceptionally high iodine content has been associated
with the development of thyroid autoantibodies and may lead to alterations in thyroid
function, including autoimmune thyroiditis, goitre, hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism (Luo et al. 2014; Foppiani et al. 2016). Therefore, it is important to take into
account the maximum safe level of iodine intake, especially for population subgroups
at risk of developing thyroid dysfunction.
The ICCIDD has proposed that 150–299 μg iodine per day is adequate to cover the
thyroid requirement, and the RDA (Recommended Dietary Allowances) suggested
the maximal allowable dietary dose of iodine 1.0 mg/day for children and 2.0 mg/day
for adults (Aceves et al. 2013). According to recommendation of health agencies, a
tolerable upper level (the approximate threshold below which notable adverse effects
are unlikely to occur in the healthy population) of iodine intake is of 1100 μg per day
in adults (Leung and Braverman 2014). In Japan, a safe upper limit of iodine intake
was set by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare at a level of 3 mg/day (Zava and
Zava 2011). When estimating iodine intake in the population, WHO recommends
that UIC values ≥ 300 μg/L and ≥ 500 μg/L be considered as indicative of excessive
iodine intake in children and adults, and in pregnant women, respectively (WHO
2007).
###### ***10.9.6 Effects of Excessive Iodine Intake***

The organism of healthy persons possesses mechanisms of adaptation to the conditions of excess iodine, and the majority of people tolerate a wide range of dietary
iodine levels. When iodide is consumed in large amounts, its absorption in the gastrointestinal tract can be reduced due to inhibition of NIS in the cells of the small

intestinal mucosa (Nicola et al. 2015). At the level of the thyroid gland, the excess
iodide can inhibit the production of thyroid hormones (the Wolff–Chaikoff effect) by
affecting each step leading to their secretion, namely: iodide uptake, iodide organification and secretory process itself (Ferreira et al. 2005), but the rate-limiting step for
these effects depends on thyroperoxidase activity. The inhibition is usually transient
(lasting 24–48 h) and is followed by normalization of thyroid hormone production
(the “escape” from the Wolff–Chaikoff effect). The transient inhibition of thyroid
hormone production is an autoregulatory mechanism that shields organism against
hyperthyroidism in conditions of abundant iodine supply, while the resumption of
thyroid function provides the maintenance of euthyroid state. Mechanism for the
acute Wolff–Chaikoff effect is considered to be mediated by generation of intrathyroidaliodolipidcompounds(iodolactones,iodoaldehydes)andtheirinhibitoryeffects
on iodide organification catalyzed by thyroperoxidase (Pramyothin et al. 2011).
Unlike to healthy individuals, the persons with thyroid disorders might fail to
“escape” from the Wolff-Chaikoff effect that can lead to iodine-induced hypothyroidism. Susceptible persons include patients with the autoimmune thyroid disease,
thyroiditis, amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis of type 2; those with a previous

surgery, treatment with radioiodine or antithyroid drugs for Graves’ disease; patients
treated with interferon-α, and persons concomitantly using the potential goitrogens
(Leung and Braverman 2014). Exposure to high concentrations of iodide in healthy
persons may also lead to a decrease in production of thyroid hormones that is accompanied by a mild increase in the serum TSH level (often to the upper limit of the
normal range) (Pramyothin et al. 2011). Hypothyroid state has been also observed in
infants born to mothers who consumed excessive amounts of seaweed during pregnancy and lactation (Shumer et al. 2013). There have been reports of several cases of
congenital hypothyroidism in newborns caused by maternal intake of excess iodine
tablets during pregnancy (Connelly et al. 2012).
Insomesusceptiblepersons,excessiodineleadstohyperthyroidism,thatis,excess
thyroid hormones in the circulation because of their increased production by a hyperactive thyroid gland. The elevated levels of thyroid hormones suppress TSH secretion
from the pituitary in a negative feedback loop (Sharma et al. 2011). Iodine-induced
hyperthyroidism,alsoknownastheJod–Basedowphenomenon,wasfirstdescribedin
the early 1800s in the context of the treatment the endemic goitre. It has been observed
that in patients with goitre treated with iodine, thyrotoxicosis develops more often
than in persons without goitre (Coindet 1821). This type of hyperthyroidism is much
more common in iodine-deficient areas than in areas where the diet contains sufficient
amount of iodine. The risk factors for iodine-induced hyperthyroidism include long
standing iodine deficiency, latent Graves’ disease and nontoxic or diffuse nodular
goitre (Leung and Braverman 2014). Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism has also been
observed in euthyroid patients with nodular goitre in iodine-sufficient areas in conditions of excessive iodine supplementation. In general, hyperthyroidism is found in
about 2% of women and 0.2% of men (Pearce 2006). Subclinical hyperthyroidism,
defined as low serum TSH in the presence of normal thyroid hormone levels, affects
about 3% of the population.
Besides iodine-induced alteration in thyroid function, excessive iodine intake also
affects other aspects of thyroid health. High levels of iodine intake can increase the
prevalence of autoimmune thyroiditis, as shown in animal model and in humans
(Kahaly et al. 1998; Harach and Ceballos 2008; Leung and Braverman 2014).
Autoimmune thyroiditis is more common in iodine-replete areas compared with
areas of iodine deficiency, and its incidence increase after iodine prophylaxis both in
non-goitrous and iodine-deficient areas (Harach and Ceballos 2008). In particular, a
study conducted by Kahaly et al. (1998) has shown that high microsomal and thyroglobulin autoantibodies titres with marked lymphocyte infiltration in the thyroid
gland were present in six of 31 goitrous patients (19%) who received iodine at a
dose of 0.5 mg/day for 6 months; while iodine-induced hypo- and hyperthyroidism
developed in four and two of them, respectively.

###### **10.10 The Extrathyronine Effects of Iodine in the Organism**

Apart from the participation in the structure of thyroid hormones, iodine can have
some additional functions in human organism that are not mediated by iodothyronines. A number of studies have shown the antioxidant effects of iodine, its effects
on cell proliferation and promotion of apoptosis, induction of cell differentiation, protective effects against some types of cancer, anti-inflammatory effects, and possible
participation in mechanism of cell mediated immunity (Venturi 2011; Swietaszczyk
and Pilecki 2012; Aceves et al. 2013; Venturi and Venturi 2014).
In many patho-physiological conditions, effects of iodine are mediated by
iodolipid compounds, formed in the thyroid gland. In addition to the involvement
of iodolipids in mediating the Wolff–Chaikoff effect, these compounds can mediate
the inhibitory effects of excess iodide on thyroid cell proliferation and modulate the
signals of TSH and cytokines (Gaertner 2009; Soriguer et al. 2011; Swietaszczyk
and Pilecki 2012; Rossich et al. 2016). In particular, 2-IHDA has a suppressive
effect on adenylyl cyclase, which participates in cAMP formation, whereas 6-iodo5-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid δ-iodolactone (6-IL) can inhibit calcium-dependent
protein kinase C and signaling pathways induced by local growth factors. Iodolipid
compounds also show antiproliferative effects and trigger apoptosis in thyrocytes
and some other types of cells (Swietaszczyk and Pilecki 2012; Rossich et al. 2016). ***10.10.1 Antioxidant Function of Iodide***

Iodine can act both as the oxidizing and reducing agent, depending on its chemical
form and surrounding milieu. In the thyroid, iodide oxidation underlies the processes of tyrosine iodination and the formation of thyroid hormones. At the same
time, iodide, by releasing electrons, is a reducing agent and, hence, can perform an
antioxidant function. As electron donor, iodide can quench. **[·]** OH–radical and H 2 O 2 ;
however, iodide can also act as a free radical capable of iodinating tyrosine, histidine
and some polyunsaturated fatty acids in cell membranes making them less reactive
with oxygen radicals (Smyth 2003; Aceves et al. 2013).
Together with peroxidases that transfer electrons to hydrogen peroxide, iodide
can contribute to H 2 O 2 detoxification and reduce cell damage (Venturi 2011). Iodide
has been suggested to have an antioxidant function in the thyroid, mammary gland,
stomach and salivary glands, where it is accumulated (Venturi et al. 2000; Smyth
2003; Venturi and Venturi 2014), while insufficient iodide intake leads to accumulation of malondialdehyde and other products of lipid peroxidation. In addition, iodide
increase the total antioxidant status in human serum (Soriguer et al. 2011), and protect
brain cells from lipid peroxidation (Venturi and Venturi 2014).
Some authors hypothesize that iodide together with peroxidases plays an antioxidant role in all organisms containing cells capable of concentrating iodine—from

algae to vertebrates and can be considered the most ancient antioxidant in the evolutionary sense (Venturi et al. 2000; Venturi and Venturi 2014).
###### ***10.10.2 Antitumor Effects of Iodine***

It has been demonstrated that iodine exhibits an antiproliferative/cytotoxic effect on
a number of malignant cells and has a protective role in several types of cancer,
including thyroid, breast and stomach cancer (Venturi et al. 2000; Brown et al. 2013;
Rösner et al. 2016; Rappaport 2017). Since the 1920s, there are a number of studies
suggesting a lower risk of developing thyroid cancer with a higher level of iodine
intake (Zimmermann and Galetti 2015). At the same time, a moderately elevated
level of iodine consumption can contribute to reducing risk of several extrathyroidal
cancers. In animal and human studies, iodine administration has been shown to cause
regression of both iodine-deficient goitre and benign pathological breast tissue (Cann
et al. 2000). The evidence of the antineoplastic effect of iodine in extrathyroidal tissues was obtained in the 1990s (Kato et al. 1994). Subsequently, it has been found
that molecular iodine, which can be taken by cells through a pathway not mediated
by NIS, reduces tissue neoplasia much more effectively than iodide. Clinical data
and animal studies suggest that I 2 has a suppressive effect on the development of
both benign and cancerous pathologies in mammary and prostate glands and is less
thyrotoxic than iodide (Anguiano et al. 2007; Aceves et al. 2013). Dose-response
studies in humans have shown that iodine at concentrations of 3, 5, and 6 mg/day,
mainly in the form of I 2, has significant beneficial actions in benign pathologies
(mastalgia or prostatic hyperplasia) and exhibits antineoplastic effects in early and
advanced breast cancer, without the side effects of these doses (Ghent et al. 1993;
Kessler 2009; Anguiano et al. 2010; Aceves et al. 2013). Higher concentrations of
iodine (9 and 12 mg/day) resulted in the same benefits, but caused transient hypothyroidism in 20% of the studied patients with minor side effects that disappeared when
the high iodine supplementation was stopped (Kessler 2009).
The antitumor effects of iodine can be mediated by different mechanisms, including direct actions in which oxidized iodine dissipates the potential of the mitochondrial membrane, thus inducing mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, and indirect
effects through the formation of iodolipid compounds (Aceves et al. 2013). Iodolipids
can alter both expression and action of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors
(PPARs) type gamma that, in turn, trigger apoptotic or differentiation pathways
(Nuñez-Anita et al. 2009; Aceves et al. 2013). ***10.10.3 Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Iodine***

The available data suggest that iodine has an anti-inflammatory effect (Soriguer et al.

species. Molecular iodine has been also shown to inhibit the NO generation and
expression of TNF-α in monocytes/macrophages (Moore et al. 1997).
###### **10.11 Beneficial Effects of Iodine in Human Health** **and Longevity**

Iodine is essential for health at every stage of human life mainly because of its indispensable role in the production of thyroid hormones that control the key metabolic
processes in the organism. In addition, iodine is involved in the processes of thyroid
autoregulation and can have some functions in human body that are not mediated by
iodothyronines (Fig. 10.1). As above mentioned, iodine in the thyroid gland can participate in formation of iodolipids that exhibit regulatory and antiproliferative effects;
such compounds may also play a role in the proliferative control of extrathyroidal tissues. However, with the exception of the effects of iodine as a component of thyroid
hormones, other mechanisms of iodine regulatory action have not been extensively
studied. The available data on the long lifespan of people who traditionally consume
iodine in moderately high amounts (for example, the population of Japan) indicate
the important role of this micronutrient in human health, but it is difficult to analyze
the role of iodine in longevity, because of physiological changes in thyroid function
with age.
It can be considered that the most significant effects of iodine as a component of
iodothyronines are manifested in the early period of development of human organism (prenatal period, infancy and childhood). The essentiality of iodine at these
ontogenetic stages is proved by data on the improvement of foetal and neonatal
neurodevelopment and the reduction of infant mortality after iodine prophylaxis in
pregnant women. In particular, iodine supplementation before or during early pregnancy increases birth weight, reduces perinatal and infant mortality rates, eliminates
the cases of cretinism and generally increases developmental scores in young children by 10–20% (Zimmermann 2016). Improvement of neurocognitive function in
infants and children after iodine supplementation in pregnant and lactating mothers is associated with the indispensability of thyroid hormones for normal neuronal
migration and myelination of the brain during foetal and early postnatal life. Iodine
supplementation in moderately iodine-deficient children improves their mental performance due to the effect of iodine on cognition and increases their motor function
and somatic growth (Zimmermann 2007).
Iodine also has an important role in the mental and physical health of adult and
older persons. Adequate iodine intake is necessary for the proper functioning of the
central nervous system, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, immune, hematopoietic and
endocrine systems throughout life. The available data show that adult population living in areas with iodine deficiency are characterized by a high degree of apathy, low
educability, poor performance, lack of physical energy and reduced work output that
contribute to poor quality of life (Ahad and Ganie 2010). Insufficient formation of

thyroid hormones, particularly in older persons, is often accompanied by hypertension, cardiac insufficiency, adverse lipid profile, insulin resistance, and endothelial
dysfunction (Stabouli et al. 2010; Sara et al. 2015). These metabolic alterations create an increased risk of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cognitive
impairment and depression. Thus, iodine is important for the prevention of disorders
that arise mainly in adult and older age and are linked to higher mortality in older

persons.
There are experimental and clinical data suggesting the association of hypothyroidism with obesity (Knudsen et al. 2005; Longhi and Radetti 2013). This is due to
involvement of thyroid hormones in the regulation of basal metabolism and thermogenesis, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and fat oxidation. Overweight is often
accompanied by elevated TSH level (Laurberg et al. 2012). In addition, there is an
inverse correlation between free thyroxine values and body mass index, even when
fT 4 values remain in the normal range (Knudsen et al. 2005). Obesity, in turn, is associated with the presence of insulin resistance (Cali and Caprio 2008), contributes to
the pathogenesis of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, hence, increases the health
risks and worsens the quality of life of people with iodine-deficiency.
Hypothyroidism, including its subclinical form, also has cognitive and neuropsychiatric consequences in adult and older people. In particular, subclinical hypothyroidism may be a predisposing factor for depression, cognitive impairment, and
dementia (Davis et al. 2003; Resta et al. 2012; Joffe et al. 2013). Older adults,


-----

290 H. Antonyak et al.

particularly women, may be more vulnerable to the effects of subclinical hypothyroidism, given age-related changes to the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, and
some studies suggest the possible association between subclinical hypothyroid status
and depression and cognitive decline in the elderly (Chuiere et al. 2007; Joffe et al.
2013). However, there are reports suggesting that conditions of hyperthyroidism can
also lead to mental deficiency in older persons (Kalmijn et al. 2000). In particular, the
findings of Kalmijn et al (2000) have shown that persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism, manifested by the reduced TSH levels, had a more than threefold increased
risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.

It is suggested that an adequate intake of iodine is necessary to prevent several
types of cancer, while iodine deficiency increases the risk of thyroid and extrathyroidal cancers (breast, endometrial, ovarian, and stomach cancers) (Stadel 1976;
Venturi et al. 2000; Gołkowski et al. 2007; Aceves et al. 2013; Zimmermann and
Galetti 2015; Rappaport 2017). Iodine supplementation has been shown to diminish
tissue neoplasia and can ameliorate physiopathologies of several organs that take
up iodine, primarily the thyroid, mammary, and prostate glands and potentially the
pancreas and gastric system (Anguiano et al. 2007; Aceves et al. 2013). This especially refers to the molecular iodine, which, if ingested in milligram amounts, has a
suppressive effect on both benign and cancer neoplasias (Aceves et al. 2013). Clinical and experimental data on the antitumor effects of iodine are consistent with
epidemiological reports suggesting a direct association in the Japanese population
between the low incidence of breast and prostate pathologies and moderately high
dietary intake of iodine (Cann et al. 2000; Rappaport 2017).
The limits for iodine intake of 1–2 mg per day have been established by international agencies, given the fact that individuals with underlying thyroid pathologies can develop the hyper- or hypothyroidism if they are exposed to doses higher
than 1.5 mg/day (Aceves et al. 2013). However, the available data suggest that
only very high doses (>30mg/day), mainly as iodide, consumed by humans lead
to hypothyroidism and goitre, while low (1.5–8mg/day) and intermediate doses
(10–32mg/day), ingested from various sources, are well-tolerated in euthyroid persons, maintaining levels of thyroid hormones and TSH within normal limits (Bürgi
2010; Aceves et al. 2013; Leung and Braverman 2014). It has been also shown that
iodine may act as an antioxidant in the whole organism if this element is ingested at
concentrations higher than 3mg/day (Aceves et al. 2013).
In this aspect, the traditional diet of residents of Japan, which includes iodine-rich
products of marine origin, attract considerable attention. Seaweed, which is widely
consumed in Japan and other Asian countries, contains a large amount of iodine in
the forms of iodide, I 2 and iodate, and the average iodine intake in the Japanese
population is 1200–5280 μg/day (Cann et al. 2000; Teas et al. 2004; Zava and Zava
2011). At the same time, despite the high level of iodine consumption in food, Asian
population does not differ from the rest of the world in the prevalence of thyroid
disorders (Kamangar et al. 2006; Aceves et al. 2013). The studies, conducted in Japan,
have shown that normal subjects can maintain normal thyroid function, even if they
consume several milligrams per day of dietary iodine (about 30 mg/day); moreover,


-----

the incidences of nontoxic diffuse goitre and toxic nodular goitre is markedly reduced
with high dietary iodine (WHO 1996).
In Japan, the average life expectancy of the population is 83 years, that is, higher
than in other countries, an extraordinarily low incidence of certain cancers, low
infant mortality and a lower mortality rate from cardiovascular diseases compared
to residents of other countries (WHO 2010). The main dietary difference that distinguishes Japan from other countries is high consumption of iodine, with seaweed
the most common source (Zava and Zava 2011). Given the involvement of iodine in
the metabolic processes that underlie the normal functioning of the cardiovascular
system, cancer prevention, the maintenance of a healthy pregnancy and infant health,
it can be assumed that statistic indices of Japanese people health may be related to
the high level of iodine consumption.
On the other hand, the available data suggest that thyroid activity changes with
age, but the complex manner of its changes makes a real challenge an understanding
its role in aging, as well as the level of iodine required by organism in older age.
However, there is common agreement around the fact that some kind of reduced
thyroid function tend to associate with increased longevity in a number of species
(Gesing et al. 2012; Jansen et al. 2015). Studies conducted in people of the older age
suggest that maintaining an elevated TSH level and lower concentrations of thyroid
hormones in the serum might be favourable in the oldest-old persons and is related to
longevity.Inparticular,studiesonthyroiddisease-freepopulationofAshkenaziJews,
characterized by exceptional longevity (centenarians) have shown the higher serum
TSH level in these individuals (median age, 98 year) in comparison to the control
group consisted of younger Ashkenazi Jews (median age, 72 year) and to another
control group (median age, 68 year) from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) program (Atzmon et al. 2009). The authors have
observed an inverse correlation between fT4 and TSH levels in centenarians that may
suggest a potential role of decreased thyroid function in lifespan regulation, leading
to extended longevity. The association of higher TSH with familial longevity was
shown in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study (Rozing et al. 2010). It has
been also found that nonagenarians from families with the lowest family mortality
history score had relatively lower levels of thyroid hormones (Rozing et al. 2010).
In animal studies, a reduced thyroid function with low thyroid hormone levels also
appears to be associated with extended longevity.
Although greater longevity has been associated with higher TSH and lower levels of thyroid hormones, mechanisms underlying TSH/TH differences and longevity
remain unknown. The study conducted by Jansen et al. (2015) have shown that offspring of nonagenarians have increased TSH secretion but similar bioactivity of TSH
and similar thyroid hormone levels compared to controls as well as similar resting
metabolic rate and core body temperature. Hence it is possible that pleiotropic effects
of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis may favour longevity without altering
energy metabolism (Jansen et al. 2015).
Taking into account the above mentioned data, the peculiarities of iodine
metabolism in older age are of particular interest. However, to date, there are no
particular recommendations on the level of iodine intake in the older people.

###### **10.12 Conclusions**

Chemical element iodine is unevenly distributed in an abiotic environment with a
relatively low concentration in soils and terrestrial vegetation and a high level of
bioconcentration in marine organisms. In humans and vertebrate animals, iodine
is a vital micronutrient, required primarily for the processes of hormonogenesis in
the thyroid gland. Being an indispensable component of thyroid hormones, iodine is
involved in the regulation of growth and development of the organism, in maintaining
the metabolic balance and in controlling the key intracellular processes underlying
human health and longevity. Iodine is of crucial importance during the early stages
of ontogenesis, since thyroid hormones participate in the regulation of neurodevelopment, maturation and formation of functions of organ systems. In periods of
childhood and adolescence, iodine is necessary for growth, physical development and
cognitive function. An adequate iodine status is also a key factor in the prevention of
thyroid disorders in adulthood and is important for the maintaining proper functioning of the endocrine system, central nervous system, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal,
haemopoietic and immune systems throughout life. Participation of iodine (as a component of thyroid hormone) in the control of gene expression, the mechanisms of cell
proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis underlies its regulatory effects in human
organism. Iodine deficiency in the organism at any stage of development is associated with a wide spectrum of metabolic and functional alterations secondary to an
insufficient synthesis of thyroid hormones, and is often manifested by goitre. The
severe iodine deficiency can lead to hypothyroidism, which is associated with profound changes in the hormonal status and adversely affects virtually all metabolic
processes; moreover, it can contribute to the development of tissue malignancies.
In addition to the effects of iodine in the composition of thyroid hormones, this
element also exhibits direct antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects and can be
involved in the prevention of benign an malignant tumours, including several types
of thyroid and breast cancers. Therefore, adequate intake of iodine is necessary to
maintain the hormonal balance and metabolic homeostasis and contributes to the prevention of thyroid dysfunction, metabolic disorders and tissue neoplasia. However,
iodine deficiency is one of the most prevalent micronutrient deficiencies worldwide,
and its elimination is still a public health problem in many countries.
Along with emphasizing the need for iodine for health and adequate thyroid
function throughout life, it should be noted, that thyroid activity changes with age,
and alterations in its function can be associated with increased longevity. **References**

##### **Chapter 11**
#### **The Nadir Range of the U-Shaped Curve**

**Yosef Dror, Shmuel M. Giveon and Felicia Stern**

**Abstract** Vitamins, micronutrients and electrolytes are essential components of
optimal cell function. Reliable optimal range of their serum concentrations should
be set according to the lowest relative risk (RR) of morbidity and mortality. Optimal
concentrations and adjustment to nadir ranges might minimize the RRs of a long
list of both non-communicable diseases (NCDs or chronic diseases) as well as communicable diseases, and consequently affect life expectancy and decrease disability.
Efforts should be made to define optimal serum concentrations of these essential
nutrients. The present dietary recommended intakes (DRIs) for the micronutrients
are mostly based on data extracted from a “healthy population”, and “normal” values
are defined as a mean ±2 SD and not by the lowest morbidity/mortality. Definition
according to the nadir ranges of serum concentrations of these nutrients, however,
might better predict nutrient requirements than the outdated DRI methodology. Most
metabolites have a narrow reliable nadir range for their optimal activity. The concept
of the optimal nadir ranges is well demonstrated by examples of U-shaped curves
presented here. Thus, optimal nutrient concentrations should be redefined by further
studies, based on comprehensive data.

###### **11.1 Introduction**

Microelements, vitamins and some other micronutrients are involved in all metabolic
pathways within every cell of the human body. Any metabolic process that is activated
by micronutrients, requires a narrow concentration range for all of its metabolites to
acquire optimal activity. Lower or higher concentration of any micronutrient reduces
optimal activity of the metabolic cycle, eventually leading to a decrease in the capacity to support the immune system and to maintain optimal health status. All the
micronutrients are derived from food and supplements; therefore, their serum concentration might be controlled by follow-up of their intake. The main micronutrients
comprise microelements (iron, zinc, copper, fluorine, selenium, chromium, iodine,
molybdenum), vitamins (A, D, E, K, C, B6, and B12, thiamin (B1), riboflavin (B2),
niacin (B3), pantothenic acid (B5), biotin, and folic acid), methyl donors (choline
and betaine), and other antioxidants (such as flavonoids, sterols, tocols, carotenes,
ferulic acid and other phenols). Not all of the micronutrients are traditionally defined
as essential. Nonetheless, for almost all of these nutrients, a nadir range might ensure
the optimal activity of the metabolic cycle. The notion of the optimal concentration
range for each compound in a biochemical reaction has been well established, but
not for vitamins and microelements.

Serum concentration of many micronutrients often runs below the optimal range
because of insufficient intake; concomitantly, however, many subjects in the Western
societies consume uncontrolled amounts of the micronutrients, due to aggressive
advertisement. Therefore, some of the serum concentrations run beyond the nadir
ranges, because of excessive intake. The nadir range for each metabolite should be
determined at the lowest relative risk (RR) for morbidity and mortality. The nadir
range is statistically distinct from the higher and the lower serum concentrations of
the micronutrient. At the lower and the higher concentrations, higher values of RR
are observed.

At different physiological states, such as gender, age, BMI, growth or survival, the
nadir range might differ. Some of the serum nutrients (such as sodium, potassium,
magnesium, phosphate, copper, zinc, vitamin D, folic acid, and vitamin B12) are
routinely assayed and included in the electronic health records (EHR), but without
well-established cut-off values. The normal value ranges, such as those published
by Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine (Jameson et al. 2018), Mayo Clinic
laboratories (MayoClinic 2017) and Lang Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment
(Papadakis et al. 2018) are too wide, and therefore involve RRs much higher than
‘1’.

The adjustment of micronutrient concentrations to the nadir ranges might significantly delay and even reduce the incidence of many NCDs (chronic diseases),
provided that their nadir values are available.

###### ***11.1.1 Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI)***

The cut-offs of intakes, which cause overt deficiency and toxic symptoms (multiplied
by coefficients of uncertainty) were used to establish the DRIs, and these recommendations are still applied (Fig. 11.1) (Sheffer and Taylor 2008). DRIs were essentially
set according to experimental studies, in which classical nutrient deficiencies or toxicities, based on daily intake, were observed (Sheffer and Taylor 2008). Widespread
micronutrient lab tests, derived from an extensive EHR, encompassing data regarding
the prevalence and incidence of NCDs, may enable calculation of the nadir ranges
of various metabolites. ***11.1.2 DRI Evaluation by the Current Methodology Has*** ***Some Major Disadvantages***

a. Evaluation of the dietary intake by dietary questionnaires does not estimate the
individual effects of the absorption and the degradation (turnover) of the micronutrient, while serum concentration does.
b. Dietary questionnaires regarding intake are often inaccurate and require a tedious
task of measurements.

c. The uncertainty coefficients for the evaluation of the recommended dietary
allowance (RDA) and the upper tolerable upper intake level (UL) are not
evidence-based.

The response curve has 5 ranges from left to right: a the deficient range where overt symptoms are
observed; b the range where overt symptoms disappear; c the range of optimal intake; d excessive
intake without adverse effects; e the range where overt toxic symptoms are observed

###### ***11.1.3 Nadir Range and the Relative Risk*** ***of Morbidity/Mortality***

The plot of the morbidity + mortality versus serum metabolite shows a U-shaped
curve with a nadir range. Some nutrients have wide nadir ranges, but commonly the
optimal range is quite narrow. The RR for the morbidity + mortality for a specific
nutrient serum concentration is calculated as the ratio of (morbidity + mortality
incidence at a specific range of nutrient serum concentration)/(incidence at the nadir
range, namely at the mid-range of the U-shaped curve). The lowest risk value is
considered as ‘1’ (reference value), while other values are respectively calculated.
The highest RR is observed at the extreme serum concentrations (the lowest and the
highest) (Fig. 11.2). In some studies, the highest RR is considered as the reference
valueof‘1’andtheothervaluesarecalculatedrespectively.Foracomparisonbetween
some studies, the first approach is more convenient. ***11.1.4 Micronutrient Status According to Serum*** ***Concentration***

Presently, the available data for serum nutrient concentrations in the major databases
of the EHRs is limited to iron, calcium, phosphate, sodium, potassium, vitamin D,
folic acid, and vitamin B12. Partial information is available for zinc, copper, and
magnesium, and the scarcest data is available for the vitamins A, E, C, and B6, with
less than 1% of the subjects the tests being performed for them. Data for selenium,
manganese, iodine, fluorine, chromium, and the vitamins thiamin, riboflavin, niacin,
pantothenic acid, biotin, vitamin K, choline, and betaine are almost unavailable, even
though the methodology for their examination is available. Of note, the scarce data,

which does exist regarding these nutrients, has a major shortcoming, since it is mostly
obtained from sick patients and not from the general population.
###### ***11.1.5 Specimens for Micronutrient Measurements***

Serumisthereadiestspecimenthatiswidelyusedformicronutrientanalyses,withthe
highest prevalence. Within the years, other specimens such as plasma, whole blood,
red blood cells, white blood cells, urine, saliva, hair, and nails have been used for
nutrient status evaluation. These specimens are often used for many medical tests.
For routine nutrient evaluation, however, serum is the preferred one, even though
some specimens, such as white blood cells for vitamin C or red blood cells for folate
and vitamin B12, are considered as better biomarkers. ***11.1.6 The Nutrients for Which Nadir Values of Blood*** ***Concentrations May Be Evaluated***

Microelements, electrolytes, vitamins and related compounds, such as antioxidants
and methyl donors with the medians of the present accepted ranges, listed in
Table 11.1,arethetargetforthenadirrangedefinitions.Mostofthepresentlyaccepted
optimal ranges are derived from big databases of clinical laboratories after careful
consideration by medical experts. However, statistical calculation, according to morbidity + mortality, is more accurate for the evaluation of the optimal concentration
range than inspection by the experts. The availability of the nutrient test results within
the public health system is designated in the table from the highest (1) to the lowest
availability (4). Data availability within the large databases can also be similarly designated. We also present the percentage of US population with usual intakes below
the Estimated Average Requirement, NHANES 2007–2010 (Kumanyika et al. 2017).
Even these data did not estimate the biological biomarkers such as serum concentration, it represents the best available information. Presently, this information may be
used as a guideline for establishing optimal concentrations.
Some other microelements, such as silicon, nickel, boron, vanadium, lithium,
and tin, may be considered for evaluation and calculation of response curves (WHO
1996). Some of these microelements, such as silicon, have never shown any sign of
deficiency, except in experimental animals. Because of low concentrations, low accuracy and reliability, and the interactions with other metals (which are present in blood
at much higher concentrations), calculation of the response curves for these elements
is problematic and is highly variable. Due to low accuracy of the presently available
technology, the U-shaped curves for manganese, chromium, and molybdenum might
be incorrect.

of the EHR are essential predictors for an accurate evaluation of the nadir values.
Inclusion of these predictors expands the data and may enable further stratification
of the RR for distinct population segments.
Currently, the data for methyl donors, antioxidants, and carotenes is limited, even
though those nutrients are very important for the nutritional status evaluation and
presumably also for nutritional adjustment. Inclusion of blood test results for these
nutrients in EHRs databases might be most helpful.

###### ***11.1.7 Vitamin D (Calcidiol) as an Example for the Nadir*** ***Range Calculation***

In a study of 423,000 individuals aged>45 year, a U-shaped curve with a nadir range
for serum calcidiol [25(OH)D] versus the combined data of the incidence of acute
coronary syndrome (ACS) and all-cause mortality (Fig. 11.2) showed a marked statistical difference between the nadir range and the descending and the ascending curve
regions. The nadir hazard ratio was found at serum calcidiol concentration range of
20–36 ng/mL. Analysis including 106,000 observations of ACS did not show higher
serum calcidiol concentrations to significantly raise morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the analysis was expanded to include 423,000 observations by incorporating
all-cause mortality data, and the study period was extended as well (Dror et al. 2013).
Kaplan-Meier survival curves versus serum calcidiol verified the results. The
findings were confirmed by other studies (Sempos et al. 2013; Amrein et al. 2014;
Sudfeld et al. 2014; Julian et al. 2016; Gaksch et al. 2017; Tuohimaa and Lou 2012).
Such validation by different statistical tools and confirmation by other studies are
mandatory for the determination of any formal recommendation to adjust a nutrient

status.

Stratification of the calcidiol data by gender did not show differences in the nadir
range. However, for some other nutrients, consistent differences between genders
were observed (Olsén et al. 2012).
In the cited study (Dror et al. 2013), 61% of the subjects had remarkably low
calcidiol blood levels, with a RR for ACS and all-cause mortality (combined data),
ranging from 1.08 to 2.8. On the other hand, 3% of the population had blood levels
higher than the nadir range, with an average RR of ~1.24. Presumably, the Israeli
population is not exceptional, and such values of RR exist in other industrialized
societies. Similar RRs might be calculated for at least some of the nutrients listed in
Table 11.1. It is still unclear, however, whether adjustment of all out-of-range nutrient
concentrations would remarkably decrease the RRs for morbidities + mortality, and
decrease the average number of months of disability, particularly on aging. ***11.1.8 Adjustment of the Out of Range Values***

The out of range serum nutrient concentrations are not considered by the public health
systems as health burdens, presumably because there is no sound data on the optimal
ranges as they are yet unknown. Calculation of the scarce available data of serum
nutrients, found in the EHRs, showed that a considerable part of the population lays
outside the accepted ranges. Presently, physicians recommend supplementation after
observing low serum micronutrient concentrations, but without a rigid methodology
of indication and follow-up. Many people take ‘multivitamin’ supplements, single
micronutrients, or any combination of micronutrients at uncontrolled amounts and
without a controlled follow-up.


-----

11 The Nadir Range of the U-Shaped Curve 311

Introduction of the nadir ranges into the routine examination of the patient might
provide the caregivers a tool to decrease morbidity and mortality risks caused by low
and high intake. Unfortunately, such a routine has never been practiced and the main
obstacle for the implementation of out-of-range adjustment is lack of knowledge
of the optimal levels of these micronutrients, and how to follow-up such a routine.
Adjustments of serum levels of nutrients might be materialized only after future trial
and error studies.
###### ***11.1.9 Scarce Information in the Medical Literature*** ***on Nadir Values***

Almost none of the formerly published studies has described U-shaped curve and
nadir range of morbidity and mortality with sound statistical evaluation of the difference between the nadir range and the descending or the ascending arms of the
U-shaped curve. Most former studies lacked enough statistical power required to
estimate the nadir values of morbidity and mortality due to scarce out of range observations of micronutrient blood levels. ***11.1.10 Calculation of Nutrient Nadir Ranges***

The extensive data, included in the EHR of the public health systems, may allow
calculation of the nadir and optimal ranges for the electrolytes, folate and vitamin
B12, and validate the calculation made for vitamin D. Additionally, the RR for every
serum concentration, outside the nadir range, may be calculated and replace the
outdated terms of deficiency, inadequacy, adequacy, adverse effects, and toxicity,
which presently are not well-defined. The limited data, in the EHRs of the public
health systems, for zinc, copper, vitamins A, E, C, and B6 might be sufficient for
a rough estimation of the nadir ranges with a limited statistical support. In a small
number of laboratories worldwide, all the other micronutrients listed in Table 11.1,
are routinely tested, but without cross-linking with other EHR data. These data do
not well-represent the general population, because either sick or wealthy people are
checked.Moreover,theinterpretationoftheresultsoftheassays,whichareconducted
on a limited scale, has no sound support for defining optimal concentration cut-offs. ***11.1.11 Clinical Endpoints***

The nadir ranges for the microelements, electrolytes, and vitamins shown below are
based on observations made on the following clinical endpoints:

###### ***11.1.12 Available Nadir Ranges Published in Peer-Reviewed*** ***Journals***

The available information on U-shaped curves for specific endpoints at certain nutrient concentrations or intakes is scarce. We found only a small number of studies for
zinc, copper, iron, selenium, iodine, magnesium, potassium, sodium, calcium and
phosphorus. We present also nadir ranges for the vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D, E,
folic acid, betaine, and choline. Because vitamins are not within the scope of this
book, they are briefly presented. The nadir RR of morbidity + mortality serves as the
reference value of ‘1’.

The collected data on the nadir ranges presented here (except for vitamin D) are
definitely not recommended or suggested as practical nadir ranges, because each of
them was obtained following a single study, part of the studies comprised a small
group of subjects, and the findings were not confirmed by additional studies.

###### **11.2 Conclusions**

1. Adjustment of serum micronutrient concentrations might have a considerable
influence on the health status of the population. Such an adjustment is mostly
crucial for patients with a history of major non-communicable-diseases (NCDs) .
2. Microelement serum concentrations data, well recorded in electronic health
records (EHRs), is essential for the evaluation of optimal microelement status.
3. The current normal ranges of the microelements (and other nutrients) are not
supported by sound data. Some of these ranges presumably cover concentrations
with elevated relative risks (RRs).
4. Serum concentration of the microelements (and other nutrients) are the best
biomarkers for the evaluation of the optimal micronutrient status.
5. The optimal and the nadir ranges of the micronutrients may be determined by
using serum concentrations and the endpoint parameters of the EHRs.
6. Presently, for most of the microelements, only a limited number of assays of
serum concentrations in the population are available.
7. Adjustment of the micronutrient status must be strictly followed-up.
