#### **Preface**

The book you hold in your hand (or see on your screen as the case may be) came to
be out of a growing necessity. As physicians who see patients on a daily basis, we
are constantly inundated with questions about different supplements. *I heard X is*
*good for Y. My uncle said I should take Turmeric, is he right* ? It would be wrong to
say that doctors receive inadequate training on supplements, including how they
work, why they work or don’t work, how we should evaluate them, which ones
might be dangerous, how do you select the best brand and so forth. The truth is, we
receive basically no training on these subjects. It is barely touched on in medical
school, residency, or fellowship.

Fortunately, as doctors, we do receive plenty of training in critical thinking, an
ability to soberly scrutinize literature, and of course we are equipped with an up-to-­
date understanding of the human body, including its physiology and pathophysiol­
ogy, as science has progressed. Armed with these tools and understandings, we set
out to analyze the current state of our science and evidence-based understanding of
supplements.

The results of our work are the pages in front of you. We wrote these pages for
ourselves as much as for you. As care providers answering our patients’ pressing
questions, and as humans and patients ourselves, we all are interested in healthy
living and are all curious about which supplements are actually worth taking for
different circumstances. This book provides the most current and responsibly
informed answers to those important questions.

#### **Introduction**

In today’s dynamic and evolving medical landscape, physicians understand that
many—perhaps most—of their patients are taking at least one supplement. Many
patients are taking whole handfuls of supplements. Patients come into doctors’
offices with questions about a wide array of supplements. They heard about a sup­
plement online or from a friend and they want to know what the supplement is and
is it safe and effective. Should they take it? Will the supplement interact with their
medications? How does the supplement work to help solve their specific problems?
Patients have many questions about supplements, but are physicians and other
healthcare professionals in a position to answer them? Where do doctors get their
information? Are doctors seeking information about supplements in the same way
that their patients are? Is everyone relying on a handful of websites to get it right?

This book offers an authoritative, evidence-based reference book that healthcare
professionals can turn to in order to educate themselves and their patients with accu­
rate information about various kinds of supplements. This book answers the follow­
ing critical questions—What is the supplement? What is it used for? How does the
supplement work? What dosage works best and for which people? What are the
safety concerns and how does the supplement interact with other medications and/
or other supplements? And, finally, but equally importantly, what is the scientific
evidence, if any, for all of these answers? With *A Clinician’s Evidence-Based Guide*
*to Supplements*, physicians and other healthcare providers finally have a trustworthy
reference they can turn to in order to answer these pressing questions.

##### **Chapter 1**
#### **Acarbose–Creatine**

**Carley Trentman, Laurenie Louissaint, and Ovie Enaohwo**
###### **Acarbose**

- **What is it and how does it work in the body?**

–– Acarbose is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor. It competitively binds to

α-glucosidase, which acts on the absorption of carbohydrates in the small
intestine. It causes optimal inhibition of postprandial increases in glucose,
insulin, and triglycerides.

- **What is it used for and at what dosage?**

–– Although most commonly known for its use in type 2 diabetes, other studies

have its cardioprotective effects as well as helping patient with metabolic
syndrome.
–– Acarbose is typically dispensed in 25, 50, and 100 mg tablets its maximum

dose is 50 mg q8hr for individuals weighing less than 60 kg and 100 mg for
those weighing greater than 100 mg q8hr. With its most commonly prescribed
to treat type 2 DM.

- **Evidence for or against its different uses:**

–– The STOP-NIDDM randomized trial showed evidence that acarbose signifi­

cantly increased reversion of impaired glucose tolerance to normal glucose
tolerance [1].

2 C. Trentman et al.

–– Acarbose could be used, either as an alternative or in addition to changes in

lifestyle, to delay development of type 2 diabetes in patients with impaired
glucose tolerance. Acarbose monotherapy was also shown to be beneficial in
reducing triglyceride levels in obese or overweight patients and did not result
in hypoglycemia during medication [2]. Participants with metabolic syn­
drome treated with acarbose experienced a decrease in weight and abdominal
obesity as well as the inflammatory and cardiovascular markers, including
flow-­mediated dilation (FMD), intima media thickness (IMT), epicardial fat
thickness (EFT), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels [3].

- **Safety concerns, side effects, and precautions:**

–– No serious side effects have been reported during treatment with acarbose

although it is associated with a high incidence of troublesome gastrointestinal
symptoms such as flatulence, abdominal distension, and diarrhea. The inci­
dence of these reactions usually decreases with time.

- **Interactions with medications:**

–– Acarbose administered during excessive alcohol consumption has shown to

affect glycemic control and produce a disulfaram-like reaction. Digoxin
absorption can be lowered by approximately 57–62% when coadministered
with Acarbose, regardless of its dosing [4]. Multiple dose of acarbose impacts
the peak concentration of metformin and lowers the value 30% and extent of
absorption by over 35% [5, 6].
###### **3-Acetyl-7-Oxo-Dehydroepiandrosterone**

- **What is it and how does it work in the body?**

–– 3-Acetyl-7-oxo-dehydroepiandrosterone (7-oxo-DHEA) is a dietary supple­

ment that is a naturally occurring metabolite of the adrenal steroid
DHEA. 7-oxo-DHEA differs from DHEA in that it has no androgenic activity,
nor it is converted into estrogens.

- **What is it used for/what dosage?**

–– Studies have discussed 7-oxo-DHEA use in bodyweight and body fat reduc­

tion and increase lean body mass. It is well tolerated at dosing ranging from
200 to 400 mg daily.

- **Evidence for or against its different uses (broken down by evidence for**

**each use):**

–– In a randomized controlled trial 7-oxo-DHEA combined with moderate exer­

cise and a reduced-calorie diet significantly reduces body weight and body fat
compared with exercise and a reduced-calorie diet alone. It was also found to

have a thermogenic effect by significantly elevate T3 levels although it did not
affect TSH or T4 levels. Hence not adversely affecting thyroid function in the
short term [7].
–– It was also found to increase lean body mass (WMD: 0.45 kg, 95% CI:

0.15–0.75, *p* = 0.004) [8]. We could reasonably expect to see at least 69%

−
of the 7-oxo-DHEA group achieving a meaningful >5% weight loss at
6 months.

- **Safety concerns, side effects, and precautions:**

–– Unlike DHEA, 7-oxo-DHEA does not cause alterations of sex hormone levels

seen in the transformation of DHEA to testosterone and estrogen.

- **Interactions with medications:**

–– No drug interactions were noted in the observed studies [9].
###### **ATP**

- **What is it and how does it work in the body?**

–– Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is an important biological molecule in all liv­

ing organisms. It is made up of three subunits, namely an adenine base, a
5-carbon ribose sugar, and a triphosphate. In living organisms, ATP is typi­
cally produced in a series of reactions in the presence of enzymes, mainly in
the mitochondria and chloroplasts of living cells. The main function of ATP is
usage as a major form of energy currency in living organisms [10].

- **What is it used for and at what dosage?**

–– It has been used to increase strength and power, improve body composition,

maintain muscle health during stress, increase recovery, and reduce pain.
–– Additionally, other literature indicates a role for ATP in improving cardiovas­

cular health. Studies performed show safe dosing ranging from 100 to
400 mg daily.

- **Evidence for or against its different** **uses (broken down by evidence for**

**each use):**

–– In an experimental study by Jordan et al., three groups of nine healthy men

received ATP (150 or 225 mg) or placebo for 14 days. Participants’ physical
performance and muscular strength and strength endurance (1RM), repeti­
tions to fatigue during set 1 of posttesting, and total lifting volume at post
(22%; *p* < 0.003) were positively affected [11].
–– Rathmacher et al. further supported ATP’s performance enhancing abilities in

their three sets of 50 maximal knee extensions to induce fatigue after supple­
menting with ATP (two doses of 200 mg/day) or placebo using a randomized,


-----

C. Trentman et al.

double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design seem to enhance resis­
tance to the accumulation of fatigue that inevitably results from maximal
muscular contractions [12].
–– In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 21 resistance-trained

males were supplemented with either 400 mg/day of ATP or placebo in con­
junction with a 12-week heavy resistance training program resulted in lean
mass gains in both groups, but changes were found to be significantly greater
in the ATP.



- **Safety concerns, side effects, and precautions:**

–– Although not reported in any formal studies, with uric acid as a metabolite of

ATP, it is worth considering hyperuricemia as a risk factor for gout and its
association with hypertension [13].

- **Interactions with medications:**

–– No known interactions with medication were reported.
###### **Alpha Lipoic Acid**

- **What is it and how does it work in the body?**

–– Alpha Lipoic acid (ALA), also known as thioctic acid, is a natural short-chain

fatty acid. It is an essential cofactor of dehydrogenase enzymes and involved
in mitochondrial macronutrient metabolism. It has largely been used world­
wide as a dietary supplement. ALA has antioxidant characteristics that unlike
most other antioxidants, is both water- and fat-soluble; thus, it can reach eas­
ily into tissues composed of fat, such as the nervous system as well as those
mainly of water such as the cardiovascular system.

- **What is it used for and at what dosage?**

–– As described above, ALA acts within the nervous system in diabetic neuropa­

thy, Alzheimer’s disease, as an analgesic and even improving behavior.
–– Effective dosing in studies ranged from 6000 mg daily up to 1800 mg daily

(600 mg three times daily).

- **Evidence for or against its different uses:**

–– The Alpha Lipoic Acid in Diabetic Neuropathy (ALADIN) trials (I–III) were

successful multicenter studies that supported the efficacy of ALA in alleviat­
ing diabetic neuropathic pain and safe dosing. Although ineffective in glucose
control (Hgb A1c unchanged) the ALADIN trial showed ALA’s benefits in
symptomatic relief (total symptom score, neuropathy impairment score, etc.)
and improvements in electrophysiological nerve measurements [14].

–– Postoperative administration of ALA was associated with a reduced incidence

of postoperative pillar pain (frequent symptom following carpal tunnel
release) compared with placebo. The difference was statistically significant
although groups were slightly underpowered [15].
–– Dayong’s animal study showed a potential benefit of ALA in traumatic brain

injury simulated by a weight drop injury model in rats. ALA was administered
via intraperitoneal injection after TBI-induced neuron cell apoptosis and
improved neurobehavioral function [16].
–– ALA was also found to have cardioprotective properties. Supplementation

with 1200 mg ALA after 8 weeks resulted in a substantial reduction in the risk
of CVD in type 2 diabetic patient via a decrease in biomarkers such as ox-­
LDL and Lp-PLA2 mass and improvement in Lp-PLA2 distribution between
HDL and apoB-containing lipoproteins [17].
–– ALA treatment coincided with a 1.27 kg (confidence interval = 0.25–2.29)

greater mean weight loss compared with the placebo group and an overall
mean BMI difference of −0.43 kg/m [2] (confidence interval = −0.82 to −0.03)
was found between the ALA and placebo groups [18].
–– On the contrary, some concerns have been recently raised regarding ALA,

after some reports suggesting a direct causal link between its use and insulin
autoimmune syndrome (IAS, Hirata’s disease) due to its sulfhydryl group.
About 50% IAS development cases are associated with drugs or dietary sup­
plements containing a sulfur or sulfhydryl group [19].

- **Safety concerns, side effects, and precautions:**

–– ALADIN trials reported side effects such as gastrointestinal distress, head­

aches, skin irritation, and possible hypoglycemia associated with 1200 mg/
day of parenteral ALA. It may also cause mineral shortages, and iron level
should be periodically monitored [14].

- **Interactions with medications:**

–– Co-administering ALA with Valproic Acid (VA) exhibited significant inhibi­

tion on the β-oxidation of VA, particularly on the formation of
VA-CoA. Separate dosing at least 2 h apart from any medication that chelate
such as antiacids [20].
###### **Alpha-Tocopherol (Vitamin E)**

- **What is it and how does it work in the body?**

–– Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin which forms a group (i.e., chroman-6-ols),

collectively termed tocochromanols (divided into tocopherols and tocotri­
enols). Alpha- and gamma-tocopherols are the two major forms of the vita­
min. Vitamin E acts as a potent chain-breaking antioxidant that inhibits the


-----

6 C. Trentman et al.

production of reactive oxygen species molecules when fat undergoes oxida­
tion and during the propagation of free radical reactions. A build-up of reac­
tive oxygen species in cells may cause damage to DNA, RNA, and proteins
and may cause cell death at the microscopic level that leads to pathology in
the human body [21].

- **What is it used for and at what dosage?**

–– As an antioxidant Vitamin E works in preventing the oxidative process linked

to numerous possible conditions and diseases including cancer, aging, arthri­
tis, and cataracts. It also helps prevent or delay the chronic diseases associated
with reactive oxygen species molecules [21].
–– Vitamin E is found in various foods and oils. Nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils

contain high amounts of alpha-tocopherol, and significant amounts are also
available in green leafy vegetables and fortified cereals. When obtained from
food sources alone, Vitamin E has no documented evidence of toxicity.
Studies have shown tolerated dosing ranging from 400 to 2000 IU/day [21].

- **Evidence for or against its different uses (broken down by evidence for**

**each use):**

–– The trial of Vitamin E and Memantine in Alzheimer’s Disease (TEAM-AD)

trial showed that with 2000 IU/day of alpha-tocopherol (Vitamin E) patient
with significantly delayed clinical progression in ADLs with mild-to-­moderate
AD who were taking an AChEI. This effect was not seen in the memantine
and the memantine plus alpha-tocopherol groups. A delay in the annual rate
of clinical progression in the alpha-tocopherol group of 19% or approximately
6.2 months was seen over the follow-up period [22].
–– In 2007, reports from the Women’s Health Study (WHS) demonstrated that

Vitamin E supplements decrease the risk of mortality from thromboembolism
and that alpha-tocopherol decreases the tendency for clotting in normal
healthy women [23].
–– The SELECT trial showed the negative effects of Vitamin E supplementation.

Healthy men with average risk of prostate cancer subjected to contemporary
community standards of screening and biopsy who took a common dose and
formulation of Vitamin E (400 IU/day) had an observed 17% increase in pros­
tate cancer incidence compared to patients treated with a placebo [24].
–– Poston’s VIP trial revealed an increase in low birthweight and no benefit with

respect to risk of pre-eclampsia suggests a contraindication of the studied
doses of Vitamin C and Vitamin E in pregnancy [25].

- **Safety concerns, side effects, and precautions:**

–– Concomitant supplementation with Vitamin C and Vitamin E increase the rate

of babies born with a low birthweight and an increased risk for prostate can­
cer [26].

–– Vitamin E is heavily dependent on Vitamin C, Vitamin B3, selenium, and

glutathione [21].
###### **Arginine-Alpha-Ketoglutarate**

- **How it works?**

–– Arginine-alpha-ketoglurarate (AAKG) has the main role in acting as an ergo­

genic aid to increase nitric oxide in the bloodstream resulting in vasodilation.
This occurs by supplying the precursor for nitric oxide synthase (NOS),
l-arginine. l-Arginine is then metabolized into l-citrulline, producing nitric
oxide in the process. This nitric oxide production would then in turn cause
vasodilation which would increase oxygen and nutrient delivery to muscles
resulting in muscle hypertrophy [27, 28].

- **What is it used for/dosage?**

–– AAKG is used for muscle hypertrophy [27].

- **Evidence for or against its use:**

–– There is much less published data on AAKG compared to l-arginine, and

from the data examined, the efficacy is unclear.
–– A double-blind placebo trial examined the biomarker effect on a 7-day AAKG

supplementation (NO 2 Platinum) on various biomarkers. This included 24
active males who were prescribed 12 g/day or a placebo for 7 days resistance
training. Three samples were collected at intervals of prior to initiation of
exercise, immediately post-exercise, and 30 min after exercise. The results
suggest that AAKG increased plasma l-arginine levels, but the increase in
nitric oxide after exercise were not statistically significant between the sup­
plementation group and placebo group, suggesting AAKG did not have any
influence on nitric oxide levels [27].

- **Safety concerns, side effects, and precautions:**

–– So far, there have been four adverse events published while taking AAKG

supplementation. In a case series published by Prosser and colleagues, there
were three patients with adverse events after ingesting AAKG. The first was a
22-year-old male who ingested three “NO 2 Platinum” tablets who subse­
quently developed palpitations, dizziness, generalized numbness, and persis­
tent vomiting. He was admitted overnight for observation and was discharged
the next day. The second patient was a 21-year-old male who ingested one
tablet of a “nitric oxide” tablet who developed palpitations and near syncope
while lifting weights. He was admitted and required IV fluids with resolution
of his symptoms the following day. The third was a 24-year-old male who had


-----

8 C. Trentman et al.

palpitations and a headache 45 min after AAKG ingestion. He was treated
with acetaminophen and sent home [28].
–– The only other adverse occurring after AAKG supplementation recorded was

a patient who underwent laser in situ keratomileusis procedure. Postoperatively,
the patient developed subconjunctival hemorrhages, dilated circumcorneal
vessels, and corneal infiltrates—the authors hypothesize that the vasodilatory
and antithrombotic effects lead to these complications [29].

- **Interactions with other medications:**

–– There have been no documented interactions of AAKG with other medica­

tions [30].
###### **Ascorbic Acid**

- **How it works?**

–– Ascorbic acid (AA), or Vitamin C, acts as a biological antioxidant. This works

as a substance that prevents the oxidation of important biomolecules such as
fatty acids, DNA, or proteins from a reactive oxygen species. It is found in
fruits and vegetables, especially strawberries, citrus, kiwi, brussels sprouts,
and cauliflower [31].

- **What is it used for/dosage?**

–– Ascorbic acid is utilized for the prevention and treatment of scurvy, macular

degeneration, respiratory infections, and idiopathic methemoglobinemia

[32–34]. This literature review will examine the efficacy of ascorbic acid as a
supplementation.
–– The recommended dietary allowance for men greater than 19 years of age is

90 mg daily and for women greater than 19 years of age is 75 mg daily [35].

- **Evidence for or against its use:**

–– There are mixed studies that support the efficacy of ascorbic acid supplemen­

tation in improving glycemic outcomes. A recent study assessed 31 individu­
als with type 2 diabetes and its effect on postprandial glucose responses under
free-living conditions demonstrated improved postprandial and 24-h hyper­
glycemia and decreased blood pressure after 4 months of supplementation
compared to placebo [36].

- **Safety** **concerns, side effects, and precautions:**

–– If the supplement is paired with sodium (sodium ascorbate), this contains

approximately 5 mEq of sodium and must be taken with caution in sodium-­
restricted diet patients.

–– Renal calculi have also been reported in patients with renal disease taking

large doses of ascorbic acid; however, no kidney stone formation was observed
in healthy individuals even with excess AA intake. There are also some AA
injections that contain aluminum, therefore premature neonates with imma­
ture kidneys or individuals with renal disease must be treated with cau­
tion [37].

- **Interactions with other medications:**

–– Ascorbic acid interacts with aspirin by increased urinary excretion of ascorbic

acid and decreased excretion of aspirin with concomitant administration. In
addition, taking fluphenazine with AA can decrease fluphenazine concentra­
tions. It can increase GI absorption of iron. Finally, there is a possibility that
it can decrease the anticoagulant effect although not all investigators observed
this effect [32].
###### **Biotin (Also Known as Vitamin B7 or Vitamin H)**

- **How it works?**

–– There are biotin-dependent carboxylases that biotin acts as a coenzyme for.

These carboxylases act in essential processes such as gluconeogenesis, amino
acid metabolism, ATP production, regulation of oxidative stress, regulation of
immunologic and inflammatory function, and fatty acid synthesis [38].

- **What is it used for?**

–– A major claim biotin supplementation can help with is to have longer and

healthier nails and hair. This supplementation can range up to 500–1000 μg in
dosage daily. The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine rec­
ommends a daily dietary intake of 30 mcg/day to maintain health. The aver­
age dietary intake of biotin in the western population is 35–70 mcg/day.
–– Foods rich in biotin include egg yolk, liver, cereals containing wheat and oats,

spinach, mushrooms, rice, breast milk, and dairy items contain biotin.
–– Typically, patients can obtain biotin through diet alone, but if deficiency is

present, oral supplementation has high bioavailability and is given starting at
5 mg/day.

- **Evidence for or against its use:**

–– A recent study in 2017 reviewed 18 reported cases of use of biotin for hair and

nail changes. The overall results show that 10 of the 18 cases had patients with
inherited enzyme deficiencies that utilize biotin as a cofactor. All patients
reported some underlying pathology for poor hair and poor nail growth. All
cases reported clinical improvement of hair and nail growth after receiving
biotin. However, none of the studies included any information regarding effi­


-----

10 C. Trentman et al.

cacy of hair and nail growth in healthy individuals. The author’s conclusion
was that there is no evidence for biotin supplementation outside of known
biotin deficiencies [39].
–– There has not been any reported injuries from taking too much biotin [40].

- **Safety concerns, side effects, and precautions:**

–– Per the FDA in 2017, there was a potential complication of biotin interference

to cause inaccurate laboratory results, including falsely low troponin that
could result in missed or delayed myocardial infarction diagnosis [41].
–– Another study investigated the prevalence of biotin supplementation use in

the general population (surveying the outpatient population) and corresponded
these results with quantifying biotin in plasma samples collected from patients
presenting to the emergency department. These results revealed that among
completed surveys, 7.7% indicated biotin use (of 1944 patients surveyed). Of
the samples collected in the ED ( *n* = 1442), 7.4% had concentrations of biotin
at or above the biotin level in plasma that would qualify for biotin interference
in immunoassay tests. This finding was concerning as this identifies a popula­
tion at risk for potential harm such as falsely low troponins as mentioned
above [42].

- **Interactions with other medications:**

–– Taking anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine or phenobarbital can increase

requirements for biotin due to inhibiting uptake of biotin into brush borders of
membrane vesicles.

–– Smoking and pregnancy can also metabolize biotin quickly, therefore biotin

supplementation may be indicated; however, this is controversial with con­
flicting studies.
–– Biotin can interfere with hormone assays such as thyroid functions, gonado­

trophins, and Vitamin D [43].
###### **Bitter Orange**

- **How it works?**

–– Bitter orange is known by a few different names. The scientific name for the

small citrus tree is *Citrus aurantium* . It is also known by Zhi Shi, Seville
orange, and sour orange. These names refer to the small citrus tree, the peel,
and the fruit. The active ingredients are synephrine and octopamine which are
structurally similar to epinephrine and norepinephrine. These structures are
believed to affect alpha and beta-3 receptors, but affect beta-1 and beta-2
receptors less actively, theorized to have fewer CNS side effects. However,
there are conflicting studies on the mechanism of action of synephrine specifi­
cally. Some studies [44] report the beta-3 activity stimulate the heart and act

in systemic vasodilation, but [45, 46] primarily stimulate alpha-1 adrenergic
receptors due to structural similarity to phenylephrine which would result in
vasoconstriction and increase of blood pressure.

- **What is it used for/dosage?**

–– Weight loss supplement by increasing energy—expenditure.
–– There has been evidence of effective weight loss at a synephrine dose of

32 mg daily, and doses up to 80 mg/day have been used for the treatment of
obesity [47].

- **Evidence for or against its use:**

–– All the current studies investigate bitter orange in combination with other

supplements, such as caffeine, guarana, white willow bark, ginger root extract,
and ma huang. There were no studies found of investigating bitter orange as a
supplement alone.
–– In a study investigating which isomers were present in a weight loss supple­

ment containing bitter orange, the label reported it only contained one isomer
( *m* -synephrine), but the authors’ analysis proved that it contained two types
( *m* -synephrine and *p* -synephrine). *p* -Synephrine is known to cause more CNS
stimulation [48].
–– One of the first clinical studies was a 6-week, double-blind, placebo-­controlled

randomized study involving 23 subjects. This study investigated bitter orange
on weight loss examined a mixture of bitter orange, St. John’s wort, and caf­
feine compared to a control group, placebo group, and an active group. The
results did show that after 6 weeks, there was a statistically significant loss in
body fat and percent fat in the active group compared to control/placebo,
however, no significant differences between groups for body weight, basal

−
metabolic rate, blood pressure, heart rate, or EKG (loss of 2.9% compared
to 0.8%). These results per the authors suggest that bitter orange in combina­
tion with St. John’s wort and caffeine was safe and effective for weight loss in
combination with diet and exercise. However, this study should be interpreted
with caution due to the confounding factors of other supplements involved, as
well as the statistical analysis being performed within the group, it was not
performed between groups [49].
–– Another trial examined the cardiovascular effects involving 15 subjects of a

single dose of bitter orange (6% synephrine). Heart rate and systolic and dia­
stolic heart rate were measured at baseline and every hour for 6 h after
administration.

–– Increase or changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate

were observed for 5 h following administration of bitter orange [50].
–– However, another randomized, open-label, placebo-controlled crossover

design study examined blood pressure and heart rate with synephrine or water
placebo, measuring blood pressure hourly for 5 h, and there was no effect of
blood pressure or pulse [46].

–– Finally, a double-blind, placebo-controlled safety study was conducted in 67

moderately overweight adults (mean BMI of 30.8) and were assigned one of
three treatments, *p* -synephrine, a combination of *p* -synephrine with naringin
and hesperidin, or placebo for 60 days twice a day. There were no differences
among the three groups for lipid profiles, liver enzymes, electrolytes, or CBC,
and no differences in systolic or diastolic blood pressures were observed.
However, the placebo group experienced a significant reduction in heart rate
from baseline compared to the other active treatment groups. There was no
data noted on body weight changes [51].

- **Safety concerns, side effects, and precautions:**

–– Patients with premorbid conditions such as cardiac arrhythmias, hyperthy­

roidism, and narrow angle glaucoma due to the vasoconstriction effect of
synephrine.
–– There has been documentation of a 38-year-old man who suffered an isch­

emic stroke after taking a dietary supplement containing bitter orange for 1
week. No other etiology could be identified as the individual did not suffer
from an atherosclerotic history or have any other comorbidities [52].
–– Another case involves a 52-year-old woman with hypothyroidism (on thyrox­

ine) who had been consuming bitter orange daily (containing 30 mg/daily)
who had developed unremitting tachycardia [53].
–– A 22-year-old male developed rhabdomyolysis after consuming a bitter

orange weight loss formula. He developed fatigue, dehydration, and myalgias
while exercising [54].
–– There has not been enough evidence regarding safety and efficacy to safely

administer to any patient who is pregnant or lactating.

- **Interactions with other medications:**

–– Bitter orange interacts intestinal CYP3A4 and therefore should be avoided in

drugs such as amiodarone, anxiolytics, antidepressants, antiviral medications,
calcium channel blockers, dextromethorphan, prokinetic agents to aide in
digestion, vasoconstricting medications, and other weight loss formula phar­
maceuticals [47].
###### **Blue-Green Algae**

- **How it works?**

–– Blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) are Gram-negative oxygenic photosynthetic

autotrophs that have been used as food in both ancient and present-day civili­
zations in various continents including Asia, Africa, and South America [55].


-----

1 Acarbose–Creatine 13

- **What is it used for and what dosage?**

–– Blue-green algae (most commonly *Chlorella*, *Scenedesmus*, *Spirulina*, and

*Dunaliella)* are mainly marketed as having high nutritive value [55]. Spirulina
is marketed for is protein, γ-linolenic acid (GLA), and phycocyanin con­
tent [56].
–– Researchers and manufacturers also report numerous claims of being a “super

food for super health” with claims of having antiviral, anticancer, antidia­
betic, antibiotic, immune boosting, hypocholesterolemic and weight loss
effects [55].
–– They are also a rich source of vitamins. *S. platensis* has a higher content of

Vitamin B12 and *Spirulina* is rich in provitamin A, Vitamin E, thiamine,
cobalamine, biotin, and inositol [57].
–– The FDA regulates algal products. The status GRAS (generally regarded as

safe) was given to *Spirulina* and *Schizochytrium* . The microcystin content
(discussed below) should not exceed 1 mcg of dry weight for consumption.
–– Spirulina has typically been studied in daily dosage of 1–10 g for 2–12

months; however, there is insufficient clinical data to officially guide dosing

[58–62].

- **Evidence for or against its use:**

–– While cyanobacteria and microalgae are marketed as food supplements with

numerous effects on human health, these claims are all largely based on
in vitro experiments or on experiments involving animal [56].

- **Safety concerns, side effects, and precautions:**

–– The vast majority of cyanotoxin poisoning (cyanobacterial blooms from blue

algae) occur in dogs and livestock [63]
–– A comprehensive literature review dating from 1920s to 2020s demonstrated

that half of the incidences were from a contaminated drinking water supply
and the other half were from recreational exposure [63]. Nowadays, blue-­
green algae are produced in controlled cultivation processes, harvested within
their natural habitats, or in specialized bioreactors [55].
–– Cyanobacteria also produce several potent hepatotoxins and neurotoxins. The

most well-known is microcystin, which is readily taken up by hepatocytes and
cause structural damage. Microcystin is also linked to liver cancer in humans

[64]. The main routes which human health can be affected include ingestion,
inhalation, and skin contact [65].
–– While microcystin is the most encountered and well studied, there is a large

array of other toxins that may be present in these supplements. These include
BMAA (a neurotoxic amino acid) which has been suggested to be associated
with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/parkinsonism dementia complex or ALS/
PDC [55].
–– There is also a large quantity of nucleic acids within algae, which metabolize

to uric acid. This can increase the risk of gout or kidney stones, among other


-----

14 C. Trentman et al.

adverse health effects. However, the current recommended dose of various
blue algae (15 of *Scenedesmus* daily, up to 50 g of Chorella should not pose a
concern to increased uric acid—but cautions away from consuming large
quantities [57].

- **Interactions with other medications:**

–– There have been no well-documented interactions. There has been antiplatelet

effects documented in vitro but not in vivo [66].
###### **Caffeine**

- **How it works?**

–– Caffeine is a central nervous stimulant, found in more than 60 plants such as

coffee beans, tea leaves, cola nuts, and cocoa pods. Caffeine is believed to act
in three ways. First, it acts as a central nervous stimulation via an adenosine
blockade which in turn releases neurotransmitters such as dopamine, cate­
cholamines, and acetylcholine. The second mechanism is via enhancement of
muscle contraction via improved calcium output from the sarcoplasmic retic­
ulum to the sarcoplasm after a muscle action potential. Finally, it acts by
inhibiting phosphodiesterases which in turn inhibits the degradation of cAMP
and stimulates lipolysis, causing the activity of hormone-sensitive lipase
which plays a vital role in the adrenaline cascade.

- **What is it used for?**

–– There is a consensus regarding the effects of caffeine consumption on aerobic

performance with high doses, there has been pronounced effects on physio­
logical responses to exercise, including increased heart rates, doubling of cat­
echolamine levels, higher blood lactate levels, and increased blood-free fatty
acids. These effects have also been studied at medium and lower doses, and

recent work shows that lower caffeine doses taken before exercise can also

increase athletic performance, improved vigilance, alertness and mood, and
cognitive processes during and following strenuous exercise [67].

- **Evidence for or against its use:**

–– A recent meta-analysis conducted in 2020 examined the effects of caffeine

ingestion on exercise performance. This meta-analysis contained 11 reviews
and showed that caffeine ingestion improves exercises on a broad range of
exercise tasks. It also demonstrated ergogenic effects on muscle endurance,
muscle strength, anaerobic power, and aerobic endurance [68].
–– Another study examined the effects of supplement identification on exercise

performance with caffeine supplementation. Caffeine improved performance
over the control group or placebo group [69].

–– Another randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover designed

study investigated the effects of caffeine supplementation on anerobic perfor­
mance, neuromuscular efficiency, and upper and lower limb extremity fatigue
in Olympic level boxers. The resulting conclusion showed that caffeine sup­
plementation improved anaerobic performance without affecting EMG activ­
ity and fatigue levels in the lower limbs [70].

- **Safety concerns, side effects, and precautions:**

–– The ingestion of high doses can produce gastrointestinal upset, nervousness,

mental confusion, inability to focus, and disturbing sleeping in some sub­
jects [67].
–– In many lethal cases, caffeine had been introduced as a dietary supplement in

conjunction with other substances such as stimulant drugs and alcohol. The
acute toxic level of caffeine isn’t well established, but for adults is approxi­
mately 10 g of caffeine a day, which would be equivalent to approximately
100 cups of coffee [71].

- **Interactions with other medications:**

–– The enzyme P450 1A2 participates in the metabolism of caffeine. There are

several medications that inhibit this enzyme, including the selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine, the antiarrhythmic mexiletine, the antipsy­
chotic clozapine, psoralens, idrocilamide and phenylpropanolamine, bron­
chodilators furafylline and theophylline, and the quinolone enoxacin. Due to
these drugs acting as potent inhibitors of this enzyme, this could lead to toxic
effects of caffeine, especially if concomitantly being taken with other drugs
that are metabolized by this same enzyme [72].
###### **Calcium**

- **How it works?**

–– Calcium is the most plentiful mineral in the human body, found mainly in

bones and teeth. It is also found in blood, muscles, and other tissues with a
variety of functions within the body. Physical activity such as weight-bearing
exercises, loss of calcium via sweat, and the female athlete triad (disordered
eating, amenorrhea, and osteoporosis) are all important factors to consider for
supplementation as it relates to physical activity [73].

- **What is it used for?**

–– Calcium is involved in a myriad of processes within the human body. While

its most well-known function for bone health and prevention of osteoporosis,
it is utilized for many other functions within the human body that would be of
interest to an athlete. It is involved in muscle contraction, regulation of


-----

16 C. Trentman et al.

­heartbeat, nerve impulse conduction, blood pressure, and balance of water
within the body, energy and fat metabolism, and general transport of nutrients
across cell membranes [73].

- **Evidence for or against its use:**

–– A large placebo-controlled study involving 33,000 women administered

1000 mg calcium carbonate and 400 mg Vitamin D3 compared to placebo
examining physical performance and exercise measures after 1, 2, and 4
years. The results showed no improvement in subjective or objective physical
function [74].
–– Another study found elevated urinary calcium losses after a high impact train­

ing program, suggesting that calcium is utilized in higher amounts in high
impact physical exercise. However, the current literature reviewed did not
conclude the need for calcium supplementation greater than what can be
obtained via diet [75].

- **Safety concerns, side effects, and precautions:**

–– In a study reviewing randomized control trial evidence of adverse events from

calcium supplementation, gastrointestinal events were the most common
described. This included constipation, abdominal cramping, bloating, upper
GI events, GI disease, and severe diarrhea (for calcium there was an incidence
of 14.1%, for placebo 10.0%, with a relative risk (RR) of 1.43, and a confi­
dence interval of 1.28–1.59, *p* < 0.001) [76].
–– Two trials also examined self-reported myocardial infarctions with dietary

calcium supplementation at 3.6% rate in the calcium supplementation group
and 2.1% in the placebo group. However, after undergoing an adjudication
process by the reviewers, the adjusted rates were 2.4% in the calcium group
and 1.6% in the placebo group [76].

- **Interactions with other medications:**

–– An absolute contraindication to being prescribed calcium carbonate is con­

comitant use of ceftriaxone due to increased risk of end-organ failure and
death [77].
###### **Catechin**

- **How it works?**

–– Green tea extract contains catechins (CA), which are polyphenolic com­

pounds, the major being epicatechin, epigallocatechin, epicatechin-3-gallate,
and epigallocatechin-3-gallate [78]. These fall within the family of flavonoids,
and are thought to have antioxidative potential, but these studies have often
only been demonstrated in vitro studies [79].


-----

1 Acarbose–Creatine


17


–– It is also proposed that catechins upregulate lipid-metabolizing enzymes via

the NF-κB activation by inhibiting the peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptors (PPARs) that are important transcription factors for lipid metabo­
lism, and in theory mRNA expression of lipid-metabolizing enzymes would
be upregulated [80].

- **What is it used for?**

–– Catechin is a frequent ingredient in herbal and dietary supplements, typically

labeled as green tea extract. It is typically marketed as an antioxidant and a
weight loss supplement [78].

- **Evidence for or against its use:**

–– The European food safety authority had a safety meeting regarding the safety

of consuming green tea catechins. The conclusion was that green tea infu­
sions, prepared in a traditional way, are in general safe for consumption; how­
ever, there is evidence from interventional clinical trials that doses equal or
above 800 mg a day can induce a statistically significant increase of serum
transaminases [81].
–– One study evaluated the influence of green tea catechin beverage on body

composition and fat distribution in overweight and obese adults during
exercised-­induced weight loss. 107 participants were assigned to receive a
beverage containing ~625 mg of catechins with 39 mg of caffeine or a control
beverage for 12 weeks and participate in similar amounts of moderate inten­
sity exercise.
–– Percentage changes in fat mass did not differ between the catechin group

compared to the control group, but percentage changes in total abdominal fat
area and fasting serum triglycerides were greater in the catechin group. These
findings suggest that the consumption of a beverage containing green tea cat­
echins (625 mg/day) may enhance exercise-induced loss of abdominal fat and
improve circulating free fatty acids and triglyceride levels [82].
–– However, a meta-analysis of six studies on 532 participants produced a very

small, statistically non-significant mean difference in weight loss [83].

- **Safety concerns, side effects, and precautions:**

–– Catechins were implicated in several case reports regarding hepatoxicity. A

further investigative report assayed herbal dietary supplements that were
implicated in human hepatotoxicity and screened for catechins. The results
were that many of these supplements may commonly contain catechins even
if their presence is not listed on the drug label, but there was no statistically
significant association between presence of catechin or the dose consumed in
liver or causality score, severity, or pattern of liver injury [78].
–– Additionally, the US Pharmacopeia conducted a systematic review to deter­

mine the safety of green tea extracts with the conclusion that these extracts
can contain hepatotoxic solvent residues, pesticide residues, pyrrolizidine
alkaloids, and elemental impurities, but no evidence of involvement in actual

C. Trentman et al.

green tea extract induced injury. Therefore, the official conclusion from this
review was to include a cautionary label that recommends not to use if patients
have any pre-existing liver problem [84].

###### **Chitosan**

- **What is it?**

–– Chitosan is a natural polysaccharide derived from chitin which is a widely

used biopolymer [85]. They are a large component of arthropod shells such as
crabs, shrimps, and insects, and are also produced extracellularly by various
fungi and algae [86].

- **How does it work in the body?**

–– Studies have shown that Chitosan taken as a food supplement forms a gel in the

intestinal tract which binds dietary lipids and other nutrients, resulting in a
reduction in intestinal lipid absorption as well as other vitamins and minerals,
this in turn causes lower serum cholesterol and triglycerides [86]. Chitosan
also displays hormonal and protein-modulating properties such as increasing
serum leptin concentration and leading to a reduction in C-reactive protein [87].

- **What is it used for?**

–– Chitosan is used as a weight loss and anti-obesity supplement. A 2019 meta-­

analysis showed that Chitosan supplementation led to a clinically significant
reduction in body weight, BMI, and body fat [88]. Chitosan supplementation
is also used as a cholesterol-lowering agent [86]. There have also been reports
of its use for treating hypertension, wound healing, and for antimicrobial pur­
poses [85, 86]. Notably, further studies in human participants are needed to
solidify the evidence to support these claims.

- **Evidence for and against:**

–– A 2018 meta-analysis showed that Chitosan supplementation can lead to min­

imal weight loss and an improvement in serum lipid and cardiovascular fac­
tors [85].
–– In animal studies, short-term chitosan administration was shown to cause a

reduction in the absorption of vitamins and minerals including fat-soluble
vitamins, calcium, and Vitamin E. This led to a reduction in bone mineral
content and growth restriction [86].

- **Precautions/side effects:**

–– Adverse effects of Chitosan include a reduction in Vitamin E levels in plasma,

reduction in bone mineral content, growth retardation, and reduced absorp­
tion of fat-soluble vitamins and minerals [86]. These may lead to symptoms


-----

19


such as weakness, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, increased bone fragility, and
steatorrhea.

- **Dosage:**

–– A meta-analysis which included 14 studies showed a mean dosage of 2 g/day

p.o [85].

- **Interactions:**

–– Chitosan has been shown to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin if

used together, likely due to reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, namely
Vitamin K [89].
–– Individuals with shellfish allergies should avoid chitosan [90].
###### **Chlorogenic Acid**

- **What is it?**

–– Chlorogenic acid is a polyphenol compound that is sourced from coffee beans

as well as various fruits and vegetables [91].

- **How does it work in the body?**

–– A 2017 systematic review showed that chlorogenic acids counteract oxidative

stress by scavenging free radicals, acting as a metal chelator, reducing lipid
peroxidation, and inhibiting NADPH oxidase activity. It also inhibits alpha
glucosidase which limits digestive uptake of carbohydrates. This leads to a
combination of antidiabetic, anti-carcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-­
bacterial effects [91, 92].

- **What is it used for?**

–– Chlorogenic acids are mainly used for weight loss and to lower blood pres­

sure, but studies have shown that it may also be beneficial as an anti-bacterial
agent, as a blood sugar-lowering agent, and to improve mood [91].

- **Evidence for and against:**

–– A 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis found that chlorogenic acid sup­

plementation led to statistically significant reductions in systolic and diastolic
blood pressure although they mention that further studies should be con­
ducted. Of the five studies included, no adverse events were reported follow­
ing chlorogenic acid intake [93].
–– A 2017 article found that chlorogenic acid may have a role in the treatment of

metabolic syndrome through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antilipid­
emic properties. They suggest that this supplement may also have anti-­
microbial properties, making it a useful nutritional supplement [94].


-----

20 C. Trentman et al.

- **Dosage:**

–– There is no official dose of CGA supplementation, but user dosing typically

ranges anywhere from 240 to 3000 mg/day.

- **Precautions/side effects:**

–– Individuals with green coffee bean extract allergies may have an adverse reac­

tion to this supplement in the form of an asthmatic response, studies suggest
that this is likely due to the surrounding compounds in the coffee beans rather
than chlorogenic acid itself [95].

- **Interactions:**

–– Chlorogenic acids may elicit adverse interactions with antihypertensives

since it has blood pressure lowering effects as well. Chlorogenic acids may
also be shown to enhance the effects of metformin in lowering blood sugar.
This can cause episodes of hypotension and hypoglycemia, respectively, so
precautions should be taken [96].
###### **Chromium**

- **What is it?**

–– Chromium is a trivalent trace element and essential nutrient that is commonly

found in many foods and used as a nutritional supplement in humans and
animals [97].

- **How does it work in the body?**

–– In the body, 95% of chromium is bound to proteins such as transferrin, the

remainder is unbound and can accumulate in the liver, bone, soft tissue, and
spleen. Chromium may enhance insulin activity, leading to increased metabo­
lism of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. The exact mechanism is still
unclear, but studies suggest that this may occur through chromium binding to
chromodulin, a substance that can directly bind to insulin receptors and
enhance its activity. Chromium is excreted in the urine [98].

- **What is it used for?**

–– Studies have shown that chromium deficiency can cause a diabetic-like state

with features such as elevated blood sugars, impaired growth, elevated serum
lipids, decreased fertility, and nerve damage. Chromium supplementation is
used to treat and prevent chromium deficiency which is usually only seen in
severely malnourished individuals or patients undergoing total parenteral
nutrition without added chromium [99, 100]. Supplementation with chro­
mium is also used for prevention and control of diabetes and hyperlipidemia
as studies suggest improved glycemic and lipid profiles with its use [100,


-----

21


101]. There have been claims that chromium supplementation can also aid in
weight loss, cognitive function, and bone health but there is insufficient evi­
dence to support these claims at this time.

- **Evidence** **for and against:**

–– Chromium has been shown to improve blood glucose and related variables in

diabetes mellitus type 1 and 2, gestational diabetes, and corticosteroid-­
induced diabetes [100].
–– A 2014 meta-analysis showed that chromium mono and combined supple­

mentation significantly reduced HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG)
levels. It also showed that chromium mono-supplementation elevated HDL-c
levels and lowered triglycerides. These effects were most notably enhanced
with the combination of chromium-picolinate [101].
–– A 2016 meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials showed that chro­

−
mium significantly reduced FPG levels by an average of 29.26 mg/dL and
significantly lowered total cholesterol at an average of −6.7 mg/dL [102].
–– A 2015 meta-analysis with 875 participants showed that chromium yeast and

chromium-picolinate did not show significant effects on HbA1c or FPG [103].

- **Dosage:**

–– Dietary reference intake suggests an adequate intake of 35 and 25 mcg,

respectively, in men and women aged 19–50 (30 and 20 mcg, respectively, in
men and women aged 51 or older) [98]. A 2014 systematic review suggests
that >200 mcg of chromium mono-supplementation may improve glycemic
control [101]. Doses typically should not exceed 1000 mcg daily [104].

- **Precautions/side effects:**

–– Chromium supplementation is typically safe with mild adverse effects

reported in the form of headaches, sleep disturbances, and irritabil­
ity [101, 102, 104].

- **Interactions:**

–– Chromium may interact with insulin, metformin, or other blood-glucose-­

lowering antidiabetic medications to cause hypoglycemia so simultaneous
use should be discussed with a health care provider. Chromium may also
reduce levothyroxine absorption [98].
###### **Coenzyme Q10**

- **What is it?**

–– Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a naturally occurring quinone that is found in

many aerobic organisms such as bacteria and mammals. It functions primarily


-----

22 C. Trentman et al.

to aid in energy production, augment the immune system, and combat
­oxidative damage in the body. It is found in abundance in tissues with signifi­
cant metabolic activity such as the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen, pan­
creas, and adrenal glands. It is typically sourced through oily fish such as tuna
and salmon, organ meats, and whole grains; however, it can also be supple­
mented in the form of oral tablets, capsules, and sprays [105].

- **How does it work in the body?**

–– In mitochondria, CoQ10 functions primarily as a cofactor in the electron

transport chain during the formation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for cel­
lular energy [105]. It is also found on cell membranes and transport lipopro­
teins such as LDL and HDL where it functions as an antioxidant to combat

oxidative damage [106]. CoQ10 exists in the body in two forms: Ubiquinone
(oxidized form) or Ubiquinol (reduced form). Most of its antioxidant proper­
ties are carried out in its Ubiquinol form, and it does so by neutralizing free
radicals and reactive oxygen species [105, 107].

- **What is it used for?**

–– Supplementation with CoQ10 is typically used to improve its deficiency as

well as diseases related to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress
such as fibromyalgia, diabetes, chronic fatigue syndrome, and heart diseases.
It can also be used for performance enhancement and to prevent adverse
effects of statins [108, 109].

- **Evidence for and against:**

–– *CoQ10 deficiency* : Deficiency can lead to symptoms such as weakness,

fatigue, seizures, encephalopathy, and nephrotic syndrome. Oral CoQ10 sup­
plementation has been shown to reduce these symptoms and reverse the pro­
gression of some [110].
–– *Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy (MELAS)* : Studies show that CoQ10 sup­

plementation can improve symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction such as
nerve dysfunction, muscle weakness, tremors, cramps, and muscle stiff­
ness [111, 112].
–– *Heart disease* : Studies show that CoQ10 supplementation has significant ben­

efits for heart health. CoQ10 was shown to reduce heart wall thickness, regu­
late heart rate, improve heart function, and quality of life in patients with
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [113]. In heart failure studies inclusive of 420
and 639 participants, oral CoQ10 supplementation was shown to reduce mor­
tality, hospitalizations, and significant complications from heart failure

[114, 115]. Another study also found that supplementation reduced heart fail­
ure mortality but that it did not improve heart function or symptoms [116].
–– *Vascular health* : CoQ10 was shown to increase nitric oxide levels through its

antioxidant effects leading to improved blood vessel dilation and increased
circulation [117, 118].


-----

23


–– *Blood pressure* : Many studies inclusive of over 280 participants show that

CoQ10 supplementation reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure

[119, 120]. Other studies suggest that supplementation with 200 mg/day for
12 weeks had no effect on blood pressure [118].
–– *Inflammation* : A systematic review found that CoQ10 supplementation sig­

nificantly reduced inflammatory markers such as TNF-α but had no effect on
CRP and IL-6 [121].
–– *Diabetes mellitus* : 400 mg of CoQ10 daily was shown to reduce nerve dam­

age and improved nerve function in diabetic mice. CoQ10 also has been
shown to protect organs such as the kidneys and heart from elevated blood
sugar levels [122, 123]. A meta-analysis also showed that low doses of CoQ10
(<200 mg) reduced blood sugar levels when given for 12 weeks or less [124].
–– *Migraines* : CoQ10 supplementation has been shown to reduce migraine dura­

tion, frequency, and severity [125].
–– *Fibromyalgia* : Patients with fibromyalgia have been shown to have reduced

and dysfunctional CoQ10, supplementation has been shown to improve head­
ache, depression, and fatigue symptoms associated with this disorder [126].
–– *Multiple sclerosis* : 500 mg/day of CoQ10 has been shown to improve fatigue

and depression associated with multiple sclerosis [127].

- **Dosage:**

–– 100–300 mg of CoQ10 twice daily has proven to be effective for most of its

usages. It has been shown to be safe and well tolerated at dosages up to
1200 mg daily [128].

- **Precautions/side effects:**

–– Studies show that CoQ10 does not cause serious harmful effects in humans,

but mild side effects may include diarrhea, nausea, loss of appetite, headache,
or rash. It is metabolized by the liver and eliminated through bile so people
with liver or biliary pathology may be at a higher risk of experiencing these
side effects due to poor elimination from the body [129].

- **Interactions:**

–– *Warfarin* : CoQ10 has structural similarity to procoagulant Vitamin K so may

reduce Warfarin’s effect [130].
–– *Blood pressure* : CoQ10 has been shown to lower blood pressure so should be

taken with caution by those taking antihypertensives [119].
–– *Blood sugar* : CoQ10 has been shown to lower blood-glucose levels so should

be taken with caution by those taking glucose-lowering medications [124].

###### **Colostrum**

- **What is it?**


C. Trentman et al.


–– Colostrum is a milk that is secreted by mammals in the initial post-partum

period that contains nutrients such as carbohydrates, growth factors, proteins,
enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, antibodies, nucleotides and nucleosides, cyto­
kines, fats, vitamins, and minerals [131]. Colostrum is produced during the
first week following birth and provides significant protection for newborns
with developing immune systems, it eventually transitions into mature
milk [132].

- **How does it work in the body?**

–– Colostrum has a wide range of mechanisms in the body. These include boost­

ing immunity by activating natural killer cells and stimulating IFN-gamma
and IL-2 release [133]. Suppressing myeloperoxidase activity to reduce oxi­
dative damage [134]. It protects the gastrointestinal system through its anti-­
inflammatory and antimicrobial properties [135]. It can also raise IGF-1 levels
allowing for better glucose utilization and storage [136].

- **What is it used for?**

–– Colostrum supplementation is frequently used for modulating immune

defense, aiding in gastrointestinal issues such as diarrhea and leaky gut, stim­
ulating exercise enhancement, and aiding in Alzheimer’s disease and memory
loss [135].

- **Evidence for and against:**

–– *Diarrhea* *and* *respiratory infections* : A study of 160 children showed that

bovine colostrum significantly reduced the number of upper respiratory tract
infections, diarrheal episodes, and number of hospital admissions. Another
study with 605 children showed similar results [137, 138]. In a study of 74
people, there were fewer reports of respiratory tract infections reported when
taking colostrum [139].
–– *Immune* : In a study of 18 participants Colostrum was shown to enhance IgA

antibodies and increase mucosal protection [140]. Another study with 198
participants showed that consumption of colostrum had no effect on immuno­
logical parameters [141]. In mice, colostrum was shown to enhance natural
killer cell activity [142]. In a study of 35 long distance runners, Colostrum
supplementation was shown to increase IgA levels [143]. A study found that
Colostrum supplementation was more effective than vaccination for prevent­
ing influenza in both healthy and high-risk cardiovascular subjects.
–– *Muscle enhancement* : One study showed significantly increased lean body

weight when taking Colostrum supplementation compared to whey protein.
Another study showed that both whey protein and colostrum equally increased
lean body mass, total body mass, and strength [144].

–– *Alzheimer’s and memory loss* : Studies have shown that long-term colostrinin,

which is a component of colostrum, may slow memory loss and cognitive
deficits associated with Alzheimer’s disease [145].

- **Dosage:**

–– Doses varied from as low as 500 mg/day for leaky gut to as high as 60 g/day

for upper respiratory tract infections [139, 146].

- **Precautions/side effects:**

–– Colostrum is generally a safe supplement and tolerated well. Mild side effects

include nausea, gas, skin rash, diarrhea, and stomach pain [135].

- **Interactions:**

–– Colostrum may alter the effectiveness of NSAIDs due to its lactoferrin con­

tent which can bind NSAIDs [147].
###### **Conjugated Linoleic Acid**

- **What is it?**

–– Conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) are poly-unsaturated fatty acids with various

bonding structures within them. They are found mainly in meat and dairy
products but can also be used as supplements [148, 149].

- **How does it work in the body?**

–– CLAs contain cis, trans, and double bonds. In foods like meat and dairy, they

are found in the CLA cis-9, trans-11 form but in supplements they are found
in the trans-10, cis-12 form [148].

- **What is it used for?**

–– Supplemental CLA are primarily used as anti-obesity and anti-hypertensive

agents regularly [148–150].

- **Evidence for and against:**

–– *Blood pressure* : One study that included 80 obese individuals showed that

CLA supplementation significantly enhanced the effect of Ramipril on sys­
tolic and diastolic blood pressure reduction [151].
–– *Cholesterol* : In a study of 61 healthy women, high intake of supplemental

CLA was shown to significantly elevate HDL levels [152].
–– *Heart disease* : Cardiomyocyte exposure to high glucose levels can result in

structural and functional damage to the heart, one study in rat cells found that
cells pre-treated with CLA can prevent this cardiomyocyte damage in the set­
ting of hyperglycemia [153].

26 C. Trentman et al.

–– *Obesity* : CLA supplementation was shown to significantly improve weight

loss in a 63-subject study over a 12-week period, this led to reduced body
weight, BMI, total fat mass, and a reduced fat percentage. Subjects’ waist to
hip ratio and subcutaneous fat mass also significantly decreased [154]. Some
studies have not shown any relationship between CLA and weight loss [155].
–– *Fatty liver disease* : Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) can be seen in

obese patients and lead to liver failure. A study consisting of 38 obese indi­
viduals showed that CLA supplementation improved insulin resistance, lipid
disturbances, oxidative stress, and liver function in NAFLD [156].
–– *Cancer* : There have been claims that CLA can be beneficial against certain

types of cancer but further studies on human subjects need to be conducted to
further explore the role of CLA in cancer treatment and prevention.

- **Dosage:**

–– There is no standardized dosing for CLA as an adequately powered study to

address this has not yet been conducted. For many of its usages that were
explored, 5 g/day of CLA was shown to be safe and effective.

- **Precautions/side effects:**

–– Side effects of CLA are normally mild and include excessive flatulence, bloat­

ing, nausea, and diarrhea [148].
–– Men with metabolic syndrome that were taking supplemental CLA had

increased insulin resistance and oxidative stress which led to increased inflam­
mation and diabetes [157].
–– Animal studies which showed adverse effects with supplemental CLA

include:

Kidney damage and enlargement in obese rats with pre-existing kidney
disease that were given CLA [158].
Supplemental CLA in large doses was shown to lead to fat accumulation in
the liver of rodents [159].

- **Interactions:**

–– There are no known interactions for CLA.
###### **Copper**

- **What is it?**

–– Copper is an essential trace element in the human body. It is required for

growth, bone strength, immune function, heart function, brain development,
cholesterol and glucose metabolism. Its daily requirement is typically met by
the North American standard diet [160].


-----

1 Acarbose–Creatine 27

- **How does it work in the body?**

–– Copper is a cofactor for a group of enzymes called cuproenzymes which

includes cytochrome c oxidase, lysyl oxidase, ferroxidase, dopamine
β-hydroxylase, superoxide dismutase, ceruloplasmin, and tyrosinase

[161, 162].

- **What is it used for?**

–– Copper supplementation is used for copper deficiency, skin health, bone loss,

heart health, immune function, and anxiety and depression [160].

- **Evidence for and against:**

–– *Copper deficiency* : Copper deficiency can present as anemia, heart disease,

neutropenia, myelopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and myelodysplasia-like
effects. Deficiency is typically only seen when on parenteral nutrition [163].
Copper supplementation in the setting of deficiency has been shown to stimu­
late bone formation and reduce bone abnormalities in infants and elderly. It
was also shown to improve heart function in deficient individuals [164–166].
–– *Skin* : Copper supplementation has been shown to increase collagen and elas­

tin production for strength and elasticity of skin, respectively. Copper also
showed antimicrobial properties in the setting of athlete’s foot in a study con­
sisting of 56 subjects. Copper prevented skin infections and ulcer wounds in
long-standing diabetics [167–169].
–– *Bone loss* : Through its action as a cofactor for various enzymes, Copper has a

vital role in the formation of bone [160]. In a study consisting of 73 women,
Copper was shown to significantly reduce the loss of vertebral trabecular bone
mineral density over the course of 2 years [170].
–– There have been further studies that suggest Copper supplementation may

have a role in heart health, immune function, and anxiety and depression but
larger clinical studies involving humans would need to be conducted to sup­
port these claims.

- **Dosage:**

–– The recommended daily copper intake for children: 0.3–0.9 mg/day, adults:

0.9 mg/day, and pregnant or breastfeeding mothers: 1–1.3 mg/day. The safe
upper limit for copper supplementation is 10 mg/day [171].

- **Precautions/side effects:**

–– *Copper toxicity* : Copper toxicity is normally seen with ingestion of more than

1 g of copper, and it can lead to erosive gastropathy, intravascular hemolysis,
methemoglobinemia, hepatitis, acute kidney injury, and rhabdomyolysis

[172]. Chronic copper toxicity is typically seen in those with inherited disor­
ders of copper metabolism such as Wilson’s disease or idiopathic copper toxi­
cosis, supplementation should not be used in these individuals. Chronically
elevated copper levels may be linked to oxidative damage, Alzheimer’s dis­
ease, Parkinson’s disease, and diabetes [173–176].

–– *Increased absorption* : Things shown to increase copper absorption include

high protein diet and amino acids glycine, l-tryptophan, and l-methionine

[177, 178].
–– *Decreased absorption* : Copper absorption has been shown to be reduced with

amino acids l-histidine and l-cystine, zinc, iron, carbohydrates, and dietary
fiber [178–180].
###### **Creatine**

- **What is it?**

–– Creatine is a natural substance derived from amino acids that is stored in

muscles and released upon physical activity. It is widely used to elevate exer­
cise performance and strengthen muscles and is naturally found in sources
such as meat and fish [181, 182].

- **How does it work in the body?**

–– Creatine is mainly stored in the skeletal muscle as phosphocreatine, the

remainder of the body’s creatine is stored in the brain, kidney, and liver. The
phosphocreatine stored in muscle has high-energy phosphate groups attached
to it which allow it to release energy and significantly enhance the formation
of new ATP molecules. This allows for a high-energy burst lasting only a short
duration (5–10 s) until a drop in phosphocreatine levels occurs. Supplementation
with creatine bolsters strength and performance by regenerating ATP that gets
used during exercise as well as regenerating phosphocreatine supplies follow­
ing exercise during recovery [181, 182].

- **What is it used for?**

–– Creatine is one of the most popular supplements in the world and is mainly

used for exercise performance and muscle strength, preventing muscle dam­
age and fatigue, protecting against age-related muscle loss, and enhancing
cognitive function [182].

- **Evidence for and against:**

–– *Exercise performance* *and* *muscle strength* : Creatine supplementation bol­

sters phosphocreatine stores which increase ATP energy utilization, especially
in muscles during short high intensity workouts [181, 182]. In a meta-analysis
of 22 studies, creatine supplementation during resistance training was found
to significantly increase muscle strength by 8%, weightlifting performance by
14%, and 1 rep max bench press by a high of 45% when compared with just
resistance training alone [183]. Another meta-analysis of 100 studies found
that creatine supplementation significantly increased lean body mass when

doing short-term, repetitive exercises, this same study also found that creatine
did not improve endurance-based exercise such as running or swimming,
which is consistent with other studies [184]. In a study of 32 healthy men
undergoing heavy resistance training, creatine supplementation (6–24 g/day)
significantly increased muscle growth better than daily protein (20 g/day)

[185]. Creatine was also shown to lower mystatin-induced muscle growth
impairment [186].
–– *Muscle damage and fatigue* : Creatine has been shown to protect against mus­

cle damage and fatigue and aid in its recovery. One study inclusive of 14 men
showed that creatine supplementation significantly increased isokinetic and
isometric knee-extension strength during recovery from exercise-induced
muscle damage, plasma creatine kinase which is a marker of myocyte damage
was also lower [187]. Another study on 22 men showed that oral creatinine
supplementation did not lower skeletal muscle damage or aid in muscle recov­
ery after a hypoxic resistance exercise challenge [188].
–– *Age-related muscle loss* : Studies suggest that creatine supplementation can

protect against age-related muscle loss. In a study on elderly individuals, cre­
atine supplementation was shown to reduce muscle atrophy, increase muscle
strength and endurance, and increase bone strength even in the absence of
resistance training [189].
–– *Cognitive function* : Studies suggest that creatine may have a role in prevent­

ing mental fatigue and improving cognitive function. One study found that in
sleep-deprived athletes, creatine supplementation improved cognitive skills
after 1 week of supplementation. Another study showed that creatine supple­
mentation improved complex cognitive skills, it was taken along with moder­
ate intensity exercise for 1 week prior to sleep deprivation [190, 191]. In
another study, creatine supplementation was shown to improve cognitive per­
formance and quality of life in elderly individuals after only 2 weeks [192].
–– There have been further studies that suggest that creatine supplementation

may play a role in elevating testosterone levels, stabilizing musculoskeletal
manifestations of Parkinson’s disease, improving heart health, lowering blood
glucose levels, and increasing bone health. Further clinical studies with
human participants should be conducted to explore these claims in more depth.

- **Dosage:**

–– Creatine dosing typically occurred in phases. The first phase was the loading

phase in which patients received a larger amount in about 20 g/day for the first
5–7 days. The second phase was the maintenance phase in which the dose
would reduce to 3–5 g/day. This was done to adequately bring creatine levels
to an effective concentration [193].

- **Precautions/side** **effects:**

–– Creatine is likely safe in doses below 30 g/day. Side effects typically include

stomach pain and cramping. This supplement can also lead to water retention
and weight gain [194]. Creatine has not been shown to damage the kidneys in
the short or long term [193].

–– *Fenugreek* : Creatine has been shown to maximize strength and training adap­

tation when taken in conjunction with fenugreek [195].
–– *Coenzyme Q10* : Creatine paired with CoQ10 was shown to delay cognitive

decline in subjects with mild cognitive impairment and Parkinson’s dis­
ease [196].

###### **Dandelion**

- **Other names:** *Taraxacum officinale*, lion’s tooth, blowball.

- **Mechanism of action:**

–– The components of the dandelion plant (flower, leaves, stems, and root) con­

tain various chemical compounds which have been studied for their medicinal
properties. These include anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, and anti-­
carcinogenic properties.
–– These compounds include: taraxasterol, chicoric acid (CRA), and chlorogenic

acid (CGA).

- **Common indications/uses:**

–– Dandelion leaves and flowers are commonly used as a salad green and to

make wine and teas. The root can be roasted and used as a coffee substitute.

Some of the earlier mentioned chemical compounds have been studied for
their anti-hyperglycemic and anti-inflammatory benefits.

- **Dosing:**

–– Dandelion root supplements may be found in doses between 500 and 2000 mg.

- **Evidence:**

–– Chicoric acid is found in high concentrations in all parts of the dandelion

plant and has been studied for its anti-hyperglycemic effects. It has been

shown to improve glucose tolerance and reduce insulin resistance in diabetic
mice. Furthermore, chicoric acid can prevent the endothelial damage caused
by hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress via its antioxidant properties. Ma
et al. found this to be related to activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase
signaling pathway.
–– Taraxasterol and taraxerol have been isolated in the natural root extract of

*Taraxacum officinale* during chemical analysis *.* Taraxasterol has anti-­
inflammatory properties, and there is some interest in studying its potential
for anti-carcinogenic activity.

- **Safety concerns:**

–– *Adverse reactions* : Allergic reaction.

- **Drug interactions:**

–– May interact with lithium and quinolone antibiotics.
###### **Fennel**

- **Other names:** *Foeniculum vulgare* .

- **Mechanism of action:**

–– Fennel is a good source of vitamin C, potassium, plant flavanoids, and beta-­

carotene which. Vitamin C and flavanoids (discussed further in their own sec­
tion) have antioxidant activity which in turn are anti-inflammatory. Other
compounds found in fennel seeds—including anethole and estragole—are
thought to make it a possible galactogogue. For this reason, fennel seeds/fen­
nel seed oils are included in some lactation supplements, but there have not
been large randomized trials to prove its efficacy.
–– One randomized trial testing the effects of curcumin and fennel essential oil

on IBS symptoms also had positive results. This study is discussed further in
the evidence section.

- **Common indications/uses:**

–– Fennel and fennel seeds are commonly used in a normal diet. As noted above,

the oils of fennel seeds have compounds which are thought to be beneficial to
lactation.

- **Dosing:**

–– 50 mg fennel essential oil was used in Portincasa et al., but fennel is otherwise

used unmeasured in its vegetable form which is not concentrated.

- **Evidence:**

–– Portincasa et al. studied the combination of curcumin and fennel in patients

with IBS. Curcumin has anti-inflammatory properties, and fennel has anti­

spasmodic and anti-inflammatory effects which the authors wanted to assess
together for improvement of IBS symptoms. Over 30 days, patients in the
experimental group reported improvement in their IBS symptoms and better
quality of life.

- **Safety concerns:**

–– *Adverse reactions* : Allergic reactions, photosensitivity.

- **Drug interactions:**

–– Ciprofloxacin absorption, distribution, and elimination were affected by fen­

nel ingestion in a small randomized study.
###### **Fenugreek**

- **Other names:** *Trigonella foenum-graecum.*

- **Mechanism of action:**

–– The seeds of fenugreek are a source of multiple chemical compounds and

have been used historically in foods and drinks. They have been used around
the world as a possible galactogogue and are thought to increase insulin and
oxytocin secretion; however, there is no definitive evidence for its effects in
humans and because of history of birth defects, may not be safe for use during
lactation.

–– Fenugreek is also thought to have anti-hyperglycemic properties.

- **Common indications/uses:**

–– Fenugreek is an herb-like plant which is used in foods and drinks in its leaf

form and seed form. The seeds have also been used historically as a medicine
thought to aid with lactation.

- **Dosing:**

–– In one randomized controlled clinical trial by Najdi et al., patients were given

2 g of fenugreek daily spread out over three doses as suggested by the GNC
company. However, fenugreek is widely used as a seasoning and herb in
unmeasured smaller amounts.

- **Evidence:**

–– In a small randomized controlled study by Najdi et al., the effect of fenugreek

supplementation versus glibenclamide supplementation was studied in 12
type 2 diabetic patients over a 12-week period. This study resulted in a signifi­
cantly increased fasting insulin level and HDL/LDL ratio in the fenugreek
group. Fasting blood glucose was not significantly different between the
groups. These results are similar to other studies of fenugreek effects on fast­

ing blood glucose, insulin, and lipid profiles and suggest some benefits of
fenugreek use in patients with diabetes and otherwise affected by metabolic
syndrome. These anti-hyperglycemic benefits do still require confirmation by
larger randomized controlled studies.
–– In a systematic review, fenugreek was compared with other substances to

determine its effectiveness as a galactogogue. In their pairwise comparisons
of fenugreek to placebo, control, and other galactogogues, fenugreek did sig­
nificantly increase breast milk production but was not better than other galac­
togogues including *Coleus amboinicus* and palm date. They concluded that
this lack of significant benefit did not outweigh the safety profile, especially
as it relates to pregnant and lactating women.

- **Safety concerns:**

–– *Adverse reactions* : Acute hypoglycemia can occur with higher doses of fenu­

greek. It is otherwise considered generally safe to take but may cause gastro­
intestinal upset, dizziness, or allergic reactions. Fenugreek is not considered
safe for use in pregnancy as it may be teratogenic.

- **Drug interactions:**

–– Fenugreek can interact with anticoagulant and antiplatelet medication.
###### **Docosahexaenoic Acid**

- **Other names:** DHA.

- **Mechanism of action:**

–– Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a poly-unsaturated fatty acid found in the

phospholipids of neuronal cell membranes. For this reason, there is evidence
for it as beneficiary for cognitive and visual development and function. There
is also evidence for DHA having a role in innate immunity as an M2 macro­
phage regulator.

- **Common indications/uses:**

–– DHA is not found in high concentrations in a normal human diet and is there­

fore taken as a supplement either separately or can be in fish oil supplements.
It is often taken along with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Like fish oil, DHA
as a supplement is recommended for cognitive and psychological disorders as
well as heart disease.

- **Dosing:**

–– Hyperlipidemia: 1.5 g/day.
–– Breastfeeding women: 200–300 mg/day.
–– It is recommended to take DHA in conjunction with EPA, and they are often

sold as a combined supplement.


-----

2 Green Tea 47

- **Evidence:**

–– Fatty acids are known to be beneficial for cognitive development. DHA in

particular is a component of phospholipids found in neuronal cell membranes.
–– DHA is not readily produced in large quantities from its precursor alpha lin­

oleic acid in the human body, so intake in the diet or supplementation are
required to maintain adequate levels.
–– A study by Kawano et al. found that DHA upregulates krüppel-like factor-4

which is involved in the regulation of macrophage polarization. This in turn
shows some involvement of DHA in the MAP kinase pathway of M2 macro­
phages and innate immunity.

- **Safety concerns:**

–– *Adverse reactions* : Fishy taste, abdominal upset, and increased risk of bleed­

ing have been reported with use of fish oil and DHA/EPA supplements.

- **Drug interactions:**

–– May interact with antihypertensive, anticoagulant, and antiplatelet drugs.
###### **Fiber**

- **Other names:** Inulin, wheat bran, beta-glucan, psyllium.

- **Mechanism of action:**

–– Postprandial glycemic control: Gel-forming fibers, such as psyllium or

B-­glucan will increase viscosity of chyme in the small intestine. By increas­
ing the viscosity, it slows the interactions of digestive enzymes with nutrients,
this slowing down the absorption of glucose, leading to reduced peak of post­
prandial blood glucose concentration. Long term, it has been shown to
improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetics.
–– The physical increase in chyme viscosity can also lower elevated serum cho­

lesterol concentration by trapping and eliminating bile. As chyme becomes
more viscous, bile’s window for reuptake becomes smaller, causing bile to be
lost in stool. Reduction of bile acid causes hepatocytes to stimulate LDL-­
receptor expression leading to increased LDL-cholesterol clearance from
blood to synthesize more bile acids.
–– Laxative effect in two ways: Insoluble fiber (wheat bran) does not dissolve in

water well; thus they mechanically irritate the gut mucosa, stimulating water
secretion helping to soften stool and secondly, soluble gel-forming fiber
retains high water hold capacity, helping to resist dehydration in the large
bowel. Both result in soft and easy-to-pass stools.

- **Common indications/uses:**

–– The use of viscous gel-forming fiber (aka psyllium) is indicated for lowering

cholesterol, improving glycemic control, constipation, and IBS.


-----

48

- **Dosing:**

–– 25 g of fiber per day for women, 38 g of fiber per day for men.

- **Evidence:**


G. Valdez et al.


–– A study done by the American college of Gastroenterology Chronic

Constipation Task Force systematically reviewed clinical evidence and con­
cluded that only psyllium was sufficient for the treatment of chronic
constipation.
–– A 6-month study was done to compare the effects of viscosity on weight loss

by assessing a viscous, gel-forming, nonfermented fiber (psyllium) versus a
less viscous, readily fermented fiber (partially hydrolyzed guar gum). In this
randomized control study, the psyllium treatment group showed gradual and
sustained weight loss across the entire 6-month test period. After 6-months,
there was significant improvement in fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin
A1C, and LDL-cholesterol levels.

- **Safety concerns:**

–– *Adverse reactions* : Abdominal bloating and gas.

- **Drug interactions:**

–– May interact with tricyclic antidepressants, glyburide, metformin, carbam­

azepine, cholestyramine, colestipol, digoxin, lithium.
###### **Fish Oil**

- **Mechanism of action:**

–– Fish oil is a source of omega-3 fatty acids—specifically docosahexaenoic acid

(DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA).

- **Common indications/uses:**

–– Fish oil is taken as a supplement. 1–4 g/day.

- **Dosing:**

–– The only omega-3 fatty acid which has a proven recommended amount is

alpha linoleic acid.

- **Evidence and Safety Concerns are discussed above in the section**

**“Docosahexaenoic Acid.”**

###### **Flavonoid**

- **Other names:** Polyphenols.

–– Subcategories: Flavones, Flavonols, Flavanones, Flavanonols, Chalcones,

Catechins, Anthocyanins.

- **Description:**

–– Flavonoids are a large group of natural substances found in numerous fruits,

vegetables, grains, bark, roots, stems, flowers, and teas.

- **Mechanism of action:**

–– Generally, their health benefits are attributed to their antioxidative, anti-­

inflammatory, and anti-carcinogenic properties. Flavonoids are understood to
contain these properties via numerous mechanisms of action. Each flavonoid
exerts its health effects via varying use of different mechanisms. Some well
understood and studied mechanisms of action are listed below:

1. Anticholinesterase activity via Inhibition of Acetylcholinesterase (AChE)

and Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE)
2. Anti-inflammatory activity via inhibition of COX-2
3. Antioxidant via free radical scavenging

- **Common indications/uses:**

–– Flavonoids are used to either prevent or treat a wide array of disease pro­

cesses. Ongoing investigation in their efficacy has led to a growing list of
potential indications. A list of common and well-studied indications are
listed below:

1. Hypertension prevention and management
2. Lipid management
3. Chronic venous disease management
4. Hemorrhoids

- **Dosing:**

–– In many studies, flavonoid consumption is marked as products high in flavo­

noid content. There is a lack of data regarding precise dosing.
–– Chronic venous disease management

bition against AChE and Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Macluraxanthone
was found to inhibit both enzymes with 50% inhibitory concentration
(IC50) values of 8.47 and 29.8 μm, respectively.
Anti-inflammatory activity: Studies observing binding modes of flavo­
noids, demonstrated that some flavonols and flavones contain a 2,3-double
bound which acts as a preferential inhibitor of COX-2. This discovery led
to the creation selective COX-2 inhibitors.

Antioxidant activity: Flavanoids are oxidized by free radicals resulting in
a more stable, less reactive radical. Research by Hanasaki found that some
flavonoids can directly scavenge superoxides while other flavonoids can
scavenge high reactive oxygen-derived radicals.

–– *Indications and efficacy*

Hypertension: A Cochrane meta-analysis revealed that ingestion of
flavanol-­rich cocoa products significantly reduced both systolic and dia­
stolic pressure compared with low flavonol containing cocoa powder or
flavonol-free interventions (1.8/1.8 mmHg).
Chronic venous disease: a meta-analysis comparing micronized purified
flavonoid fraction (MPFF) to placebo revealed a significant reduction in
pain, heaviness, cramps, paresthesias, leg circumference, leg redness, and
improvement in skin changes and quality of life. Seven trials examining
MPFF and ulcer healing revealed that MPFF significantly improved the
rate of ulcer healing at 6 months (61.3% versus 47.6%) as well as time to
healing (16 versus 21 weeks).
Lipid: A trial of 200 men examining virgin olive oil (high in polyphenols)
versus refined olive oil (low in polyphenols) on serum lipids revealed a
dose-response effect of virgin olive oil on both LDL- and HDL-­cholesterol;
raising HDL- and lowering LDL-cholesterol.
Hemorrhoids: Flavanoids such as hydroxyethylrutoside function as phle­
botonics which improve venous tone, microvascular permeability, lym­
phatic activity, and microcirculatory nutritive flow. Studies have shown its
utility in reducing acute and recurrent hemorrhoidal attacks, as well as
useful in bridging patients to surgery.

- **Safety concerns:**

–– No adverse effects have been associated with high dietary intake of flavonoids

from plant-based food. This is thought to be related to its low bioavailability,
rapid metabolism, and elimination of most flavonoids.

- **Adverse reactions:**

–– Drug-induced liver injury: Flavocoxid, a blend of two flavonoids (baicalin

and catechins) has been used to treat osteoarthritis. The FDA has recom­
mended it be discontinued due to drug-induced liver injury. One study
revealed an incidence of 0.4%.

- **Drug interactions:**

–– Many anthocyanins and anthocyanidins have been described as inhibitors of

BRCP-mediated transport thus theoretically affecting anticancer drugs such
as mitoxantrone, topotecan, tyrosine kinase inhibitor, fluoroquinolones, pra­
zosin, and sulfasalazine.
–– High intake of flavonoids from grape juice and dark chocolate has been found

to inhibit platelet aggregation and thus can theoretically increase the risk of
bleeding when also taken with anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs.
–– Consumption of flavonoid-rich grapefruit inhibits cytochrome P450 and

increase the bioavailability and the risk of toxicity of more than 85 drugs.
###### **Flax Seed**

- **Other names:** Linseed, *Linum usitatissimum.*

–– Common forms: whole flaxseed, ground flaxseed, flaxseed oil.

- **Description:**

–– Flaxseed is a seed that comes from the flax plant.

- **Mechanism of action:**

–– It is thought that Alpha-Linolenic Acid (ALA) contained within flaxseed is

responsible for its anti-hypertensive effect. ALA inhibits the enzyme Soluble
Epoxide Hydrolase (seH) which in turn is responsible for the metabolism of
Epoxy-eicosatrienoic acid (EpETre) into Dihydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid
(DiHETre). Because EpETre contains vasodilatory properties via nitric oxide
synthase, the inhibition of its degradation may lead to more vasodilation and
its anti-hypertensive effect.
–– Flaxseed is thought to exert anti-atherogenic effect via anti-inflammatory and

antiproliferative actions which include a reduction in the expression of IL-6,
VCAM-1 and PCNA.

- **Common indications/uses:**

–– Anti-hypertensive
–– Anti-atherogenic

- **Dosing:**

–– Flaxseed fiber: 7.0–18.9 g/day for anti-hypertensive consumption
–– Ground flaxseed in food: 30 g for anti-hypertensive consumption

- **Evidence:**

–– In a year-long randomized, double-blinded study (FLAX-PAD) revealed that

consumption of 30 g of ground flaxseed was associated with a 10 and 7 mmHg


-----

52 G. Valdez et al.

reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively. The effect was
even larger, with a reduction of 15 mmHg in SBP, in participants who entered
the study with elevated blood pressure.
–– A meta-analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials evaluating flaxseed fiber

consumption and blood pressure reported a significant reduction of SBP (3.4
mmHg) and DBP (1.97 mmHg) with fiber disease between 7.2 and 18.9 g/day.

- **Safety concerns:**

–– In a double-blind study examining BeneFlax consumption and safety, there

were no incidents of hypoglycemia or hypotension observed.
–– Contraindicated in acute or chronic diarrhea, esophageal stricture, inflamma­

tory bowel disease.

- **Adverse reactions:**

–– Adverse reactions from flaxseed are limited. Of reported reactions, they are

often due to drug interactions leading to an increased risk of bleeding.

- **Drug interactions:**

–– May have a synergistic antiplatelet and anticoagulation effect with antiplate­

let medications such as Aspirin and Warfarin, respectively. There have been
case reports of elevated INR, anemia, rectal bleeding, and melena.
###### **Folic Acid**

- **Other names:** Folate, vitamin B9.

- **Description:**

–– Folate is a water-soluble vitamin which plays an essential role in DNA

synthesis.

- **Mechanism of action:**

–– Participates in transfer/methylation reactions which are important in synthe­

sizing nitrogenous bases in DNA and RNA. This is an essential process in the
maturation of red blood cells [1].
–– It has been proposed that folate prevents neural tube defects through its com­

plex relationship with ubiquitination and expression of neural tube closure-­
related genes [1].
–– Folate functions as an important regulator of homocysteine, with its consump­

tion inversely related to homocysteine blood concentration.

- **Common indications/uses:**

–– Neural tube defect prevention
–– Macrocytic and megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency


-----

2 Green Tea 53

–– Vitiligo treatment
–– Cognitive performance
–– Prevention of folic acid deficiency in hemodialysis (HD) patients
–– Stroke prevention

- **Dosing:**

–– Neural tube defect prevention: 0.4–0.5 mg daily beginning 5–6 months before

conception
–– Macrocytic anemia: 1–5 mg daily
–– Prevention of folic acid deficiency in HD dependence: 1–5 mg daily

- **Evidence:**

–– The US preventive service task force recommends periconceptional folic acid

supplementation for the prevention of neural tube defects. It has a grade A
recommendation, the highest recommendation grading based on reviewed
evidence.

–– Randomized controlled trials have documented that dietary supplementation

of folic acid reduces blood levels of homocysteine. Since 1969, there has been
substantial evidence linking homocysteine plasma and risk of cardiovascular
disease via its impact on the atherosclerotic process.
–– The Hope 2 study revealed folic acid supplementation reduced risk of stroke

by 24%. While a meta-analysis indicated that folic acid supplementation can
significantly reduce the risk of stroke in individuals without a history of
stroke, and thus should be considered for primary prevention.
–– Folic acid and its role in improving cognitive function remains unclear, but it

may improve cognitive function by reducing levels of homocysteine.
–– Folic acid may also have a therapeutic role in the treatment of Vitiligo via its

effect on homocysteine.

- **Safety concerns:**

–– Folic acid is generally considered a safe and non-toxic supplement. There is

debate whether it is associated with an increased cancer risk.

- **Adverse reactions:**

–– Increased seizure risk through its interaction with antiepileptic medications.

- **Drug interactions:**

–– Interacts with the metabolism of antiepileptic drugs such as phenytoin, carba­

mazepine, and phenobarbital, reducing serum levels, and increasing the likeli­
hood of seizure.

–– In addition, folic acid interacts with anti-folate drugs such as the chemother­

apy and autoimmune agent methotrexate. Folate may render these drugs less
effective.

###### **Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid**

- **Other names:** GABA; GABA-A GABA-B.

- **Description:**

–– An amino acid.

- **Mechanism of action:**


G. Valdez et al.


–– GABA is an amino acid which functions as the main inhibitory neurotrans­

mitter in the central nervous system. It is packaged in synaptic vesicles and
released into synaptic cleft to target GABA receptors on the postsynaptic sur­
face [2].
–– Interestingly, it has long been believed that GABA is unable to pass the

blood–brain barrier (BBB).

- **Common indications/uses:**

–– Improve cognition/mental focus
–– Anxiety management and stress reduction
–– Promote relaxation and sleep agent
–– Anti-hypertensive

- **Dosing:**

–– GABA 50–100 mg/day.

- **Evidence:**

–– Anti-anxiety: One study reported reduced heart rate variability and salivary

chromagin A, a salivary catecholamine marker, during an arithmetic task
compared to a control group after administration of GABA-enriched choco­
late. A second study reported reduced salivary cortisol and Cga during a psy­
chological stress-inducing arithmetic task. In another study, participants who
consumed 50 mg of GABA reported less psychological fatigue after task
completion compared to placebo. However, this evidence is questionable as
many of these authors are affiliated with the company producing the GABA
supplement.
–– Relaxation and sleep: A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study

sought to examine the impact of GABA on sleep in 40 patients with insomnia.
After 4 weeks of GABA supplementation, sleep latency was decreased and
sleep efficacy was increased as compared to placebo.
–– Anti-hypertensive: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study examining the

effect of GABA on blood pressure in 177 participants, results revealed a
reduction in average systolic blood pressure by 4.6 mmHg in the GABA
treated groups as compared to the control groups. Multiple other studies have
also noted a small reduction in systolic blood pressure.

55


–– The currently held belief is that GABA is unable to cross the blood–brain bar­

rier, but there have been a few recent studies revealing conflicting evidence,
implying it may potentially be able to cross the barrier in small amounts.

- **Safety concerns:**

–– Caution is advised for pregnant and lactating women since GABA can affect

neurotransmitter and the endocrine system.

- **Adverse reactions:**

–– No serious adverse events have been associated with GABA intake with up to

120 mg for 12 weeks. Mild side effects include abdominal discomfort, head­
ache, drowsiness, and transient burning sensation in the throat.

- **Drug interactions:**

–– As GABA is associated with a small reduction in blood pressure, it may work

synergistically with anti-hypertensive medication.
###### **Garcinia Cambogia**

- **Other names:** Garcinia, Malabar Tamarind, Brindle berry.

- **Description:**

–– Small pumpkin-like fruit native to Southeast Asia and Africa.

- **Mechanism of action:**

–– The rind of Garcinia cambogia contains a chemical called hydroxycitric acid

(HCA). It is thought that HCA promotes weight loss via its effect on lipogen­
esis, appetite suppression via serotonin, and fat absorption.
–– HCA inhibits adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase enzyme which converts

citrate to citrate to acetyl coenzyme A and oxaloacetate which contributes to
lipogenesis. Thus, suppression of this enzyme HCA prevents de novo fatty
acid and cholesterol biosynthesis, thereby alleviating subcutaneous and vis­
ceral fat deposition and causing weight loss.
–– HCA raises the level of serotonin in the brain and suppresses appetite and

food intake.

–– HCA also improves fat and carbohydrate metabolism by suppressing intesti­

nal absorption of fat.

- **Common indications/uses:**

–– Weight loss
–– Athletic performance


-----

56

- **Dosing:**

–– Garcinia 1500–5000 mg/day
–– HCA 900–2800 mg/day

- **Evidence:**


G. Valdez et al.


–– Weight loss: A 2020 systematic review examining eight trials of Garcinia

cambogia supplementation and its relationship with obesity revealed a nonlin­
ear association between Garcinia cambogia dosage and change in body
weight. Despite this, the study revealed that Garcinia cambogia had a signifi­

− −
cant effect on body weight ( 1.34 kg), BMI ( 0.99 kg/m [2] ), percentage of fat

− −
mass ( 0.42%), and waist circumference ( 4.16 cm).
–– Athletic performance: In a study examining HCA consumption and glycogen

stores, results revealed that HCA supplementation can effectively increase the
rate of glycogen storage formation in skeletal muscle. This translates to ath­
letic performance as glycogen stores typically take greater than 1 day to be
replete, thus accelerated glycogen repletion may be advantageous for training
in endurance athletes [3].

- **Safety concerns:**

–– Liver injury
–– Serotonin toxicity

- **Adverse reactions:**

–– There have been multiple case reports connecting Garcinia cambogia and

liver injury and hepatotoxicity, with some cases leading to fulminant hepatic
failure requiring liver transplantation. Due to these reported effects, the FDA
has wanted against using products containing Garcinia cambogia.
–– Minor adverse effects include headache, nausea, upper respiratory tract symp­

toms, and gastrointestinal symptoms.

- **Drug interactions:**

–– *SSRIs* : Garcinia cambogia may increase serotonin concentrations; thus, it

may synergistically interact with serotonin reuptake inhibitors further increase
serotonin concentrations, potentially leading to serotonin toxicity.
###### **Garlic**

- **Other names:** *Allium sativum* .

- **Description:**

–– Garlic is the edible bulb from a plant in the lily family.


-----

2 Green Tea 57

- **Mechanism of action:**

–– Diallyl disulfide is a component of garlic oil that has been found to inhibit

3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG CoA) reductase in a concentration-­
dependent manner. HMG CoA reductase is a key enzyme in the formation of
cholesterol synthesis; thus, its inhibition reduces cholesterol formation, simi­
lar to the mechanism of action of statin medication.

–– It is hypothesized that garlic improves blood pressure through inhibition of

angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), down regulation of angiotensin II
receptor, and through stimulation of nitric oxide formation.
–– Garlic is also thought to have antimicrobial and anti-viral properties.

- **Common indications/uses:**

–– Hyperlipidemia
–– Hypertension
–– Common cold prevention

- **Dosing:**

–– 2–5 g of fresh raw garlic
–– 300–2400 mg/day

- **Evidence:**

–– The most comprehensive meta-analysis conducted to date included 39 pri­

mary trials evaluating the effect on garlic preparation on total cholesterol,
LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides. The study revealed that
garlic was effective in reducing total serum cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol
in individuals with elevated total cholesterol levels if used for longer than 2
months. The observed mean reduction of total serum cholesterol was 8% and

was associated with a 38% reduction in risk of coronary events at 50 years of
age. HDL-cholesterol levels improved only slightly and triglycerides were not
influenced significantly. Despite these findings, there continues to be ongoing
controversy whether garlic supplementation can truly and significantly impact
hyperlipidemia.
–– Most clinical trial support the assumption that garlic may moderately decrease

arterial blood pressure in hypertensive subjects. A meta-analysis of seven ran­
domized placebo-controlled trials reported a significant lowering effect of
garlic on both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, by 6.7 and 4.8 mmHg,
respectively.
–– In one 12-week randomized controlled trial of 146 participants evaluating

cold prevention with garlic supplementation versus placebo and standard
treatment demonstrated 24 occurrences of the common cold in the interven­

tion group as compared to 65 in the placebo group. The trial also revealed a
few days of illness (111 versus 366). Seeing as there is only one randomized
controlled trial supporting Garlic’s effect on cold prevention, more evidence
is needed.


-----

58 G. Valdez et al.

- **Safety concerns:**

–– Garlic is generally considered a safe supplement. The known adverse effects

are considered mild, nevertheless attention should be paid to its few herb–
drug interactions.

- **Adverse reactions:**

–– Side effects are more noticeable with raw garlic. The most commonly docu­

mented side effects are breath and body odor. Other side effects include heart­
burn, upset stomach, and applied directly on skin; burns are possible. As like
many other substances, there is also a risk of allergic reaction.

- **Drug interactions:**

–– As garlic supplementation may increase the risk of bleeding, bleeding risk

may be further exacerbated with concurrent use of anticoagulants such as
Warfarin.
–– Garlic may reduce the efficacy of anti-AIDS drugs such as Saquinavir.
###### **Ginger**

- **What is it and how does it work in the body?**

–– Ginger is the spicy and flavorful root of the flowering plant *Zingiber offici­*

*nale.* The exact origins of the plant are unknown, but it is likely that ginger is
native to Southeast Asia. Ginger’s current name comes from the Middle
English *gingivere*, but this spice dates back over 3000 years to the Sanskrit
word *srngaveram*, meaning “horn root,” based on its appearance. In Greek, it
was called *zingiberis*, and in Latin, *zingiberi* .
–– Ginger is not only an extremely popular dietary condiment used for flavoring

food but also an herb that has been used for thousands of years as a medicinal
supplement to treat a variety of ailments.
–– It is believed that Indians and Chinese have produced ginger as a tonic root for

over 5000 years to treat many ailments, and this plant is now cultivated
throughout the humid tropics, with India being the largest producer.
–– It was an exceedingly important article of trade and was exported from India

to the Roman Empire over 2000 years ago, where it was especially valued for
its medicinal properties.
–– In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the value of a pound of ginger was

equivalent to the cost of a sheep. By medieval times, it was being imported in
preserved form to be used in sweets.
–– When you consume ginger, you are eating the thick root, also known as the

rhizome which is the edible portion of the plant. It is available in the produce
section of most grocery stores. Dried and ground ginger can also commonly
be found in the herbs and spices aisle.

–– Ginger is used in numerous forms, including fresh, dried, pickled, preserved,

crystallized, candied, and powdered or ground. The flavor is somewhat pep­
pery and slightly sweet, with a strong and spicy aroma. The concentration of
essential oils increases as ginger ages and, therefore, the intended use of the
rhizome determines the time when it is harvested. If extracting the oil is the
main purpose, then ginger can be harvested at 9 months or longer. Ginger is
commonly pickled in sweet vinegar, which turns it into a pink color, which is
popular with sushi. Ginger harvested at 8–9 months has a tough skin that must
be removed before eating, and the root is more pungent and is usually dried or
pulverized into ground ginger. This is the form found in spice bottles and used
in cookies, cakes, and curry mixes.
–– Candied or crystallized ginger is cooked in sugar syrup and coated with gran­

ulated sugar. Ginger harvested at 5 months is not yet mature and has a very
thin skin, and the rhizomes are tender with a mild flavor and are best used in
fresh or preserved forms.

- **What is it used for and at what dosage?**

–– The unique compounds within ginger are thought to be the primary source of

its health benefits. The oleoresin (i.e., oily resin) from the rhizomes, the edible
root, of ginger contains many bioactive components. Ginger has been frac­
tionated into at least 14 bioactive compounds, including [4]-gingerol, [6]-gin­
gerol, [8]-gingerol, [10]-gingerol, [6]-paradol, [14]-shogaol, [6]-shogaol,
1-dehydro-[10]-gingerdione, [10]-gingerdione, hexahydrocurcumin, tetrahy­
drocurcumin, gingerenone A, 1,7-bis-(4′-hydroxyl-3′-methoxyphenyl)-5-­
methoxyhepthan-­3-one, and methoxy-[10]-gingerol. The proportion of each
individual component in a sample of ginger depends on country of origin,
commercial processor, and whether the ginger is fresh, dried, or processed.

′ ′–– The primary component of these is gingerol (1-[4 -hydroxy-3

methoxyphenyl]-5-hydroxy-3-decanone) which is the primary pungent ingre­
dient that is believed to exert a variety of remarkable pharmacological and
physiological activities. In general, ginger is deemed safe but the lack of a full
understanding of its mechanism of action is the reason why there is some cau­
tion in its therapeutic properties.
–– However, ginger has been used for medicinal use for thousands of years. It has

shown to contain antioxidant properties and reduces inflammatory enzymes.
–– Therefore, ginger is thought to be beneficial for pain relief, specifically

arthritis-­based conditions, and menstrual cramps. Ginger has been linked to
treating chronic pain rather than alleviating acute pain symptoms.
–– One study showed that ginger oil (33 mg/kg), administered orally to rats for

26 days, caused a significant repression of paw and joint swelling associated
with severe chronic adjuvant arthritis. More recently, the effectiveness of a
crude ginger extract was compared with a fraction containing only gingerols
and derivatives to inhibit joint swelling in the streptococcal cell wall-induced
arthritis animal model of rheumatoid arthritis.


-----

60 G. Valdez et al.

–– The most common and well-established use of ginger throughout history is

probably its utilization in alleviating symptoms of nausea and vomiting. The
benefits and dangers of herbal treatment of liver and gastrointestinal distress
have been reviewed, and several controlled studies have reported that ginger
is generally effective as an antiemetic. The effectiveness of ginger as an anti­
emetic has been attributed to its carminative effect, which helps to break up
and expel intestinal gas. This idea was supported by the results of a random­
ized, double-blind trial in which healthy volunteers reported that ginger effec­
tively accelerated gastric emptying and stimulated antral contractions.
–– The cases where ginger has been shown to be most effective are nausea and

vomiting associated with pregnancy, chemotherapy, and some types of sur­
gery. The clinical data undoubtedly indicate that ginger is at least as effective
and may be better than vitamin B6 in treating these symptoms. Again, mecha­
nisms are lacking, but no reports indicate that ginger has any adverse side
effects or that it can worsen illness in pregnant women or patients.
–– In addition, ginger helps with blood sugar regulation by reducing enzymes

that break down carbohydrates. Studies have found that ginger helps with
glucose absorption without the need of increased insulin.

- **Safety concerns, side effects, and precautions?**

–– Ginger is recognized by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a

food additive that is “generally recognized as safe.” However, and notably, in
1930, thousands of Americans were poisoned and paralyzed by an illicit
extract of Jamaican ginger (jake) that was used to circumvent prohibition
laws. The extract had been adulterated with a neurotoxic organophosphate
compound, triorthocresyl phosphate. The extract was banned in 1931.
–– One study showed that oral administration of a ginger extract (1000 mg/kg) to

pregnant rats had no adverse effects on the mothers or in the development of
fetuses. However, this result differed result to an earlier study, in which
administration of ginger tea to pregnant rats resulted in twice the loss of
embryos but heavier surviving fetuses compared to untreated controls.
–– In a more recent study, male and female rats that were fed ginger powder

(500, 1000, or 2000 mg/kg BW) by gavage for 35 days did not exhibit any
overall mortalities or abnormalities in behavior, growth, or food and water
consumption. No overt organ abnormalities were observed and hematological
and blood biochemical parameters in treated and untreated control animals
were similar.

- **Conclusion:**

–– More studies are needed on the long-term effects ginger has on health and

better ways to utilize it in our everyday diet. Specific molecular targets and
mechanisms of action need to be identified to understand what interactions
this supplement has with other medications or dietary limitations. Ginger

clearly has a vast number of components and metabolites, many of which
have not been studied in detail.
–– Overall, ginger has many beneficial effects and has a myriad of enhancements

in many areas of life.
###### **Goji**

- **Other names:** *Lycium barbarum* .

- **Mechanism of action:**

–– Contains a very high amount of anthocyanins which gives it it’s antioxidant

activity, anti-inflammatory and antilipidemic activity by increasing the pro­
duction of antioxidant enzymes, suppressing inflammatory factors and raising
serum HDL levels.

- **Common indications/uses:**

–– Antioxidant, benefits vision by protecting from hypopigmentation and soft

drusen accumulation in the macula (shown in a study done on elderly patients).

- **Dosing:**

–– Insufficient data to recommend.

- **Evidence:**

–– A study done on lipid-lowering effects showed that the group of mice supple­

mented with goji extract had significantly lower concentrations of triglycer­
ides and total cholesterol compared to the diabetic control group.
–– Tang et al. (2012) tested goji berries and found to have pro-apoptotic and anti­

proliferative activity against cancer cells. Gan et al. (2004) confirmed that goji
polysaccharide fractions could inhibit the growth of transplantable sarcoma in
mice, increase macrophage phagocytosis and antibody secretion by spleen cells.
–– Yu et al. (2013) showed that bioactive compounds present in *L. barbarum*

enhance the expression of zeaxanthin and luteolin genes in diabetic mice, thus
having neuroprotective properties on a diabetic animal’s retina.
–– Chemical analysis of the goji berry shows its high antioxidative activity,

showing its scavenging activity against free radicals. Goji antioxidative
­activity is mainly due to carotenoid pigments, flavonoids, polysaccharide
fraction, and vitamin analog C-2-O ascorbic acid.

- **Safety concerns:**

–– The high content of atropine (0.95%) present in goji fruit was tested in berries

from India in 1989. However, published case reports do not describe people
who have experienced atropine poisoning. There was no detected atropine in
both studies using HPLC-PAD and TLC methods. Using HPLC-MS method,
a small amount of atropine found, with a maximum concentration of 19 ppb,
well below toxic level.

62

- **Adverse reactions:**


G. Valdez et al.


–– Allergic reaction—only seen in a few cases. Led to anaphylaxis, urticaria on

hands, palms and lips, edema, dyspnea, and acute rhinitis. Skin prick testing
show a high degree of cross-reactivity between goji berry and peach
and tomato.

- **Drug interactions:**

–– Warfarin (elevates INR, increased bleeding from rectum and nose shown in

three case reports).
###### **Glucosamine**

- **Other names:** Brand names: glucosamine and chondroitin, osteo bi-flex

advanced.

- **Mechanism of action:**

–– d-Glucosamine from exogenous sources was shown to incorporate into the

metabolic pathway of glycosaminoglycan synthesis. In vitro studies show that
glucosamine stimulates the production of proteoglycans and increases the sul­
fate uptake by articular cartilage.

- **Common indications/uses:**

–– Osteoarthritis.

- **Dosing:**

–– Recommended dosage is 500 mg three times daily because of greater experi­

ence in clinical trials

- **Evidence:**

–– Braham et al. [4] did a study and showed that glucosamine supplementation

(2000 mg/day, for 12 weeks) may result in decreased pain ratings and self-­
reported improvements in functional ability of patients with chronic knee pain.

- **Safety concerns:**

–– One case report discussed a case of asthma being exacerbated by the use of

glucosamine supplement for OA, and the physician should keep underlying
conditions in mind when discussing supplementation.

- **Adverse reactions:**

–– Overall adverse effects from glucosamine are minimal, mainly consisting of

minor GI symptoms (nausea, vomiting, GI cramps, headache, bloating,
dry mouth).

- **Drug interactions:**

–– No drug interactions were found.
###### **Glutamine**


63



- **Other names:** Endari, Nutrestore, Enterex Glutapak-10, Resource Glutasolve,

Sympt-X.

- **Mechanism of action:**

–– Glutamine is an amino acid that is normally produced in the body and has a

large variety of biochemical functions which include: (1) synthesis of pro­
teins, DNA precursors, lipids; (2) energy production in ATP synthesis; (3)
regulation of intestinal mucosa, and many others. The lungs, liver, brain, skel­
etal muscles, and adipose tissue have glutamine synthesis activity. Glutamine
is considered a conditionally essential amino acid as endogenous synthesis
does not meet bodily demands in certain catabolic conditions such as cancer,
sepsis, infections, surgeries, traumas, and prolonged intense exercise. Skeletal
muscles play a fundamental role in glutamine metabolism as intramuscular
glutamine content corresponds to 50–60% of the total free amino acids found
in skeletal muscles.

- **Common indications/uses:**

–– Exhaustive and prolonged exercise
–– Oral mucositis prevention secondary to chemo
–– Short gut syndrome
–– Sickle cell disease

- **Dosing:**

–– *Exhaustive prolonged exercise* : 20–30 g have been tolerated without any

adverse concerns. Typically dosed 10 g a day on current nutritional
supplements.
–– *Oral mucositis* *prevention* *secondary to chemo* : 10–30 g daily [5].
–– *Short bowel syndrome* : 30 g daily with other nutritional supplemental and

growth hormone for up to 4 weeks [6].
–– *Sickle cell disease* : FDA approved (Endari)—dosing based on weight [7].

|Weight in kg|Dose|
|---|---|
|Less than 30 kg|5 g PO twice a day|
|30–60 kg|10 g PO twice a day|
|>65 kg|15 g PO twice a day|

- **Evidence:**


G. Valdez et al.


–– *Exhaustive/prolonged exercise* : A review by Coqueiro et al. [8] consisting of

55 studies looking at the anti-fatigue effects of glutamine after exercise
showed that glutamine supplementation increased muscle glycogen synthesis
and reduced ammonia accumulation induced by exercise and attenuated
markers of muscle damage such as blood CK and LDH levels. However, there
was limited effect on physical performance.
–– *Oral mucositis* *prevention secondary to chemo* : The most recent MASCC/

ISOO guidelines for management of mucositis secondary to cancer therapy
suggested oral glutamine tablets in patients with head and neck cancer receiv­
ing RT-CT, based on two RCTs showed that glutamine dosed between 10 and
30 daily during RT-CT may prevent oral mucositis [5].
–– *Short gut syndrome* : A study by Guo et al. [6] showed that among 12 patients

with short bowel syndrome, oral glutamine (30 g daily), growth hormone
(0.05 mg/kg/day), and enteral supplementation for 4 weeks resulted in
improved intestinal absorptive capacity, plasma level of proteins, and overall
nutrition status.

–– *Sickle cell disease* : The FDA approved Endari (l-glutamine supplement) in

2017 to reduce acute sickle cell flares in adult and pediatric patients older than
5 years old, based on a multicenter phase 3 trial looking at glutamine supple­
mentation among 230 patients with sickle cell disease, showing a significant
decrease in pain crises and fewer hospitalizations [7].

- **Safety concerns:**

–– There are minimal safety concerns if taken at the recommended dose (<40

mg/day).
–– In one case study, a female athlete who had increased alcohol consumption

experienced hepatotoxicity with chronic glutamine supplementation [9], war­

- **Mechanism of action:**


65


–– Glutathione is a tripeptide, a substance consisting of three amino acids: cyste­

ine, glutamate, and glycine.
–– The critical roles of glutathione include:

Direct chemical neutralization of singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radicals, and
superoxide radicals
Cofactor for several antioxidant enzymes
Regeneration of vitamins C and E
Neutralization of free radicals produced by Phase I liver metabolism of
chemical toxins

One of approximately seven liver Phase II reactions, which conjugate the
activated intermediates produced by Phase I to make them water soluble
for excretion by the kidneys
Transportation of mercury out of cells and the brain
Regulation of cellular proliferation and apoptosis
Vital to mitochondrial function and maintenance of mitochondrial

DNA (mtDNA)

- **Common indications/uses:**

–– People take glutathione for its antioxidant power and as a detoxification agent.

There are multiple diseases associated with low levels of glutathione, includ­
ing: Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, COPD, asthma, HIV, hypertension, myocardial
infarction, macular degeneration, glaucoma, cystic fibrosis, and the aging pro­
cess itself. Direct administration of glutathione has been proved to be effec­
tive in the diseases mentioned above.

- **Dosing:**

–– Insufficient data to recommend.

- **Evidence (by indication):**

–– Insufficient data to recommend.

- **Safety concerns:**

–– Long-term use of glutathione is linked to low zinc levels. In addition, inhaled

glutathione can cause wheezing and exacerbate asthma attacks. It is unknown
if this substance is safe to take during pregnancy.

- **Adverse reactions:**

–– Insufficient data to recommend.

- **Drug interactions:**

–– Insufficient data to recommend.

###### **Green Tea**

- **Other names:** *Camellia sinensis* .

- **Mechanism of action:**


G. Valdez et al.


–– Ohishi et al. state that green tea’s main component epigallocatechin-3-gallate,

or EGCG, is a major reason for the anti-inflammatory benefits of green tea.
EGCG works as an antioxidant and also suppresses expression of inflamma­
tory cytokines and enzymes. Some of the anti-inflammatory benefits of green
tea are likely a benefit of their polyphenol content [11]. One type of polyphe­
nol are flavanoids which are discussed in depth earlier in this chapter. In short,
flavanoids have a variety of mechanisms of action which may contribute to
their anti-inflammatory properties including acting as antioxidants via COX-2
inhibition and inhibiting acetylcholinesterase.

- **Common indications/uses:**

–– People drink variations of green tea world-wide for cultural, recreational, and

medicinal reasons.

- **Dosing:**

–– The composition of green tea varieties has been studied many times and var­

ies depending on the growing conditions and processing of the leaves. For
example, Japanese Matcha tea may typically contain about 6.5% polyphenols
by weight.

- **Adverse reactions:**

–– Adverse reactions to green tea are more likely when it is used in concentrated

forms such as green tea extract. For example, a case report by Molinari et al.

[12] reported acute liver failure resulting in liver transplant following the use
of green tea extract at 720 mg/day for 6 months.

- **Drug interactions:**

–– Green tea may interact with some common medications including statins,

folic acid, and lisinopril.

#### **Hawthorn–Lysine**

**Esha Jain, Chibuike Ezeibe, and Glenn Adesoji**
###### **Hawthorn**

- **What Is It?**

–– Hawthorn ( *Crataegus monogyna,* *Crataegus laevigata* ) is a flowering shrub or

tree of the Rosaceae (rose) family [1]. It is known to develop and thrive in
temperate regions throughout the world [2].

- **How Does It Work in the Body?**

–– Derived from the flower, leaves, and fruits of the plant, hawthorn is also

known in Asia as Shan Zha. It is used in traditional Chinese medicine to

improve digestion and treat heart problems. Hawthorn also has a long history
in European medicine as a heart tonic [1].
–– Studies in the lab suggest a range of anti-inflammation, heart-protective, and

digestion-improving properties. Studies in humans show benefits in patients
with congestive heart failure although a few trials did not [1].
–– More studies are needed to confirm safety and effectiveness of hawthorn. In

addition, it should not be used in place of conventional heart failure therapies
and its use should be monitored by the treating physician [1].

- **What Is It Used for?**


E. Jain et al.


–– In traditional Chinese medicine, hawthorn fruits are used for relieving indi­

gestion and promoting stomach function, improving blood circulation, and
removing blood stasis; however, clinical studies are lacking [1, 3, 4].
–– In European herbal medicine, hawthorn flowers have been used as an astrin­

gent, antispasmodic, cardiotonic, and diuretic; hawthorn has been thought to
aid as a hypotensive and/or anti-atherosclerotic agent; data are conflicting.
More research is needed [1, 3, 5].
–– In some studies, hawthorn extract used as add-on therapy was found to be

beneficial in heart failure patients. More definitive data are needed [1, 3, 4, 6].

- **Precautions/Side Effects:**

–– Generally, hawthorn is well tolerated. However, individuals may experience

dizziness (most common) and nausea, cardiac and gastrointestinal complaints
(infrequent and mild) with use [1].
–– Overdose can potentially cause hypotension and irregular heartbeat (arrhyth­

mia) [1].

- **Evidence for and Against:**

–– In a study on 2681 patients suffering from congestive heart failure, the admin­

istration of hawthorn extract (900 mg/day) for 6 months showed no positive
clinical effects in inflammation, oxidative stress, neurohormones, functional
capacity, and quality-of-life measures, but modest change in left ventricular
ejection fraction was found [7].
–– However, according to the findings of Trexler et al. [8], 160 mg of hawthorn

supplementation in adult subjects for a week could not influence electrocar­
diographic indices [7].
–– Moeini et al. showed that 5 mL of hawthorn fruit extract after each meal in

male and female patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease controlled the
main symptoms over 4 weeks, as well as causing a 94.2% and 93.5% allevia­
tion in regurgitation and heartburn, respectively [7].

- **Dosage:**

–– The recommended daily dose of hawthorn is 160–900 mg of a native water-­

ethanol extract of the leaves or flowers (equivalent to 30–169 mg of epicate­
chin or 3.5–19.8 mg of flavonoids) administered in two or three doses [6].
–– At therapeutic dosages, hawthorn may cause a mild rash, headache, sweating,

dizziness, palpitations, sleepiness, agitation, and gastrointestinal symp­
toms [6].

- **Interactions:**

–– Use of hawthorn with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil)

may lead to hypotension [9].

71


–– Because hawthorn can be used to help with hypertension, it may interact with

drugs used to treat high blood pressure (e.g., beta blockers such as atenolol,
calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem) and result in hypotension [9].
–– Taking hawthorn along with digoxin and/or nitrates may increase the effects

of such cardiogenic drugs and increase the risk of cardiotoxic side effects [9].
###### **Hazelnut Extract/Oil**

- **What Is It?**

–– Also known as *Corylus avellana*, hazelnut is a species of flowering plant in

the birch family *Betulaceae* and is native to Europe and Western Asia [10].

- **How Does It Work in the Body?**

–– Hazelnuts contain high amounts of protein, dietary fiber, vitamin E, iron, thia­

min, phosphorus, manganese, and magnesium [11].
–– Hazelnuts are a significant source of total fat, accounting for 93% DV in a

100-g amount [11].

- **What Is It Used for?**

–– Hazelnut has been used for high cholesterol and other forms of hyperlipid­

emia (high levels of fats in the blood), heart disease, dementia, and obesity;
however, there is insufficient data to support these medicinal uses [12, 13].

- **Precautions/Side Effects:**

–– Hazelnut is likely safe for most people in food amounts. But some people are

allergic to hazelnuts and have had life-threatening allergic reactions (anaphy­
laxis) [12, 13].

- **Evidence for and Against:**

–– In a study, the nutraceutical potential of two hazelnut varieties (Turkey and

Italy) were examined [14]:

–– Turkish hazelnut had the higher concentration of phenolic acids, flavonoids,

higher antioxidant capacity and enzyme inhibition properties, and lower satu­
rated fatty acid concentration than the Italian sample.

In vivo studies showed that compared to the Italian hazelnuts, the addition
of Turkish hazelnuts to high-fat diet was associated with a more significant
decrease in body weight, food consumption, atherogenic index, lipid per­
oxidation levels and biochemical/morphological markers of liver injury.
The two hazelnut varieties were protective against β-amyloid-induced neu­
rochemical changes and high-fat diet-induced iteration of metabolic
indices.


-----

72 E. Jain et al.

- **Dosage:**

–– The appropriate dose of hazelnut depends on several factors such as the user’s

age, health, and several other conditions. There is not sufficient scientific data
to determine an appropriate range of doses for hazelnut [12, 13].

- **Interactions:**

–– There is currently no information on hazelnut drug–drug interactions [12, 13].
###### **Hemp Seed Oil (HSO)**

- **What Is It?**

–– Hemp seed oil is extracted from cold pressing seeds of the hemp plant. It is

derived from the cannabis plants originated from Central Asia, but it differs
from cannabis in that HSO does not contain significant amounts of tetrahy­
drocannabinol (THC) [15, 16].

- **How Does It Work in the Body?**

–– Hemp contains chemicals that may affect the heart and might help reduce

blood pressure [17, 18].
–– Hemp also contains terpenes, which have may have the following benefits

[18, 19]:

Neuroprotective or brain-protective benefits.
Anti-inflammatory benefits.
Anti-tumor properties.

- **What Is It Used for?**

–– Hemp seed oil contains a 3:1 ratio of omega-6 (Linoleic Acid (LA)) to

omega-3 (Alpha-Linolenic Acid (ALA)) Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids
(PUFAs) and has anti-inflammatory properties which help with pain reduc­
tion [15, 16].
–– Hemp seed oil contains gamma-linolenic acid (GLA); studies have shown that

natural herbs rich in GLA are effective in relieving symptoms of inflamma­
tory conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), rheumatoid arthritis
(RA), and multiple sclerosis (MS) [15, 16].
–– Hemp seed oil is high in omega-3 fatty acid. While omega-3 fatty acids are

vital during pregnancy as they support healthy brain and eye development for
the baby, there is not enough evidence to prove the safety of hemp during
pregnancy or while breastfeeding [15, 18].

- **Precautions/Side Effects:**

–– Hemp seed oil is used lower blood pressure. However, in individuals with

chronic hypotension, the use of HSO may potentiate hypotensive effects [15].


-----

3 Hawthorn–Lysine 73

- **Evidence for and Against:**

–– Callaway et al performed a randomized, single blind crossover study with

patients diagnosed with atopic dermatitis. They found after 8 weeks, patients
reported significant improvement in skin dryness and itchiness (p = 0.027)
and dermal medications decreased (p = 0.024) [20].

- **Dosage:**

–– The Food and Drug Administration has not issued a recommended daily

allowance (RDA) for hemp seed oil. However, one should be advised to never
exceed the recommended dosage on the package insert [15, 18].
–– Researchers estimate that three tablespoons of hemp seed oil per day can

provide the amount of 3:1 fatty acid ratio needed for a healthy diet [15].
–– One tablespoon (15 mL) of hemp seed oil contains [15]:

Calories: 125.

Total fat: 14 g.
Saturated fatty acids: 1 g.
Monounsaturated fatty acids: 2 g.
Polyunsaturated fatty acids: 11 g.

- **Interactions:**

–– The combination of cardiac glycosides (digoxin) and hemp seed may potenti­

ate bradycardia effects and cause arrythmias [18].
–– The use of diuretics and hemp together may result in severely hypokalemia

(low potassium levels). This may lead to arrythmias [18].
###### **Horny Goat Weed**

- **What Is It?**

–– Horny goat weed is an over-the-counter herb with the active ingredient Icariin,

an extract of Epimedium, is a genus of flowering plants in the family
*Berberidaceae* [21]. It is used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat fatigue,
arthritic pain, nerve pain, and sexual dysfunction [22].

- **How Does It Work in the Body?**

–– The active ingredient in horny goat weed is Icariin, a weak phosphodiesterase

type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, allowing blood to fill the arteries and the three cylin­
ders in the penis and create an erection [23, 24].


-----

74

- **What Is It Used for?**


E. Jain et al.


–– Horny goat weed is traditionally used in herbal formulas for sexual dysfunc­

tion, due to its weak PDE5 inhibition. However, additional research is needed
to verify such effects [22].
–– *Epimedium* is traditionally used for fatigue, but it has not been studied in

clinical trials [22].
–– A small, randomized trial shows that *Epimedium* may help prevent bone loss

in women who have had menopause for a long time [22].

- **Precautions/Side Effects:**

–– Excessive dosages of horny goat weed may cause diaphoresis (sweating) and

hot flashes—however, safety evaluations are scarce [22, 25].

- **Evidence for and Against:**

–– As per Shindel et al., rats treated with low-dose icariin (ICA) demonstrated

significantly higher intracavernous pressure/mean arterial pressure (ICP/
MAP) and area under the curve/mean arterial pressure (AUC/MAP) ratios
compared with control and single-dose ICA animals. Immunohistochemistry
and Western blot were revealing of significantly greater positivity for neuro­
nal nitrous oxide synthase (nNOS) and calponin in penile tissues of all rats
treated with ICA. ICA led to significantly greater neurite length in cultured
specimens of pelvic ganglia [24].
–– A case study of an elderly man with congestive heart failure presenting with

shortness of breath, angina, and new-onset symptomatic arrhythmia after tak­
ing horny goat weed daily for 2 weeks to increase sexual pleasure. The side
effects and drug interactions of horny goat weed are difficult to interpret con­
sidering variability in the contents of herbal formulations. Herbal products
may contain a host of other pharmacologically active substances, including
coumarins, glycosides, alkaloids, and flavonoids, some of which have been
demonstrated to inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes [22, 26].

- **Dosage:**

–– There is no FDA recommended dosage for horny goat weed other than the

recommended serving size as set by the manufacturer [23].
–– Thus, the amount of horny goat weed varies—generally 500 to 1000 mg per

serving—depending on the brand [23].

- **Interactions:**

–– Prolonged use of *Epimedium* can induce CYP3A4 through the activation of

pregnane X receptor. The clinical relevance is unknown [22].
–– Icariin enhances the action of aromatase, which may reduce the effect of aro­

matase inhibitors, like anastrozole, exemestane, and letrozole. The clinical
relevance is unknown [22, 27].

3 Hawthorn–Lysine
###### **Hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB)**

- **What Is It?**


75


–– Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a metabolite of the amino acid

leucine and is often used as a body building supplement to improve muscle
strength while reducing protein breakdown [28].

- **How Does It Work in the Body?**

–– HMB is a by-product of the amino acid leucine. Along with arginine and glu­

tamine, these compounds prevent or reduce damage to muscle cells that
occurs with intense exercise or in advanced cancers and AIDS [28, 29].

- **What Is It Used for?**

–– HMB can be used to prevent or reverse cancer- or HIV-related weight loss and

weakness; however, there is limited research in these populations with con­
flicting results [28].
–– HMB is used historically to increase muscle mass. As mentioned before,

HMB is an amino acid metabolite that aids in building muscle with halting
protein breakdown. However, meta-analyses currently suggest that any bene­
fits with HMB supplementation are small [28].

- **Precautions/Side Effects:**

–– HMB appears to be generally safe and well tolerated, with little to no known

side effects. HMB appears to be generally safe in standard doses of 3 g daily
or less up to 1 year [30, 31].

- **Evidence for and Against:**

–– A study by Asjodi et al. demonstrated that hydroxymethylbutyrate supple­

mentation can decrease serum creatine kinase and delay the onset of muscle
soreness, while increasing the range of motion in certain joints. The use of
HMB may also be able to repair cell wall damage during the activities [32].

- **Dosage:**

–– The standard dose of HMB is a maximum of 3 g daily [30, 31].

- **Interactions:**

–– Studies indicate that the stimulating effect of HMB on mammalian target of

rapamycin (mTOR) is reduced by rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor. HMB’s
ability to reduce the effectiveness of these drugs is unknown [28].


-----

76
###### **Indole-3-Carbinol (I3C)**

- **What Is It?**


E. Jain et al.


–– Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) is formed from the breakdown of a substance called

glucosinolate glucobrassicin. Glucobrassicin is found in vegetables such as
broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, collards, cauliflower, kale, mustard
greens, turnips, and rutabagas [33].

- **How Does It Work in the Body?**

–– I3C is known to stimulate detoxifying enzymes in the gut and liver. Diets high

in these vegetables slow cancer growth in animals, believing I3C to be a good
candidate for cancer prevention [34].

- **What Is It Used for?**

–– Cancer Prevention

Studies indicate that I3C may have protective qualities against various can­
cers; however, some animal studies suggest that I3C supplementation
might have tumor-promoting effects. Further research is required [34].

–– Treatment of Viral Infections

Lab studies suggest immune function and antiviral effects, but no studies
have been conducted in humans [34].

- **Precautions/Side Effects:**

–– Mild adverse events have been reported dependent on dosage and use: abdom­

inal discomfort, bloating, nausea, vomiting, asthma, breast tenderness, chest
pain, constipation, diarrhea/loose stools, dizziness, headache, musculoskele­
tal complaints, rash, sciatic nerve pain, and upper respiratory symptoms [35].

- **Evidence for and Against:**

–– New anticancer agents with overlapping underlying mechanisms have

emerged via structural optimization of I3C and its metabolite 3,3′-diindolyl­
methane (DIM), which may provide therapeutic advantages with respect to
chemical stability and anti-tumor potency [36].
–– Numerous in situ studies have implicated indole-3-carbinol as one of the phy­

tochemicals with anticancer properties. Recent studies on the role of I3C in
Arabidopsis (rockcress) opens the door for cross-kingdom comparisons that
can help in understanding the role of this chemical in both plant biology and
combatting cancer [37].

- **Dosage:**

–– There is not enough scientific information to determine an appropriate range

of doses for I3C [33].


-----

3 Hawthorn–Lysine

- **Interactions:**


77


–– Laboratory studies suggest I3C induces CYP 1A2; however, the clinical rel­

evance is unproven [34].
###### **Inosine**

- **What Is It?**

–– Inosine is a purine nucleoside in RNA formed by hypoxanthine linked by its

N9 nitrogen to the C1 carbon of ribose [38].

- **How Does It Work in the Body?**

–– When people take inosine by mouth, it is changed in the body to make a

chemical called uric acid. Uric acid acts like an antioxidant and might protect
cells in the brain [39].

- **What Is It Used for?**

–– Although there is some theoretical rationale, available studies indicate that

inosine supplementation has no apparent effect on aerobic or anaerobic exer­
cise performance [40].

- **Precautions/Side Effects:**

–– When taken by mouth, inosine is considered safe. Inosine becomes uric acid

when taken by mouth. High levels of inosine can result in uric acid in the
blood and urine, leading to possible kidney or bladder stones [39].

- **Evidence for and Against:**

–– Studies have shown that in adult rats with unilateral cortical infarcts, inosine

stimulated neurons on the undamaged side of the brain to extend new projec­
tions to denervated areas of the midbrain and spinal cord. The growth was
paralleled by improved performance on several behavioral measures [41].

- **Dosage:**

–– Inosine has most often been used by adults at a dose of 1–3 g by mouth daily

for up to 2 years [39].

- **Interactions:**

–– Inosine increases levels of uric acid. High levels of uric acid might make gout

worse. Taking inosine along with chronic gout medications and uricosuric
drugs might reduce their effects [39].


-----

78
###### **Inositol Nicotinate**

- **What Is It?**


E. Jain et al.


–– Inositol nicotinate, also known as Inositol hexaniacinate/hexanicotinate or

“no-flush niacin,” is a niacin ester and vasodilator [42].

- **How Does It Work in the Body?**

–– Inositol nicotinate releases niacin, or vitamin B3, when processed in the body.

Niacin causes vasodilation, lowers blood levels of fats such as cholesterol,
LDL, and triglycerides, and breaks up a protein needed for the clotting of
blood [43, 44].

- **What Is It Used for?**

–– Some research suggests that taking a specific product of inositol nicotinate

(Hexopal) by mouth for several weeks modestly improves symptoms of
Raynaud’s syndrome [43, 45].

- **Precautions/Side Effects:**

–– Inositol nicotinate is generally safe for most people. However, it can cause

adverse effects such as stomach upset, intestinal gas, and nausea [43].

- **Evidence for and Against:**

–– According to a systematic review in 2008, certain drug treatments, such as

nicardipine, inositol nicotinate, and prazosin may successfully treat primary
Raynaud’s phenomenon, but there are no large studies available to effectively
draw these conclusions [46].

- **Dosage:**

–– General Dosing: Some supplements may not list inositol nicotinate sepa­

rately. Instead it may be listed as niacin. Niacin is measured in niacin equiva­
lents (NE). 1 mg of inositol nicotinate equals 1 mg NE [43].
–– Raynaud’s Phenomenon: Up to 4 g daily of inositol nicotinate can be used;

however, it might take several weeks before effects are seen [43].

- **Interactions:**

–– Long-term use of inositol nicotinate can increase blood glucose and may

decrease effectiveness of hypoglycemic medications [43].
–– Inositol nicotinate may have potential action in anticoagulation. When cou­

pled with other anticoagulation medication, the chance for bleeding and
bruising may increase [43].
–– Inositol nicotinate is converted to niacin within the body. The use of statins

and niacin together may increase the risk of muscle problems (e.g., myosi­
tis) [43].


-----

3 Hawthorn–Lysine


79


–– When Inositol nicotinate converted to niacin, flushing and dizziness can

occur. Nicotine patches can also cause flushing and dizziness. The use of both
medications can worse potential side effects [43].
###### **Ipriflavone**

- **What Is It?**

–– Ipriflavone is a synthetic isoflavone, used to prevent bone resorption, maintain

bone density, and manage osteoporosis [47, 48].

- **How Does It Work in the Body?**

–– Ipriflavone works by inhibiting calcium-dependent protease throughout the

body [49].

- **What Is It Used for?**

–– There is evidence that ipriflavone (in conjunction with estrogen and/or cal­

cium) may strengthen bones in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis

[47, 48, 50].

- **Precautions/Side Effects:**

–– Per a systematic review by Hu et al., mild gastrointestinal symptoms were

noted. Additionally, a mild decrease in lymphocyte count was observed but
resolved with discontinuation of ipriflavone [51].

- **Evidence for and Against:**

–– According to Hu et al., ipriflavone significantly increases bone mineral den­

sity and has inhibitory effects on bone resorption markers in postmenopausal
women with osteopenia or osteoporosis [51].
–– Several studies have shown that genistein and ipriflavone have beneficial

effects on bone density and are safe in postmenopausal women. This may be
considered as a complementary or alternative option in the prevention and
treatment of menopause-related osteoporosis [52].

- **Dosage:**

–– Osteoporosis: 200 mg of ipriflavone by mouth, three times daily.
–– Paget disease: 600–1200 mg of ipriflavone by mouth, daily.

- **Interactions:**

–– Ipriflavone is contraindicated in individuals with an existing history of hyper­

sensitivity to any of its ingredients (Ipriflavone, Hypromellose, Leucine, or
Magnesium Citrate) [49].

###### **Iodine**

- **What Is It?**


E. Jain et al.


–– Iodine is a mineral found in some foods. It is critical for the formation of

thyroid hormone [53].

- **How Does It Work in the Body?**

–– Iodine is not readily made in the human body and must be obtained through

diet. Iodine in the blood is transported into the follicular cell along with
sodium by a sodium-iodine symporter pump. Once in follicular cells, it binds
with tyrosine and thyroglobulin and later iodized and coupled to form thyroid
hormone [54].

- **What Is It Used for?**

–– Taking iodine supplements by mouth, including iodized salt, is effective for

preventing and treating iodine deficiency, treating an overactive thyroid gland,
and/or preventing thyroid cancer secondary to radiation [55, 56].

- **Precautions/Side Effects:**

–– High levels of iodine can cause some of the same symptoms as iodine defi­

ciency, including goiter (an enlarged thyroid gland) [53].
–– High iodine intakes can also cause thyroid gland inflammation and thyroid

cancer [53].
–– Getting a very large dose of iodine (e.g., several grams) can cause burning of

the mouth, throat, and stomach; fever; stomach pain; nausea; vomiting; diar­
rhea; weak pulse; and coma [53].

- **Evidence for and Against:**

–– There is insufficient evidence to support current recommendations for iodine

supplementation in pregnancy in areas of mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency.
Well-designed randomized control trials, with child cognitive outcomes, are
needed in pregnant women who are moderately deficient in iodine [57].
–– Thyroid hormone receptors have been identified and characterized in placen­

tal and embryonic tissues, allowing us to elucidate the maternal-fetal transfer
of thyroid hormones. Experimental studies have demonstrated that the archi­
tecture of the cerebral cortex can be irreversibly disturbed in iodine deficiency
causing abnormal neuron migratory patterns associated with cognitive impair­
ment in children [58].

- **Dosage:**

–– The amount of iodine you need each day depends on your age. Average daily

recommended amounts are listed below in micrograms (mcg) [53].

- **Interactions:**


81


–– Iodine supplements might interact with anti-thyroid medications such as

methimazole, used to treat hyperthyroidism. The two medications combined
may potentiate hypothyroid effects [53].
–– Taking potassium iodide with medicines for high blood pressure (e.g., ACE

inhibitors) or with potassium-sparing diuretics could raise the amount of
potassium in your blood to an unsafe level [53].
###### **Iron**

- **What Is It?**

–– Iron is a mineral and an essential component of hemoglobin. It is naturally

present in many foods, added to some food products, and available as a dietary
supplement [59].

- **How Does It Work in the Body?**

–– Iron is a crucial component of heme synthesis. The iron in the blood is trans­

ported to the mitochondria and inserted into heme precursor, protoporphyrin
IX, via the enzyme ferrochelatase. This produces heme [60].

- **What Is It Used for?**

–– Iron is a key building block for hemoglobin formation. Its primary purpose is

to prevent anemia. Hemoglobin resides on red blood cells, a mineral in the
human body, is one of the components of hemoglobin, the substance in red
blood cells that helps blood carry oxygen throughout the body. If you do not
have enough iron, your body cannot make hemoglobin and you may develop
anemia [59–61].

- **Precautions/Side Effects:**


-----

82 E. Jain et al.

–– Iron is generally safe with doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL)

of 45 mg elemental iron daily [61].
–– High doses of iron can cause gastrointestinal issues including upset stomach,

nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting; however, taking iron supplements with food
seems to reduce side effects [59, 61].
–– Iron is likely unsafe when taken in excessive doses. Acute intakes of more

than 20 mg/kg iron (about 1365 mg iron for a person weighing 150 lb) from
supplements or medicines can lead to corrosive necrosis of the intestine,
which might lead to fluid and blood loss, shock, tissue damage, and organ
failure, especially if food is not taken at the same time as the iron [59, 61].

- **Evidence for and Against:**

–– Recent evidence indicates that low doses of iron sulfate are more effective and

better tolerated than the traditionally recommended dose (100–200 mg
daily) [62].
–– Studies now suggest switching from daily to alternate-day schedules and from

divided to morning single doses increases iron absorption and may reduce
side effects. Providing morning doses of 60–120 mg iron as a ferrous salt
given with ascorbic acid on alternate days may be an optimal oral dosing regi­
men for women with iron-deficiency and mild IDA [63].

- **Dosage:**

–– The amount of iron needed daily depends on your age. Average daily recom­

mended amounts of iron for non-vegetarians are listed below [59].

–– The recommended daily allowance for vegetarians is 1.8 times higher than

individuals who eat meat because iron is more bioavailable in meat compared
to plants [59].

- **Interactions:**

–– Evidence exists that indicates that iron supplements may reduce the absorp­

tion of levodopa, thus, diminish its clinical effectiveness [59].

83


–– Simultaneous ingestion of iron and levothyroxine can result in significant

reductions in levothyroxine efficacy [59, 64].
–– Proton pump inhibitors reduce the acidity of stomach contents and thus, can

reduce iron absorption [59].
###### **Java Tea**

- **What Is It?**

–– Java Tea ( *Orthosiphon stamineus* ) is a medicinal herb predominantly found in

Southeast Asia and Africa.

- **How Does It Work in the Body, Usage, and Evidence?**

–– A study form Yuliana et al. has been shown that Java Tea antagonizes the

adenosine A1 receptors which induces diuresis and natriuresis which regu­
lates urine flow rate and absolute excretion of sodium [65, 66].
–– A study from Zhong et al. (2010) showed that Java Tea can increase urinary

calcium and oxalate excretion thus reducing the synthesis of calcium-based
kidney stones [65, 67].
–– Yam et al. (2009) studied *Orthosiphon stamineus* and noted a marked histo­

logical improvement in the healing of mucosal damage in the GI tract. This is
based off its ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation and stimulate gastric secre­
tion [65, 68].

- **Dosage:**

–– A study from Yam et al. (2007) analyzed effects of Java Tea for liver protec­

tion by monitoring ALT and AST levels which showed good results. Study
suggests Java Tea was found effective at doses higher than 250 mg/kg [65, 67].
–– Further studies must be done to know the correct therapeutic dosage [65].

- **Adverse Effects:**

–– Patients that are on a hypertensive therapy when taking *Orthosiphon stamin­*

*eus* should be monitored for an orthostatic hypotensive attack [65].

- **Interactions:**

–– Should not be taken with other diuretics because the combination and lead to

possible hypertension and congestive heart failure. Adam et al. (2009) noted
that a combination of *Orthosiphon stamineus* and antidiabetic drugs can cause
hypoglycemia [65, 69].

used to make medicine but also as known to have hallucinogenic affects if
taken inappropriately [70].
–– Scientific name goes by *Datura stramonium* [71].

- **How Does It Work in the Body?**

–– The leaves that are used contain antispasmodic properties that help with the

treatment of asthma [70].
–– Jimson weed contains chemicals such as atropine, hyoscyamine and scopol­

amine that interfere with the acetylcholine in the brain and nerves [70].

- **What It Is Used for?**

–– Jimson weed can be used to make medicine and have been used to treat

asthma, diarrhea, intestinal cramps, and nocturia due to its anticholinergic
affects [70].

- **What Dosage?**

–– Dosages exceeding 10 mg is considered potentially lethal. The seeds can con­

tain approximately 6 mg of atropine [70, 72].
–– Further studies are needed to have a set dosage on what is considered safe for

medicinal purposes.

- **Evidence for or Against Its Different Uses:**

–– A study was done to show the benefits of Jimson weed for asthma in pregnant

patients along with potential adverse effects to the fetus [73].

Stated that the antimuscarinic effects of Jimson weed lead to the continu­

ous bronchodilation to help with asthma but the release on acetylcholine
can be harmful to the fetus [73].

- **Safety Concerns, Side Effects, and Precautions:**

–– Exposure to the fetus while a pregnant woman using Jimson weed comes

from the continuous release of acetylcholine which can result in permanent
damage to fetus [73].

Should be used with caution during pregnancy [70, 73].

–– Acute Jimson weed poison is seen due to potential hallucinogen affects.

Symptoms include dry mouth, extreme thirst, dry skin, pupil dilation,
impaired vision, urinary retention, rapid heartbeat, confusion, restlessness,
and loss of consciousness [70].

Due to inhibition of central and peripheral muscarinic neurotransmis­
sion [70].

- **Interactions with Medications:**

–– Further studies have been shown in terms of interactions on Jimson weed and

other medications [70].
–– However, toxicology reports are used due to lethal cases of Jimson weed

ingestions in polysubstance abuse [70].

Those drugs including Alcohol, Marijuana, or Cocaine.
###### **Jojoba**

- **What Is It?**

–– Medicinal plan that is created into an oil [74].
–– Comes from the *Simmondsia chinensis* plant that is found commonly in North

and Central American desserts and has been known to be cultivated in Egypt,
Chile, and Argentina [74].

–– It works on the body with its antioxidant properties, anti-acne, anti-psoriasis,

anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, analgesic, antimicrobial and anti-­
hyperglycemia [74].
–– Its mechanisms of action will be discussed in the next section in greater

detail [74].

- What **It Is Used for?**

–– Anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties.

Habashy et al. conducting a study in 2005 that demonstrated reduction of
edema and Prostaglandin E2 (a lipid compound that is the one of the main
components of inflammation) in a rat study [74, 75].

     - Supports that jojoba oil is involved in the blockage of both COX2, also

known as cyclooxygenase II and lipoxygenase which leads to blocking
inflammation [74, 76].

     - This study was further confirmed with a study involving the results of

jojoba liquid wax and the treatment of diaper rashes, also known as a
napkin rash. [74, 75].

–– The study involved the jojoba wax and the combination of triam­

cinolone acetonide, nystatin, neomycin, and gramicidin [74, 75].
–– Shown that the liquid wax was just as effective as the combination

listed above and jojoba was known to have fewer side effects [74, 75].


-----

86


E. Jain et al.


–– Anti-acne

Jojoba oil’s properties as a liquid wax allow the dissolution of sebum
deposits within hair follicles due to an ability to penetrate the follicles and
remove the comedone which ends up clearing the skin [75, 77].
One study done by A.R. Baldwin was shown that the anti-psoriasis activity
of jojoba oil is related to the keratoplastic and keratolytic effect required to
treat excessive scaling of the skin [78].

–– Antimicrobial

A study done by Ranzato et al. (2011) showed that the liquid wax property
of jojoba has been shown to break down the solid wax coating of bacilli
which along with the combination of antibiotics can treat Tubercle bacilli,
leprosy bacilli, and brucelli [79].
Alcoholic extracts of jojoba have been shown to be effective against
*Bacillus cereus*, *Salmonella typhimurium*, and *Candida albicans* [79, 80].

     - The alkaloid, saponin, and steroid component of the jojoba root extract

is believed to be the cause of activity of the pathogens listed above

[79, 80].

- **Dosage:**

–– No known dosage as jojoba is not taken orally [74].

- **Adverse Effects:**

–– No studies have been shown to prove any adverse side effects of jojoba [74].

- **Interactions:**

–– No studies have been shown to prove any significant medication interactions

with jojoba oil [74].

87


A study was done by Manvi to show that Juniper was associated with
decreased levels of serum SGOT (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transami­
nase), SGPT (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase), total bilirubin, and
alkaline phosphate after they were initially increased by CCL4 infusion in
rats for 9 days [81, 82].
Decreased levels of SGPT, SGOT, ALP, and bilirubin shows protection to
hepatic cells [81, 82].

–– Antioxidants

Antioxidant properties were confirmed by in vivo study and created the
possibility of blocking the oxidation processes in yeast cells by increasing
the activity of the antioxidant enzymes [81, 83].

–– Antidiabetic and antihyperlipidemic

The methanolic extract of Juniper lead to significant reduction in blood
glucose levels and increased HDL levels in diabetic rats [81, 84].

     - Compared to group that was just given glibenclamide.

–– Analgesic activity

A study was done with the methanolic extract of Juniper.

     - Showed that methanolic extract of Juniper acted peripherally and cen­

trally for the antinociceptive activity [81, 85].

–– Antibacterial

The leaf extract was shown to be effective to pathogenic multidrug-­
resistant *Erwinia chrysanthemi, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis,*
*Agrobacterium tumefaciens,* and *Xanthomonas phaseoli* [81, 86].
The methanolic extract of *J. communis* was found to be very effective as
compared to standard antibiotics such as ampicillin 10 mcg and erythro­
mycin 15 mcg [81, 86].

- **Dosage:**

–– No studies have been shown the optimal dosage as experiments and studies

showed varying dosages [81].

-----

88


E. Jain et al.

–– No studies have shown that Juniper interacts with other medications, but this

does not mean it is not possible. Further investigation is needed to prove or
disprove any effects when interacting with other notifications [81].

###### **Kratom**

- **What Is It?**

–– Kratom or Mitragyna is a tropical plant indigenous to southeast Asia and is

consumed by preparing the leaves into a tea or grinding them into a powdery
substance [88].

- **How Does It Work in the Body, Usage, and Evidence?**

–– Kratom has similar effects of opioids including pain relief and euphoria which

can cause potential addiction effects.
–– Binds to the mu-opioid receptors just like other opioids with similar binding

affinity.

Suggests why Kratom has the effects of regulating pain perception.

–– Low dose of Kratom has been shown to be a mood booster and higher doses

shown to relieve anxiety.
–– Most common use of Kratom is pain relief specifically back/spine pain, fibro­

myalgia, migraine, rheumatoid arthritis.
–– Study showed that Kratom can be used as opioids substitution.

E.g., Coffee drinkers subbing this can improve social connection.

- **Dosage:**

–– Doses of 5 g of raw material are reported to exert stimulant effects [88].
–– Doses between 5 and 15 g are reported to lead to relaxation and analgesic

effects [88].

Higher doses reported to have more chances of more side effects.

–– Effects of Kratom are generally reported 5–7 h after use and optimal effects

are felt within 2–4 h [88].

- **Adverse Effects:**

–– Most common side effects.

Constipation [88, 90].
Nausea [88, 90].
Vomiting [88, 90].
Stomach irritation [88, 90].

3 Hawthorn–Lysine 89

Dizziness [88, 91].
Sedation [88, 91].
Liver problems [88, 91].
Seizure [88, 91].

–– Biggest concern of Kratom is its potential for dependence and addiction in

humans which have raised big concerns regarding its usage.
–– A proposal that was made stated that a large amount of Kratom use can be

used as an alternative for more harmful substances such as narcotics [89].

There is convincing evidence that shows Kratom has less potential for
addiction and overdose than original opioids [89].
Little evidence showing that Kratom is a good substitute with the same
traditional effects [89].

–– Due to Kratom being an unregulated supplement, it can have numerous risks.

Reported documentation of Kratom being mixed with synthetic substances
such as phenylethylamine which has resulted in death [89].
In 2018, there has been epidemiology and laboratory proof that Kratom
was the source of a multi-state salmonella outbreak [89].

–– Kratom mixed with other illicit substances has been linked to several organ

system injuries such as

Kidney injury [88, 92].

     - Acute kidney injury [88, 92].

Cardiotoxicity [88, 93].

    - Arrhythmias [88, 93].

Thyroid [88, 94].
Respiratory [88, 95].
Reproductive [88, 96].

    - Neonatal abstinence syndrome [88, 96, 97].

Hepatic (most common) [88, 98].

     - Elevated alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin [88, 98].

Neurologic [88, 99].

     - Acute brain injury, seizure, cognitive impairment [88, 99].

–– Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has shown that in 2016 and 2017

that Kratom was linked to 152 deaths [89].
–– Important to know that Kratom does have some therapeutic effects but can

quickly cause harmful effects if not used correctly or mixed with other sub­
stances of abuse [89].


-----

- **Interactions with Medications:**


E. Jain et al.


–– Kratom should be cautioned if consumed with alcohol or opioids [88].

Especially with benzodiazepines which can cause respiratory depres­
sion [88].
Combine with stimulants because Kratom as stimulant effects as well [88].

–– A study shows that Kratom has Cytochrome P450 enzyme activity [88, 100].

Increases the likelihood of herb–drug interaction with drugs that also are
associated with Cytochrome P450 activity [88, 100].

–– A study shows that the alkaloid portion of Kratom is an agonist from Alpha 2

adrenergic receptors [88, 101].

This can result to accentuation and can lead to more dangerous side effects
if mixed with sedative, hypnotic, and analgesic drugs [88, 101].

–– An in vitro study showed that Kratom mixed with erythromycin, loperamide,

and protease inhibitors can lead to Kratom toxicity [88, 102].
###### **Kava Kava**

- **What Is It?**

–– Kava is a type of perennial shrub that belongs to the pepper family known as

Piperaceae [103].

Melanesia [103].
Consumed in its traditional form as a drink [103].

- **How Does It Work in the Body, Usage, and Evidence?**

–– Known for its effects as a pain reliever, muscle relaxant and anxiety remedy,

nervousness, insomnia, and anti-inflammatory [103].

The mechanisms of Kava Kava that cause these effects require further
exploration and validation [103].

–– Anti-inflammatory.

Kava Kava has been studied and shown to have anti-inflammatory pro­
cesses by inhibiting TNF-Alpha secretion [103, 104].

–– Anxiolytic.

Kava Kava has been shown to be used to treat generalized anxiety disor­
der [103].

Number of studies have shown that Kava Kava can be an alternative to

benzodiazepines and selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors for patients
that have been diagnosed with mild-to-moderate anxiety [103].

–– Other benefits

Kava Kava had a study done to show that it can be used to treat epilepsy

[103, 105].
Studies by Stein showed that Kava Kava can reduce cravings for people
with substance abuse [103, 106].

    - Substances including

–– Alcohol [103, 106].
–– Tobacco [103, 106].
–– Cocaine [103, 106].
–– Heroin [103, 106].

Kava has been shown to have benefits in recognition memory tasks and
enhanced accuracy and performance in visual attention and working mem­
ory task [103, 107].
Kava has been noted to improve sleep but warrants future research to prove
theory [103].

- **Dosage:**

–– The recommended daily dose for an adult is typically one to three capsules

with a daily dose of 60–250 mg for 1–2 months to notice effects [103].
–– Clinical trials have shown that Kava was efficacious within the daily dose

range of 20–300 mg Kavalactones for mild-and-moderate anxiety [103].

- **Adverse Effects:**

–– Reports showing that four separate instances that drivers in Iowa where unable

to operate a vehicle due to sedative effects, but the amount of Kava taken was
unknown [103].
–– Reported cases of liver issues [103].

Elevated AST, ALT, ALP, LDH, and Bilirubin [103].

- **Interactions with Medications:**

–– No known interaction with other medications has been found but that does not

mean they do not exist [103].
–– Further investigation is needed [103].
###### **Khella Baldi**

- **What Is It?**


-----

92 E. Jain et al.

–– Also known as Ammi Visnaga [108].
–– An herb indigenous to the Mediterranean region of the North Africa, Asia,

and Europe [108].

- **How Does It Work in the Body, Usage, and Evidence?**

–– It has been known to treat renal colic and coronary insufficiency [108].
–– Its flavonoid content is the main ingredient for its antioxidant properties [108].
–– Studies have shown its use in the treatment of mild obstruction of the respira­

tory tract in asthma or spastic bronchitis and post op removal of kidney
stones [108].
–– It has also been used to dilate bronchial, urinary, and blood vessels without

affecting blood pressure [108].
–– Infusion of the aerial parts have been used to treat headaches [108].
–– In its use in kidney disorders, it is commonly coupled with Khellin and

Visnagin which are major properties of Khella Baldi [108].

These have been shown to prevent renal epithelial cell damage caused by
oxalate and calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals. It achieves this through
increasing urinary pH and citrate concentration thus preventing oxalate
formation [108–113].

–– In antispasmodic and vasodilating effects.

Contains properties that inhibits the contractile responses that mediate by
Ca entry through L-type Ca channels and at high concentrations along with
interfering with other sites involved with vascular smooth muscle contrac­
tion [108, 115–120].
Can treat angina pectoris due to peripheral and coronary vasodilator
according to several research studies [108, 114].
Vasodilating effects are attributed to Khellin and Visnadin which have cal­
cium antagonistic properties [108, 114].

     - Calcium is used for vasoconstriction.

–– Hair loss.

In a study, topical Khella Baldi has been used to increase in arterial and
arteriolar activity which increased microcirculatory flow [108, 121].

     - Leading to less hair loss [108, 121].

- **Dosage:**

–– Daily recommended doses range from 0.05 to 0.15 g [108].

- **Adverse Effects:**

–– Advised to be avoided during pregnancy [108].
–– Also advised that people receiving Khella treatment are not exposed to direct

sunlight [108].

–– No studies have shown any adverse effects with Khella but more studies have

to be done in order to make this conclusion [108].
###### **Lecithin**

- **What Is It and How Does It Work in the Body?**

–– Lecithin is a mixture comprised of choline, choline esters, fatty acids, glyc­

erol, glycolipids, triglycerides, phosphoric acid, and phospholipids. It is a
compound that is found in animals and vegetables. Some examples include
red meat, eggs, peanuts, and oranges. In the body, it was found that lecithin,
specifically in athletes can help reduce choline levels in the plasma that
increase during physical stress [122]. There is also some evidence that it can
help in certain conditions due to its properties of phosphatidylcholine and
lipids although its exact mechanism is not yet fully understood. For example,
in CNS disorders, phosphatidylcholine is a precursor for acetylcholine and
higher levels can result in improved memory [123].

- **What Is It Used for and at What Dosage?**

–– Lecithin can be used for athletic performance, CNS disorders, contact lenses,

diabetes, GI conditions, lactation, menopause, and muscle atrophy. In patients
with bipolar disorder, a dose of 10 mg three times daily was seen to decrease
hallucinations, delusions, and improved speech [124]. In memory disorders,
studies have been performed to measure if high doses of 20–25 g per day of
lecithin result in better outcomes in memory disorders [125]. In neurologic
disorders with acetylcholine deficiency, studies have been performed with
doses from 25 g per day to 50–60 g per day [126].

- **Evidence for or Against Its Different Uses (Broken Down by Evidence for**

**Each Use):**

–– For Alzheimer patients, it was found that there may be a window in which

lecithin can help [125], however in a multicenter study, where tacrine and
lecithin were used, there was no improvement in mental status [127]. In one
study, ten patients with Friedrich ataxia improved [128]. However, in a
Cochrane review, there was no difference between placebo and lecithin in
management of antipsychotic induced tardive dyskinesia [129]. In contact
lenses, there was a study done to evaluate the effects of ocular lipid-based
supplements on ocular comfort. There was no correlation between ocular
comfort and lipid layers [129]. In a study looking at the dietary intake of phos­
phatidylcholine on type 2 diabetes, there was an associated lower risk of type
II diabetes development in men [130]. Lecithin has anti-inflammatory and
antioxidant properties as it can function as a protective component of colonic

mucus that can increase the intestinal hydrophobic barrier. This is essential in
ulcerative colitis patients who have a loss in intestinal integrity. There is very
limited evidence in lecithin uses for hypercholesterolemia, lactation, liver dis­
ease, menopause, and muscle atrophy. However, there is some evidence to
show that supplementing lecithin can influence bile secretion and decrease
cardiovascular risk [131].

- **Safety Concerns, Side Effects, and Precautions:**

–– Generally, there are not many safety concerns with lecithin when used in

moderation. However, in large doses of more than 25 g/day, there are short-­
term side effects of gastrointestinal stress, sweating, salivation, or
anorexia [132].

- **Interactions with Medications:**

–– Interactions are not well studied or documented yet in the literature.
###### **Licorice**

- **What Is It and How Does It Work in the Body?**

–– Licorice, or *Glycyrrhiza glabra*, is comprised of triterpenoids, polyphenols,

and polysaccharides. It works in the body through its anti-inflammatory and
antiviral effects. Some studies have found that in animal studies, components
of licorice can clear immune complexes thus decreasing inflammation [133].
In terms of antiviral properties, licorice is used to inhibit the virus from bind­
ing to the host membrane and replicating. Some studies have observed
licorice-­induced interferon production through T-cells [134].

- **What Is It Used for and at What Dosage?**

–– Licorice can be used for cardiac use, diabetes, and endocrine uses. For cardiac

use, effects are seen at 50–200 g/day [135].
–– Licorice extract syrup was used in patients with Parkinson’s Disease at a dose

of 136 mg twice daily [136]. In some women, licorice has been used in con­
junction with spironolactone in the treatment of polycystic ovarian syndrome

[137]. For ulcer gastritis, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, licorice root has
been used at a dose of 760 mg to 15 g [138].

- **Evidence for or Against Its Different Uses (Broken Down by Evidence for**

**Each Use):**

–– For blood pressure, licorice has been seen to increase blood pressure without

changes in heart rate [135]. It was observed that of the 30 of the 39 patients
that completed the trial of patients with Parkinson’s Disease there was signifi­
cant improvement of total disease, motor, daily activities, tremor, and rigidity

[136]. For hot flashes, patients taking 1140 mg/day noted a significant
­reduction in hot flashes [139]. For metabolic effects, licorice has been shown
to reduce weight [135].

- **Safety Concerns, Side Effects, and Precautions:**

–– When licorice is consumed at normal consumption levels, few side effects are

observed. For example, if consumed in large doses, can cause hypertension.
At high doses, vasospasm of the optic nerve blood vessels has been observed

[140]. Hypersensitivity reactions have been noted as well [134]. Licorice can
also have effect of exacerbating heart failure and should be used with caution
in patients on anticoagulation [141].

- **Interactions with Medications:**

–– Licorice has several interactions with other medications where it can increase

the toxic effects of certain agents. For example, licorice can enhance the
effects of anticoagulants and increase bleeding. Bleeding can also occur with
some NSAIDs and salicylates [142]. Licorice can also increase the effect of
loop and thiazide diuretics [143].
###### **Lingonberry**

- **What Is It and How Does It Work in the Body?**

–– Lingonberry is from the berry family and it is found in Central Europe, Russia,

and Canada. Lingonberry is classified as a “superfruit” as it is rich in antioxi­
dants and polyphenols. In terms of how it works in the body, the lingonberry
can decrease oxidants in the body, induce cell apoptosis and cancer cell pro­
liferation, decrease cytokines, and decrease markers of inflammation [144].

- **What Is It Used for and at What Dosage?**

–– Lingonberry is used for its antioxidant properties, anticancer activity, neuro­

protection, anti-obesity, and anti-inflammatory properties. For antioxidant
benefit, studies have shown that fresh and dried lingonberry consumed
throughout the whole year can significantly reduce oxidants. One study found
that dried lingonberry has greater antioxidant ability than its fresh counterpart

[145]. At different doses, lingonberry can have different uses. At small doses
of 1–5 mg/mL, lingonberry can decrease oxidative stress and increase adipo­
nectin [144]. At medium doses of freeze-dried lingonberry for 13 weeks, for
example, it can decrease body fat and hepatic lipid and ALT levels [146]. In
terms of neuroprotection, lingonberry extract of 1 mL can protect cells from
injury [147].

96 E. Jain et al.

–– In its main use as an antioxidant, several studies have been performed to mea­

sure this. Drozdz et al. found that blueberries exhibited higher antioxidant
activity.
–– However, the authors concluded that both would be a good source of supple­

mentation [145]. In animal models, it has been found that lingonberries can
reduce tumor number and size [148]. It has been seen however, consumption
of the lingonberry is more helpful if consumed for longer as part of a lifestyle
instead of for a limited time [144].

- **Safety Concerns, Side Effects, and Precautions:**

–– Studies on Lingonberry have not been performed on pregnant individuals and

thus should be avoided. Due to high tannins, lingonberry may cause nausea
and vomiting in some individuals [149].

- **Interactions with Medications:**

–– Currently, there is no evidence of studies performed on interactions with other

medications.
###### **Liverwort**

- **What Is It and How Does It Work in the Body?**

–– Liverwort is also known as agrimony and works in the body through a hepa­

toprotective and antioxidant mechanism. In terms of hepatoprotection, it is
shown in animal data to increase levels of a TLR4 receptor and protein expres­
sion to induce nitric oxide synthase and COX2. As a result, it is likely able to
suppress oxidative stress [150]. In a clinical trial performed in Korea, 80
adults with elevated ALT levels were given liverwort extract. Compared to
placebo, those adults had reduction in their ALT levels [151]. In a clinical trial
with 19 volunteers where liverwort was added to hot tea, there was significant
elevation of plasma total antioxidant capacity [152].

- **What Is It Used for and at What Dosage?**

–– In terms of use, it is used for flavoring and a soothing tea for performers and

speakers. Although it has been clinically investigated in small groups, there is
no indication yet for liverwort. Dosing of liverwort is about 200 mL of boiled
water with 1 g of dried liverwort. This should be consumed twice a day for
about 1 month [152].

- **Evidence for or Against Its Different Uses (Broken Down by Evidence for**

**Each Use):**

–– In terms of uses, liverwort can be used for analgesia, infection, antioxidant,

cancer, cardioprotective, diabetes, and hepatoprotection. In animal models,


-----

liverwort extract was seen to improve analgesia as effectively as gabapentin

[153]. In the use of fighting infection, in animal models, liverwort extract was
able to show antibacterial activity against *E. coli* [154] as well as antiviral
activity as it interfered with viral entry into the cell [155]. For the use of anti­
oxidant and cancer use, there is some clinical data to suggest that liverwort
can increase the antioxidant level in the body [152]. In terms of cardiac pro­
tection, in animal models, it has been seen that liverwort can prolong clotting
time [156]. In terms of diabetes, liverwort was studied in animal models
showed significant improvement in insulin levels and insulin resistance after
16 weeks [157]. Lastly, in terms of hepatoprotection, liverwort was seen to
reduce ALT levels [151].

- **Safety Concerns, Side Effects, and Precautions:**

–– There have been reports that liverwort can produce photodermatitis [158].

- **Interactions with Medications:**

–– Interactions are not well documented yet in the literature.
###### **Lobelia Inflata**

- **What Is It and How Does It Work in the Body?**

–– *Lobelia inflata* is a plant that grows in Canada and the northern United States.

In the body, it is used for tobacco cessation. In terms of mechanism, lobeline
has affinity to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors [159].

- **What Is It Used for and at What Dosage?**

–– *Lobelia inflata* has been used for smoking cessation, asthma, and bronchitis.

In terms of dosage, it has been administered as an expectorant from 100 mg
of dry herb up to three times a day. In history, lobelia was used like tobacco
leaves and was smoked for respiratory illnesses. It was also used for nausea
and emesis [160]. In 1993, it was banned over the counter for smoking cessa­
tion by the FDA [161].

- **Evidence for or Against Its Different Uses (Broken Down by evidence for**

**Each Use):**

–– There is clinical data for the use of Lobelia for tobacco cessation, CNS effects,

and respiratory effects. For tobacco cessation, results have been controversial
as some studies have shown lobeline to be effective, but a meta-analysis found
that all previous studies could not adequately prove this [162]. Thus, the FDA
removed lobeline products from its list. In terms of CNS effects, a study was
performed measuring the effect of lobeline, methylphenidate, and placebo on
cohort of individuals with ADHD. It found that there was no difference with


-----

98 E. Jain et al.

lobeline; however, the sample size was limited [163]. There is also some evi­
dence to show lobeline can be used for heroin abuse [164]. Lastly, in terms of
respiratory effects, positive effects were seen on pulmonary receptors using
bolus doses [165].

- **Safety Concerns, Side Effects, and Precautions:**

–– There is safety concern of the dosage of the supplement. A dose of 1 g of the

plant is toxic and 4 g of the plant is fatal [158].

- **Interactions with Medications:**

–– Interactions of lobelia with other medications or supplements are not well

documented.
###### **Lutein**

- **What Is It and How Does It Work in the Body?**

–– Lutein is a xanthophyll carotenoid that works as an antioxidant and blue light

filter. In the body, it functions to protect ocular tissues [166]. In animal stud­
ies, it inhibits monocyte-mediated inflammation and protects against macular
degeneration [167].

- **What Is It Used For and at What Dosage?**

–– In terms of use, although with limited data, lutein can potentially be used for

age-related macular degeneration and cataracts. There is possible use for can­
cer and cardiovascular health. For dosing, 5 mg daily or 10–20 mg daily for
3–6 months has been studied in clinical trials [168].

- **Evidence for or Against Its Different Uses (broken down by evidence for**

**Each Use):**

–– In terms of use, lutein can be used for eye health and cancer. One study per­

formed in China observed 121 patients who supplemented their diet with
20 mg per day of lutein. It found that there was significant improvement in the
central macular pigment optical density [169]. In a meta-analysis of six stud­
ies, researchers found a significant correlation of lutein reducing the risk of
early age-related macular degeneration [168]. Evidence also shows some
association between lutein and age-related cataracts; however, the results are
mixed. For example, one meta-analysis shows lutein significantly reduced the
risk of cataracts [170]. This contrasts with another meta-analysis which found
that lutein and zeaxanthin had a significant reduction in nuclear cataracts but
not cortical or subscapular [171]. There was no difference found between
lutein supplementation and retinitis pigmentosa [172]. Likewise, there was no


-----

99


correlation between lutein and its protection of retinopathy of prematurity

[173]. There is still limited to no clinical trials of lutein and cancer.

- **Safety Concerns, Side Effects, and Precautions:**

–– Generally, there are no safety concerns of lutein in the body.

- **Interactions with Medications** :

–– There are no studied interactions with medications. However, beta-carotene

and lutein may compete for absorption and cause lower levels of lutein [174].
###### **Lysine**

- **What Is It and How Does It Work in the Body?**

–– Lysine is an amino acid that is found in fish, eggs, meat, and legumes. Lysine

in the body works to antagonize herpes simplex virus growth [175]. It also
works to build collagen for bone growth. It can increase the growth of osteo­
blasts as well [176].

- **What Is It Used for and at What Dosage?**

–– Lysine is used for protein production. Its catabolism occurs in the liver and

then is transported to the muscle for use. Clinically, lysine has been shown to
prevent and treat herpes simplex virus. There is also some new evidence to
suggest lysin can aid in stress, hypertension, muscle strength, and diabetes.
For oral dosing, lysine is given from 3 to 6 g for up to 1 year [175].

- **Evidence for or Against Its Different Uses (Broken Down by Evidence for**

**Each Use):**

–– Lysine has been used in several studies for the treatment of herpes infections

or cold sores. In one study, patients were given 500 mg daily of lysine for
prevention and 1000 mg every 6 h upon prodrome development. In this study,
only 1 out of 28 subjects did not see a benefit [177]. However, there are con­
trasting studies which show no benefit. For example, in a study of 31 patients
with herpes simplex, there was no reduction of episodes with 750 mg daily of
lysine [178].

- **Safety Concerns, Side Effects, and Precautions:**

–– Possible side effects of lysine include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and acid

reflux [179]. Very high doses are thought to be safe in patients due to fast
activation of its use in the liver [180]. However, due to interactions with other
medications or in patients with poor blood circulation, lysine may have a
nephrotoxic effect [181]. Thus, lysine should be used with caution in patients
with ischemia or preexisting renal disease [178].

- **Interactions with Medications:**


E. Jain et al.


–– Lysine is seen to interact with calcium supplements and aminoglycosides.

Calcium with lysine supplementation can result in increased calcium absorp­
tion and decrease of calcium elimination. Aminoglycosides may increase tox­
icity of lysine [182].

##### **Chapter 4**
#### **Maca–Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6)**

**Alana Weisstuch**
###### **Maca**

- **What is it?**

–– Maca is a herbaceous plant [1].

- **How does it work in the body?**

–– Some studies have shown that maca has a hormonal effect on post-­menopausal

women and healthy adult males [2, 3]. When taken, maca can stimulate lutein­
izing hormone, inhibit the production of follicle-stimulating hormone, and
allow for the production of androgen. This process can in turn, improve sexual
function [1].

- **What is it used for?**

–– While more research is needed, maca can be used to improve stamina and

sexual functioning in post-menopausal women. Further research is still
needed for the claims of treating infertility [1].

- **Precautions/side effects:**

–– Maca should not be used in those with hormone-sensitive cancers. Side effects

can include disruption in menstrual cycles, mood, sleep, and GI upset [1].

- **Evidence for and against:**

A. Weisstuch


–– One systematic review by Shin et al. concluded that more research is needed

to determine the exact effectiveness of maca on the improvement of sexual
function. Two of the randomized control trials studied did show a positive
significant effect on sexual dysfunction; however, two additional studies did
not show any clinically significant effect [1, 2].
–– A meta-analysis studied the effect of maca on sexual function. Of the studies,

three main groups of subjects were included: post-menopausal women,
healthy men, men with erectile dysfunction and a small group of male ath­
letes. It was concluded that the current data for supplementation of maca is
insufficient. Further research is needed to clinically support the prescription
of maca supplementation for sexual function [4].

- **Dosage:**

–– The recommended dosage of maca is pending more research. However, one

double blind randomized study showed a significant improvement in sexual
dysfunction when taking 3 g/day [2, 3].

- **Adverse effects:**

–– No comprehensive studies have shown definitive adverse side effects of maca

supplemention [1, 3].

- **Interactions:**

–– There are no known significant medication interactions with maca supple­

mentation [5].
###### **Magnesium**

- **What is it?**

–– Magnesium is a chemical element which has many different functions within

the body. Magnesium is a cofactor for more than 300 enzyme reactions [6].

- **What is it used for?**

–– Magnesium can be used to reduce asthma symptoms, help prevent cancer, and

improve CAD, DM, depression, fatigue, HTN, leg cramps, migraines, osteo­
porosis, and premenstrual syndrome [6].

- **How does it work in the body?**

–– Magnesium can help reduce mineral deposits into arteries. Magnesium can

increase the activity of TRPM7 receptors which can then increase the effect
of anticalcification proteins [6].

4 Maca–Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6)


113


–– Magnesium is an essential component for the conversion of Vitamin D to its

active form. This conversion allows for optimal calcium absorption, metabo­
lism, and normal parathyroid hormone function [6].
–– Magnesium can have an effect on blood pressure through its functions as a

calcium channel blocker by decreasing vascular resistance, and by changing
vascular tone and reactivity [6].
–– Magnesium can decrease the rigidness of arteries in those with CAD [6].
–– For those with diabetes, magnesium can act as a cofactor on the metabolism

of insulin and glucose [6].
–– Magnesium can act as an anti-inflammatory agent by controlling the activa­

tion of NF-kB activation and the production of cytokin [6].
–– Magnesium can be used as a laxative by its ability to absorb water in the intes­

tines [6].
–– Magnesium can play a role in cancer prevention through its role of maintain­

ing genetic stability, regulating cell proliferation, protecting against insulin
resistance, oxidative stress, and inflammation. On the contrary, low levels of
magnesium have been shown to inhibit the growth of tumors. Overall, more
research is needed.

- **Evidence for and against:**

–– Magnesium has been shown to have a positive effect on preventing osteopo­

rosis [7]. Supplementation was associated with decreased fractures and
increased bone density [7]. It is noted that exceedingly high and low levels
have shown to be harmful to bone health [7].
–– Magnesium may have a positive effect on depression or mood as it is essential

for the conversion of tryptophan to serotonin [7].
–– Magnesium can be used as a sleep aid, as it acts as an antagonist on NMDA

and inversely acts as an agonist on GABA [7].
–– One randomized double blind placebo controlled study showed magnesium

supplementation stimulates insulin production [8].
–– A case control study showed that those who had a diet rich in magnesium had

a lower likelihood of colorectal tumors [9].
–– Those who took magnesium for 1 year along with medical treatment for heart

failure had improved life expectancy and improvement in side effects [10].
–– A meta-analysis conducted in 2016 concluded that magnesium supplementa­

tion of 300 mg for 1 month may reduce blood pressure in those with hyperten­
sion, however, further research is needed [11].
–– A review conducted in 2002 studied pregnant women with leg cramps. Those

who supplemented magnesium had the best outcome of reduction in leg
cramps when compared to calcium, sodium chloride, or multivitamins [12].
–– Adults with low intake of magnesium may be at increased risk for asthma. A

randomized control trial showed improvement in asthma symptoms in those
supplemented with magnesium [13].
–– A systematic review by Whelan showed no significant improvement of PMS

symptoms with magnesium supplementation [14].


-----

114 A. Weisstuch

–– One double blind placebo controlled study showed that magnesium sulfate

supplementation had a positive effect on migraines [15].

- **Interactions with medications:**

–– When aminoglycosides are taken with magnesium, it can increase the risk of

causing neuromuscular weakness and/or paralysis [16].
–– Magnesium may reduce the ability of the body to properly absorb certain

types of antibiotics (quinolone, tetracycline, and nitrofurantoin). It is recom­
mended to leave at least an hour between medications [16].
–– Magnesium can cause dizziness, nausea, or fluid retention when taken with

calcium channel blockers [16].
–– Antacids contain magnesium hydroxide which can increase absorption of

medications used to regulate blood sugar [16].
–– Magnesium can hinder absorption of fluoroquinolones, when taken together.

Leaving at least 4 h between taking the two, can decrease the risk of poor
absorption [16].
–– When magnesium and labetalol are taken together, it could slow heart rate or

reduce heart function [16].
–– When magnesium and levomethadyl are taken together, there is risk for QT

prolongation [16].
–– Magnesium can hinder the absorption of these tiludronate and alendro­

nate [16].

- **Dosage:**

–– The RDAs for adult males and females are listed below [17]:

Males, 19–30 years of age: 400 mg daily.
Females, 19–30 years of age: 310 mg daily.
Males, 31 years of age and over: 420 mg daily.
Females, 31 years of age and over: 320 mg daily.

–– In various studies, the following dosages have been shown to be benefi­

cial [18]:

Relieving asthma symptoms (~350–450 mg).
Migraines (360–600 mg/day).
HTN (>480 mg/day).

- **Adverse reactions:**

–– Magnesium can cause GI distress (such as nausea or diarrhea), abdominal

pain, or bone pain [6].

- **Precautions/safety concern:**

–– Magnesium and calcium compete for absorption. When supplementing with

magnesium, it is important to check calcium levels in order to minimize risk
of calcium deficiency [16].

4 Maca–Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) 115
###### **Magnolia**

- **What is it?**

–– Magnolia is an herb, traditionally used in Chinese medicine. The flower and

the bark of the herb exhibit different functions. The bark is mainly used to
relieve symptoms of anxiety, depression, or improve diabetes and the flower
is used for congestion or sinus headaches [19].

- **How it works in the body?**

–– Magnolol and honokiol are the active compounds of Magnolia, they can pos­

sibly reduce inflammation [20].

- **Evidence for and against:**

–– *DM* : More research in humans is crucial to prove the clinical effect of magno­

lia on diabetes. In mice studies, magnolia may have an effect on regulating
crucial transporters of insulin production which then decreases blood glucose
levels [21, 22].
–– *Depression* : In rats, the active compounds of magnolia bark, have been shown

to regulate corticosterone levels and platelet adenylyl cyclase which are both
markers of depression [23].
–– *Anxiety* : In mice, honokiol may stimulate GABA-A receptors which can

decrease anxiety [24].
–– *Cancer* : Magnolia bark has been shown to decrease/inhibit many pathways of

cancer cell expression via binding to receptors/regulatory proteins [20].
–– *Congestion/headaches* : The flower of magnolia may be used for relieving

symptoms of congestion or sinus headaches [19].

- **Interactions with medications:**

–– Honokiol may inhibit the action of the following drugs by inhibiting or alter­

ing crucial enzymes [20].

CYP450 substrates.

UDP-glucuronosyltransferases.
P-Glycoprotein substrates.

–– Because magnolol can show antiplatelet activities, it can increase the risk of

bleeding when taking antiplatelet agents [20].
–– Lab studies showed that magnolia bark extract can be used as an anti-diabetic

agent by lowering blood glucose levels [20].
–– Magnolia bark extract and honokiol may increase the effects of benzodiaze­

pines [20].

- **Safety concerns, side effects, and precautions:**

–– Magnolia can cause contact dermatitis [20].


-----

116 A. Weisstuch

–– Magnolia should not be taken with sleep, anxiety, diabetic medications, or

blood thinners as it can increase the effects [20].

- **Dosage:**

–– Dosage of the Magnolia bark extract varies from 200 to 800 mg/day [19].
###### **Manganese**

- **What is it?**

–– Manganese is a trace mineral that is found in small quantities throughout the

body. Magnesium is mostly found in bones and the main vital organs (kid­
neys, pancreas, and liver) [25].

- **How does it work in the body?**

–– Manganese plays a role in many bodily functions such as formation (bones,

blood clotting factors, sex hormones, connective tissue), metabolism (fat, car­
bohydrates), absorption (calcium), and regulation (blood sugar). It is also
imperative for the functioning of the brain and nerves. Lastly, manganese
helps in the process of neutralizing free radicals as it is a component of the
antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) [25].

- **What is it used for?**

–– Manganese can be used as an antiepileptic, help decrease symptoms of osteo­

porosis, increase levels of SOD, and decrease PMS symptoms [25].

- **Evidence for and against:**

–– *Osteoporosis* : A study showed that Mn can possibly decrease bone loss for

post-menopausal women (in conjunction with An, Cu, and Ca) [25]. No sig­
nificant clinical evidence that manganese can prevent osteoporosis [25].
–– *Arthritis* : More research is needed to study the relationship between the pro­

duction of SOD and manganese supplementation [25].
–– *PMS* : One study showed that patients with PMS had lower levels of manga­

nese in their blood [26].
–– *DM* : Some studies show that people with diabetes have low levels of Mn [27].

It is unclear if having diabetes lowers Mn, or if low levels in blood allow for
the development of diabetes [27].
–– *Epilepsy* : Some studies show that people with seizures have low levels of Mn.

It is unclear if having seizures lowers Mn, or if low levels in blood allow for
the development of seizures [25].

- **Safety concerns, side effects, and precautions:**


-----

4 Maca–Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6)


117


–– Higher manganese supplementation, requires more calcium and phosphorus

ingestion as they all work together in the body [25].
–– When supplementing manganese orally, side effects are rare. Toxicity can

occur if an individual is routinely exposed to manganese vapors or in those
receiving intravenous nutrition (containing Mn) for an extended period of
time [25].

Toxicity symptoms include: hallucinations, appetite loss, headaches,
uncontrolled muscle movements, extreme irritability, and leg cramps or
muscle stiffness [25].

- **Interactions with medications:**

–– When taking Haloperidol with Mn in individuals with liver disease, hallucina­

tions, and behavioral disturbances may occur. Antipsychotics could worsen
side effects of Mn supplementation [25].
–– Some blood pressure medications may decrease serum manganese levels [25].
–– Antacids or laxatives containing magnesium can lessen the effectiveness of

manganese supplementation. It may be beneficial to separate intake of mag­
nesium and manganese by ~1–2 h [25].
–– Certain antibiotics and manganese can interfere with each other’s absorption

(i.e., tetracycline and quinolone). It may be beneficial to separate intake of the
antibiotic and manganese by ~1–2 h [25].

- **Dosage:**

–– Manganese supplementation should not exceed 10 mg/day. The AI for men

older than 19 is 2.3 mg and for women older than 19 is 1.8 mg [25].
###### **Mangosteen**

- **What is it?**

–– Mangosteen is a tropical plant mainly found in Southeast Asia [28].

- **What is it used for?**

–– In traditional eastern medicine, mangosteen is used to heal wounds, treat diar­

rhea, and improve skin infections [28]. Mangosteen has also been shown to
reduce inflammation, stop the growth of some cancer cells, decrease damage
of LDL, and decrease infections (bacterial, fungal) [28].

- **How it works in the body?**

–– Mangosteen may reduce inflammation and damage of LDL.

- **Safety concerns, side effects, and precautions:**


-----

118 A. Weisstuch

–– Mangosteen can cause significant lactic acidosis ingestion and exacerbate

colitis (in mice) [29, 30].

- **Interactions with medications:**

–– Mangosteen can act as an antioxidant and interfere with chemotherapy [28].

Could also interact with Cytochrome P450 substrates [28].

- **Evidence for or against its different uses:**

–– Mangosteen contains xanthones alpha, beta-mangostins, and garcinone which

can hinder the development of mycobacterium tuberculosis [31].
–– Limited research exists on the effect of mangosteen in humans. One animal

study may reduce inflammation for asthma [32].
–– In vitro, mangosteen may weaken enzymes and LDL production which can

reduce damage of LDL [33]. It is important to note that further studies on
human subjects are crucial in order to make a clinical claim on the effective­
ness of mangosteen on cholesterol.
–– In animal subjects, isogarcinol, a compound of mangosteen, may exhibit anti-­

inflammatory effects [34].
–– Mangosteen xanthones may act as a chemoprotective agent against cancer

cells [28].
–– In a randomized, double blind, placebo control clinical trial completed in

2015, mangosteen was seen to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
effects [35].
###### **Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCT)**

- **What is it?**

–– MCTs are made of three fatty acid chains (6–12 carbons long) which are

attached to a glycerol particle. MCTs are readily available for absorption into
the GI tract and bloodstream [36, 37].

- **What is it used for?**

–– MCT is utilized for the management of GI disorders (malabsorptive disor­

ders—pancreatic insufficiency, chyle leaks, short bowel syndrome). MCT has
also been shown to reduce CAD, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, and obe­
sity [37].

- **How it works in the body?**

–– The digestion and absorption of MCTs is a faster process when compared to

long chain triglycerides. MCT does not stimulate CCK and is absorbed
through passive diffusion. MCT attaches to albumin and travels from the GI


-----

4 Maca–Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6)


119


tract into the portal system. Following this step, no further changes of the
MCT model are required [37].

- **Evidence for and against:**

–– A review conducted in 2016 does not show enough evidence to support that

MCT oil decreases the risk of cardiovascular risk [38].
–– Further research is needed on a large scale in order to prove the effect of MCT

oils on Alzheimer’s disease [39].

–– A randomized control trial concluded that an MCT-rich diet can have the

same effect as a ketogenic diet on epilepsy [40].
–– Intake of MCTs has a greater effect on reducing body weight when compared

to long chain triglycerides [41].

- **Safety concerns, side effects, and precautions:**

–– When taking large amounts of MCT oil, GI distress can occur (bloating, diar­

rhea, cramping, gas).
–– When cooking with MCT, the temperature should be <150 °C /302 °F. This

allows for a reduction in oxidation and therefore, savors the taste of the
food [37].
–– When administering MCT oil through a feeding tube, it is important to flush

the tube with water before and after [37].
–– MCTs do not contain essential fatty acids; therefore, another source of essen­

tial fatty acids should be provided to the patient in order to prevent defi­
ciency [37].

- **Dosage:**

–– One tablespoon/15 mL of MCT oil = 14 g fat +115 kcal.
–– Recommended maximum dose for improving GI disorders: 50–100 g/day

(equivalent to ~4–7 tablespoons/60–100 mL/day). MCT supplementation
should be slowly advanced to the maximum dose [37].
###### **Melatonin**

- **What is it?**

–– Melatonin is a hormone that helps control the sleep cycle [42].

- **What is it used for?**

–– The main use of melatonin is used to help symptoms of insomnia. It may also

be effect for seasonal affective disorder, migraines, and reduce negative side
effects of chemotherapy [43]. Melatonin has also been shown to reduce the
risk of certain cancers (prostate, breast), act as a cardioprotective agent,


-----

120 A. Weisstuch

decrease chronic pain, and to reduce symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome,
epilepsy, and sunburns [42, 43].

- **How does it work in the body?**

–– Melatonin is produced by the pineal gland. The secretion of melatonin is reg­

ulated by the body’s circadian rhythm. When there is sunlight, less melatonin
is produced and when there is darkness, more melatonin is produced [42, 43].

- **Safety concerns, side effects, and precautions:**

–– **Side effects** : Melatonin can cause headaches, drowsiness, trouble sleeping,

disruptions in sleep patterns, nightmares, confusion/AMS, fast HR, red in
face, itching, stomach cramps, low body temperature, dizziness, decreased
libido, breast enlargement in men (gynecomastia), and reduced sperm
count [42].
–– Melatonin is not recommended for women who are pregnant and/or nursing

or those struggling with depression [42].

- **Possible interactions:**

–– Could decrease the effects of antidepressants however further studies needed

on humans to confirm this [43].
–– Birth control could raise melatonin levels in the body. Additional supplemen­

tation of melatonin could result in too high of melatonin buildup [43].
–– Melatonin can decrease the effectiveness of blood pressure medications or

corticosteroids [43].
–– When taken in combination with anticoagulants, there is higher chance of

bleeding [43].

- **Dose:**

–– The typical adult dose of melatonin is 1–5 mg. Doses of 1 mg has been shown

to be just as effective as higher doses [44].

- **Evidence for or against its different uses:**

–– *Insomnia/sleep patterns* : A review showed individuals (<18 years old) with

sleep-onset insomnia and ADHD melatonin was effective in treating insomnia

[45]. A study of middle aged adults found that a prolonged release of melato­
nin can positively affect one’s sleep schedule [46]. Melatonin can also be a
useful agent to help combat jet-lag [47]. The majority of the studies included
in a systematic review, found that upon arrival to the destination, it is best to
take the melatonin close to the time of sleep [46].
–– *Seasonal affective disorder* : More clinical research is needed to prove the

clinical effect of melatonin on seasonal affective disorder [48].
–– *Migraines/chronic pain* : A randomized control trial concluded that melatonin

does not significantly help with migraine prevention [49].
–– *Reduce negative side effects of* *chemotherapy* : A randomized control trial was

conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of melatonin supplementation on


-----

4 Maca–Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6)


121


­chemotherapy side effects. One hundred subjects were randomized to either
receive chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy in conjunction with melatonin.
The subjects receiving melatonin had better outcomes such as longer survival
rate and less chemotherapy side effects [50].
–– *Cancers* : Melatonin has been shown to slow or stop the spread of breast can­

cer cells, prostate cancers, colon cancer, and slow tumor growth [51].
–– *Irritable bowel syndrome* : Melatonin has been shown to decrease IBS-related

symptoms in IBS patients [45, 52].
–– *Epilepsy* : Broad and detailed research is still needed on the effects of melato­

nin on epilepsy. Research is split on if melatonin helps or hinders those with
epilepsy [43].
–– *Sunburns* : Sunburn ointments with infusion of melatonin may help heal sun­

burns, however, further research is needed [43].
###### **Methionine**

- **What is it?**

–– Methionine is a key amino acid needed for proper growth and maturation. It

helps with metabolism and stress resistance by acting as a precursor for the
pathways [53].

- **How does it work in the body?**

–– *Methionine cycle* : Methionine and ATP produce *S* -adenosyl methionine

(SAM). SAM acts as a methyl donor to molecules allowing for the production
of *S* -adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). It is important that there are low levels of
SAH in the cells and, therefore, *S* -adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH/
AHCY) breaks it apart. The breakdown of SAH forms adenosine and l-­
homocysteine. Homocysteine can then be remethylated to form methionine.
Adequate functioning of the methionine cycle allows for proper growth and
development [53].
–– *Transsulfuration pathway* : Cysteine can be produced in the liver through the

transsulfuration pathway by using the by-product of the methionine cycle,
homocysteine. Cysteine is used for the production of certain proteins. An
important by-product of this pathway is H 2 S which has many important func­
tions. H 2 S can act as an antioxidant agent and helps to control inflammation,
insulin release, neural communication, and muscle relaxation [53].
–– *Salvage cycle* : Polyamines are produced from the regeneration of methionine

from SAM. As one ages, polyamine levels are lower [53].

- **Dosage:**

–– Methionine can be used for adults to increase acid in urine [54]:

Capsules: ~200 mg 3–4×/day.

A. Weisstuch


Tablets: 500 mg 3–4×/day.

- **What is it used for?**

–– Methionine can be used for the development and maintenance of lean body

mass [55].

- **Safety concerns, side effects, and precautions:**

–– Methionine is a precursor for homocysteine; therefore, excessive supplemen­

tation can lead to hyperhomocysteinemia which can put one at an increased
risk for cardiovascular disease [55].

- **Medication interactions:**

–– Methionine can decrease the effectiveness of levodopa; therefore, high doses

of methionine should be avoided when taking the medication. If taken
together, closely monitor for worsening clinical presentation and adjust dose
as necessary [56].

- **Evidence for or against its different uses:**

–– Human studies are limited on the effects of methionine supplementation.

Most studies involving various animals are inconclusive on the effects of
methionine supplementation. One study conducted on poultry concluded that
the supplementation of methionine improved growth [57].
###### **Milk Thistle**

- **What is it?**

–– Milk thistle is a plant, part of the asteraceae family. This herb primarily grows

in places that are dry and sunny. The seed of milk thistle contains a chemical
called silymarin, a flavonoid, which is the primary ingredient responsible for
its medicinal effect. Milk thistle functions as an antioxidant and anti-­
inflammatory agent [58].

- **What is it used for** [58] **?**

–– Milk thistle can be used to help treat alcohol or drug-induced liver damage,

and viral hepatitis [58, 59].
–– Milk thistle can be used to reverse the poisonous effects of a death cap mush­

room [58, 59].
–– The silymarin ingredient can be protective against cancer by preventing cell

growth and decreasing the flow of blood to tumors [58, 59].

- **How does it work in the body?**


-----

4 Maca–Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6)


123


–– Silymarin-phosphatidylcholine is a complex of silymarin that facilitates the

attachment of the supplement to the cell membrane, allowing for better
absorption than standard milk thistle. Once the complex attaches to the cell
membrane, it can prevent toxins from entering the cell [58].

- **Safety concerns, side effects, and precautions:**

–– **Side effects** : Milk thistle can cause GI disturbances and rashes [58].
–– **Precautions/concerns** : Pregnant or breastfeeding women, individuals with

hormone-related cancers, or with allergies to ragweed, chrysanthemums,
marigolds, chamomile, yarrow, or daisies, should not use milk thistle [58].

- **Possible interactions:**

–– Given milk thistle’s action in the liver, it may interfere with drug metabolism

of antipsychotics, phenytoin, halothane, birth control pills and/or hormone
replacement therapy [58].

Milk thistle may interfere with allergy drugs, statins, anti-anxiety drugs,
anticoagulants, and some cancer drugs [58].

- **Evidence for or against its different uses:**

–– *Alcoholic or hepatitis-induced liver disease* : A systematic review including

13 randomized clinical trials, concluded that milk thistle supplementation
does not significantly affect the clinical complications of histology of liver
disease. However, there was significance in reduction of liver-related mortal­
ity [60].
–– *Mushroom poisoning* : When given intravenously, Silibinin, a component of

milk thistle, can help reduce the poisonous effects of the amanita mushroom.
It does so by competing with the uptake at the liver [61].
–– *Viral hepatitis* : A systematic review was conducted to assess the effect of milk

thistle’s chemical compound, silymarin, on individuals with hepatitis B and
C. It was found that silymarin can lower levels of transaminase in the blood;
however, there is no evidence of the effect on viral load or the liver [62].
–– *Cancer* : A review concluded that milk thistle can be used for cancer preven­

tion. In vitro and vivo studies have shown that silymarin can act as a chemo­
protective agent, facilitate apoptosis in cancer cells, and potentially act as an
anti-inflammatory agent. Overall, milk thistle may be useful to use as an
adjunct therapy with chemotherapy [63].

- **Dosage:**

–– Silymarin can be taken via capsules, tablets, tinctures, or intravenously. When

taking silymarin for hepatoprotection a dosage of 420 mg three times a day
for 6–8 weeks is recommended. When supplementing for maintenance, the
recommended dosage is 280 mg/day. The recommended dosage for mush­
room poisoning is 33 mg/kg/day for ~81.67 h via intravenous solution [64].

###### **Myrtle**

- **What is it?**


A. Weisstuch


–– Myrtle is a plant most often found in Mediterranean regions. The berries,

leaves, flowers, and essential oils of plants have been used in traditional medi­
cines [65].

- **What is it used for?**

–– The myrtle plant can be taken for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti­

microbial effects. Additionally, it can be used to help treat GI disturbances
(ulcers, diarrhea, reflux) and decrease hyperglycemia in diabetics. Although
more studies are needed, myrtle plants can offer cardiovascular protec­
tion [65].

- **How does it work in the body?**

–– It is unknown how myrtle reacts in the human body.

- **Evidence:**

–– Evidence is extremely limited in the human population.

*Antioxidant* : Myrtle as an antioxidant has been studied in fish. A study
conducted in 2017 concluded myrtle was found to produce higher levels of
ghrelin (increasing appetite), improve lipid metabolism, and act as an anti­
oxidant agent [66].
*Anti-inflammatory* : Myrtle has been found to exhibit anti-inflammatory
effects; however, current studies are primarily assessing mice [67, 68].
*Antimicrobial* : Myrtle extracts have been shown to exhibit antibacterial
effects by making the cell more permeable and allowing the contents inside
the cell to leak out and elicit change. In one study, the extracts if myrtle,
stopped the growth of Gram-positive bacteria, however, no effects were
found for Gram-negative bacteria [69].
*GI* : Myrtle has also been found to have promising effects on gastrointesti­
nal diseases, specifically in rats. The gastrointestinal benefits are thought
to be related to myrtle’s antioxidant effects [65].
*DM* : A study from 2019, assessed the effects of myrtle berry extract on
diabetic rats. After ingestion, levels of hyperglycemia reduced [65].

- **Dosage:**

–– Recommended dosage in humans is not well enough studied to provide

recommendations.

- **Interactions:**

–– No well-studied medication interactions.

###### ** N -Acetyl-l-Cysteine**

- **What is it?**


125


–– Cysteine is an amino acid. The supplemental form taken is *N* -acetyl-l-­cysteine

(NAC) which the body breaks down into cysteine [70].

- **How does it work in the body?**

–– After the body breaks down *N* -acetyl-l cysteine to make cysteine, it further

breaks down into glutathione which functions as an antioxidant [70].

- **What is it used for?**

–– The main use is to help prevent kidney and liver damage in acetaminophen

overdose patients. NAC is typically given intravenously after an acetamino­
phen overdose [70, 71].
–– When NAC is combined with nitroglycerin, it can reduce chest pain, heart

attacks, or death [70].
–– NAC has also shown effectiveness in increasing glutathione levels for those

with HIV/AIDS [70].
–– While further research is needed, NAC may reduce flare-ups in those with

COPD [70].

- **Dosage:**

–– The dosage varies depending on health conditions but seems to have conclu­

sive recommendations for acetaminophen overdose.

*Acetaminophen poisoning* [72]:

    - 20 h protocol via IV: First administer 150 mg/kg for 15–60 min and

then decrease the dose to 50 mg/kg for the 4 h. For the last 16 h, increase
the dosage to 100 mg/kg. Overall this provides a total of 300 mg/kg
for ~20 h.

     - 72 h protocol orally: First provide a loading dose of 140 mg/kg and then

provide 70 mg/kg every 4 h.

- **Evidence for or against its different uses:**

–– *Acetaminophen overdose* : A review from 2008, studied the pathophysiology,

clinical manifestation, and management of acute acetaminophen toxicity. In a
case involving a middle aged woman suffering from acetaminophen overdose,
NAC was found to possibly improve liver failure [72].
–– *Angina* : A randomized control study evaluated the effects of nitroglycerin and

NAC on individuals suffering from angina. Although there was a large per­
centage of side effects, primarily headaches, it was found that when taking
nitroglycerin and NAC together, reductions in angina can occur [73].
–– *HIV/AIDS* : A commonality between HIV patients is glutathione deficiency,

and it has been theorized that NAC supplementation can be used to replete

A. Weisstuch


glutathione. A randomized, double blind placebo controlled trial by Rosa
et al. studied the supplementation of *N* -acetylcysteine in HIV patients and
concluded that glutathione was successfully replete in those given *N* -­
acetylcysteine [74].
–– *COPD* : A meta-analysis completed in 2009 concluded that NAC supplemen­

tation can significantly reduce the risk of COPD exacerbation. It is important
to proceed with caution when choosing NAC supplementation over traditional
inhaled corticosteroids as further research is needed [75].

- **Safety concerns/side effects/precautions:**

–– Toxic forms of cysteine are d-cysteine, d-cystine and 5-methyl cysteine which

should all be avoided [70].
–– Homocysteine levels could become elevated with NAC supplementation. It is

important to check homocysteine levels when supplementing NAC as high
levels of homocysteine have been linked to heart disease [70].
–– NAC can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea [70].

- **Interactions with medication:**

–– *N* -Acetyl cysteine has been shown to increase the effects of some medica­

tions, such as immunosuppressants, nitroglycerin, oxiconazole, and isosor­
bide [70].
–– *N* -Acetyl cysteine may lessen the effects of activated charcoal [70].
–– When taking NAC with nitroglycerin, it can lead to severe headaches [70].
###### **Niacin**

- **What is it?**

–– Niacin (Vitamin B3) is a water-soluble vitamin. It plays a role in the break­

down and metabolism of proteins, fatty acids, and carbohydrates [76].

- **How does it work in the body?**

–– Niacin is essential in the conversion of carbohydrates to glucose [77]. It also

aids in the production of sex and stress hormones [77].

- **What is it used for?**

–– Niacin can be used to lower LDL and triglycerides [77]. When supplementing

niacin, research has shown that those with heart disease may have slowed
progression of atherosclerosis and lower risk for heart attack or stroke [77].
–– Niacin may raise blood sugar but have positive effects on the amount of fat in

the blood; therefore, more research is needed on niacin supplementation for
diabetics [77]. Niacin is associated with lower risk of cataracts and ­Alzheimer’s


-----

127


disease [77]. Although more research is needed, applying topical niacin can
possibly improve skin conditions [77].

- **Dosage:**

–– RDA: 16 mg/day in adult males 14 years and older. 14 mg/day for females

14 years and older [77].
–– Multiple resources show variable doses between 1 and 3 g/day can be effec­

tive on lowering lipids for adults [76, 78, 79].
–– For high levels of LDL, 3000 mg/day of niacin supplementation has shown

effectiveness [76, 78].
–– With regular release niacin, it is recommended to start at 350 mg once daily

with dinner and increase every week until therapeutic dose is reached [79].
For extended release, it is recommended to start at 500 mg × 4 weeks (taken
at night time) and adjust by 500 mg or less every 4 weeks to a max of 2000 mg/
day [79].
–– Pellagra treatment for pediatrics: regular release 50–300 mg/day for

3–4 weeks [79].
–– Excessive intake is excreted by the kidneys, no toxicity levels have been

found [76].

- **Evidence for or against its different uses:**

–– *Skin* : A randomized, double blind control trial studied the effects of topical

niacin on facial photoaging. The 50 adults included in this study, applied 5%
niacinamide twice daily for 12 weeks. At the end of 12 weeks, there were
significant improvements in facial appearance [80].
–– *CVD* : Research has shown that niacin is one of the most useful agents to help

manage dyslipidemia. The coronary drug project demonstrated that niacin
supplementation had similar effects to statins for reduction in cardiovascular
disease and mortality [81]. In a 3-year trial, treatment of coronary disease
with simvastatin and niacin showed clinical and measurable benefits [82]. A
review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that nia­
cin improves endothelial function [83].
–– *DM* : A randomized control trial looked at the effect of niacin on lipid profiles

and glycemic control in individuals with diabetes. Niacin usage showed sig­
nificant improvements in HDL-C and LDL-C. Glucose levels were modestly
increased. This study concluded that niacin can be safely used for patients
with diabetes [84].

- **Safety concerns/side effects:**

–– Niacin supplementation can lead to flushing, pruritus, paresthesias, and nau­

sea [76, 78, 79].
–– Niacin supplementation is contraindicated in adults with significant liver dys­

function/disease, stomach ulcers, or kidney disease [79, 81]. Therefore, cau­
tion should be taken when supplementing niacin in those with excessive
alcohol intake [79].


-----

128

- **Interactions with medications:**


A. Weisstuch


–– Niacin should not be taken with antibiotic tetracycline as it interferes with the

absorption of the drug [77].
–– Niacin may enhance some anticoagulants, resulting in a greater risk of bleed­

ing [77].
–– Niacin can enhance blood pressure medications, resulting in lower blood

pressure levels [77].
–– Diabetics taking niacin should monitor blood sugar levels as it can be

increased [77].
–– Aspirin can be used as an agent to decrease niacin flush [77].
–– Alcohol can increase side effects when taken with niacin (flushing, hepatotox­

icity) [85].
–– Bile acid sequestrants should be taken separately from niacin as they may

decrease absorption [85].
–– Niacin should be avoided with use of simvastatin due to risk of rhabdomyoly­

sis [85].
###### **Omega-6 Fatty Acids**

- **What is it?**

–– Omega-6 fatty acids are essential polyunsaturated fatty acids. Most of the

omega-6 consumed is linolenic acid (LA; commonly found in vegetable oils)
which is when converted to gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) in the body.
Common sources of GLA can be found in various oils [86].

- **How does it work in the body?**

–– After ingestion, LA is converted into gamma-linolenic acid (GLA). GLA is

broken down to arachidonic acid (AA). GLA has been shown to decrease
inflammation [86].

- **What is it used for?**

–– Omega-6 fatty acids have a wide range of therapeutic effects. It has been

found beneficial for the following: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), allergies,
ADHD, breast cancer, eczema, high blood pressure, menopausal symptoms,
breast pain, osteoporosis, and PMS [86].

- **Dosage:**

–– The average diet provides sufficient omega-6 [86].

- **Evidence for or against its different uses:**

–– *RA* : A review looking at the effectiveness of herbal therapies on RA found

that studies involving GLA showed improvements in clinical outcomes.

129


Nonetheless, more research is needed to identify the dosage and duration of
treatment [87].
–– *Allergies* : Contrary to prior epidemiological studies, a systematic review and

meta-analysis from 2009 did not find benefits of supplementing omega 3 and
6 oils for preventing allergic diseases [88].
–– *ADHD* : Individuals with ADHD exhibit fatty acid abnormalities which could

possibly be affecting their behaviors. Supplementing fatty acids is found to be
safe; however, more research is needed to identify the potential benefits on
presentations of ADHD [89].
–– *Breast cancer* : It has been suggested that GLA can modulate steroid hormone

receptors and therefore benefit individuals with breast cancer. A study from
2000, provided GLA and tamoxifen or tamoxifen to 38 women with breast
cancer. The women that were treated with GLA and tamoxifen showed a

quicker clinical change. This study concludes that GLA can be used adjunc­
tively with tamoxifen for individuals with breast cancer [90].
–– *Eczema* : A meta-analysis looking at unconventional therapeutic approaches

for atopic eczema. This analysis did not find convincing evidence on the effi­
cacy of GLA supplementation on atopic eczema [91].
–– *Breast pain* : A meta-analysis looking at management of mastalgia, included

studies assessing the effects of evening primrose oil (EPO). There was no
significant advantage of EPO supplementation for management of mastalgia
when compared to the placebo [92].
–– *Osteoporosis* : A study looked at older women over the course of 3 years with

osteoporosis. The women who used EPA and GLA supplements were found
to have less bone loss than the placebo group [86].
–– *PMS* : Most studies did not show significant relief of PMS when supplement­

ing with GLA [86].

- **Safety concerns/side effects/precautions:**

–– **Precautions** : Individuals with a history of seizures should not take omega-6

as it may exacerbate symptoms. Pregnant individuals should not take certain
GLAs as it can result in early labor. Ingesting GLA doses greater than
3000 mg/day can lead to inflammation [86].
–– **Side effects** : One may develop headaches and GI disturbances when taking

EPO. GLA can possibly decrease blood pressure [86].

- **Interactions with medications:**

–– Niacin should be avoided with use of a number of medications. For example,

niacin supplementation can increase bleeding in those taking blood thinners.
Additionally, when linolenic acid breaks down into gamma-linolenic acid it
can increase effects of ceftazidime (antibiotic) as well as increase the effect of
chemotherapies [86].

###### **Omega-3 Fatty Acids**

- **What is it?**


A. Weisstuch


–– Omega-3 fatty acids are long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Most com­

mon dietary sources include alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), docosahexaenoic
acid (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Good sources of ALA include
flaxseeds and walnuts. EPA and DHA are found in fish [93].

- **How does it work in the body?**

–– The body does not produce omega-3 fatty acids; therefore, it is important to

ensure adequate consumption through the diet [94]. In the body, omega-3 fats
are incorporated with cell membranes and modulate the function of cell recep­
tors [95]. DHA and EPA lower triglycerides by reducing hepatic production
of VLDL (very low density lipoproteins) [96].

- **What is it used for?**

–– Omega 3 FA can be used to prevent cardiovascular disease by specifically

lowering triglyceride levels and blood pressure [93, 96]. Omega-3 fatty acids
can also be used in treatments for RA, depression, bipolar disorder, schizo­
phrenia, ADHD, cognitive decline, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),
asthma, some cancers and macular degeneration [94].

- **Dosage:**

–– Supplementing 3–4 g/day of omega 3 FA has been proven to be very effective

for lowering triglycerides. A dosage of <1 g/day may have little effect [93, 96].

- **Evidence for or against its different uses:**

–– *Cardiovascular disease* : Eating a diet rich in unsaturated fats has been proven

to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease, specifically improving HDL levels
and decreasing LDL/triglycerides. This can be done by following a
Mediterranean diet [97].
–– *RA* : One study looked at the effects of fish oil for the side effects of rheuma­

toid arthritis. A statistical improvement was seen in the group taking fish oil
on both pain and strength after 12 weeks of supplementation. Of note, best
improvements were seen in those supplements with fish and olive oil [98].
–– *Depression* : While it has been speculated that fish oil could have a positive

effect on depression, significant research has been unable to prove this as a
fact [99, 100].
–– *Bipolar disorder* : A randomized double blind placebo controlled study was

conducted to assess the benefits of supplementing ethyl-EPA for depressive
moods in bipolar individuals. After significant improvements were found, the
study concluded that ethyl-EPA can be used adjunctly with bipolar medica­
tions as an effective treatment [101].

131


–– *Schizophrenia* : A review from 2006 found that using omega 3 fatty acids as a

form of the treatment for schizophrenics remain inconclusive [102].
–– *ADHD* : Studies on diet changes with ADHD are common; however, more

research on the exact effect of omega-3 supplementation requires further
research [103].
–– *Macular degeneration* : A prospective study from 2001 showed an inverse

relationship between those who had four or more serving of fish/week with
age-related macular degeneration [102].
–– *Cognitive decline/dementia* : A well-known association between cognitive

decline and dementia has been studied through epidemiological studies.
These studies have concluded that omega 3 consumption has a positive effect
on the treatment or prevention of cognitive decline; however, more clinical
trials are needed [104].
–– *IBD* : Omega-3 fatty acids are found to help gastrointestinal disorders due to

their anti-inflammatory effects. Epidemiologic studies found that with inges­
tion of omega 3 fatty acids, there was a decrease in inflammatory bowel dis­
ease in eskimos. Results of a review looking at the effects of omega-3 fatty
acids on inflammatory bowel diseases were controversial [105].
–– *Asthma* : It is difficult to study the effects of fish oil on asthma due to the many

other factors in the environment that could exacerbate asthma. A study com­
pleted in 2000 conducted in a controlled hospital environment, exhibited less
symptoms when supplementing with fish oil [106].
–– *Cancers* : One study focused on the risk of prostate cancer and fatty fish con­

sumption. Six-thousand male participants over a 30-year time frame were
included in the study. Of those who ate no fatty fish were at a much higher risk
of prostate cancer when compared to those who did [107].

- **Safety concerns/side effects/precautions:**

–– Side effect of fish oil include GI upset such as nausea or diarrhea [93, 94].
–– Omega 3 should be avoided in those with fish allergies [96].
–– When supplementing with omega 3, patients with altered liver function may

exhibit increased ALT levels [96].

- **Interactions with medications:**

–– Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation can increase blood sugars, diabetic

patients may need to increase insulin dosage [94].
–– If an individual is on cyclosporin following a transplant, omega-3 fatty acid

supplementation may reduce medication side effects, such as elevated blood
pressure [94].
–– Omega 3 can increase antiplatelet effects of antiplatelet agents and may also

increase anticoagulant effects of anticoagulants [96].

###### **Oolong Tea**

- **What is it?**


A. Weisstuch


–– Oolong tea is a traditional Chinese tea that is produced in Southern China. It

is made from the *Camellia sinensis* tea plant through partial fermenta­
tion [108].

- **How does it work in the body?**

–– The exact mechanism of how oolong tea acts in the body is unknown.

- **What is it used for?**

–– There are limited human studies on the beneficial health effects of oolong tea.

As a traditional use, oolong tea has been thought to burn body fat or increase
metabolism effects. Some studies have focused on oolong tea’s relationship
with diabetes on whether it lowers blood glucose levels. Oolong tea can also
be used to increase energy due to its caffeine content.

*Diabetes* : Multiple studies have focused on the effect that oolong tea plays
on diabetes. One study conducted in 2011 focused on the long-term con­
sumption of oolong tea. They concluded a positive association between
prolonged oolong tea consumption and diabetes risk [109]. On the con­
trary, other studies found that after consuming oolong tea, glycemic levels
were decreased. However, it is important to note that these studies did not
focus on the long-term consumption of oolong tea [110, 111].
*Metabolism/fat burning* : A study conducted in 2003 looked at the resting
energy expenditure of participants before and after consuming oolong tea
when compared to those consuming water. It was suggested oolong tea had
a positive effect on metabolism [112].

- **Dosage:**

–– There is no exact dosage for oolong tea. With consuming 5300 mL of oolong

tea for short periods of time, a positive effect on burning fat has been
shown [111].

- **Safety concerns/side effects/precautions:**

–– Just like any caffeine containing beverage, oolong tea should be avoided with

other stimulants and should not be taken before bed.

- **Interactions with medications:**

–– Unknown.

###### **Pancrelipase**

- **What is it?**


133


–– Pancrelipase is a digestive enzyme supplement which contains proteases,

lipase, and amylase [113].

- **What is it used for?**

–– It is used in patients with any kind of pancreatic insufficiency such as chronic

pancreatitis, postsurgical pancreatic insufficiency, pancreatic cancer, cystic
fibrosis, or Crohn’s disease [113].

- **How does it work in the body?**

–– The basic environment of the duodenum activates pancrelipase and allows for

digestion. Lipase, protease, and amylase work to break down fats, protein,
and sugars [113].

- **Evidence:**

–– Pancrelipase is FDA approved. It has been studied for efficiency in clinical

trials and verified as a safe and effective options for those with pancreatic
insufficiency [113, 114]. One study conducted in 2021 showed significant
improvement of stool frequency or other symptoms associated with malab­
sorption after 1 week of receiving pancrelipase [115]. Another study con­
ducted in 2000 focused on patients with cystic fibrosis, they found that
enteric-coated, delayed-release pancrelipase were successful in decreasing
the amount of fat found in stool [116].

- **Safety concerns/side effects/precautions:**

–– Most common side effects of pancrelipase are GI upset such as changes in

bowel movements, vomiting, altered blood glucose levels, feelings of dizzi­
ness, or sore throat/cough [114].
–– High doses of pancrelipase could increase chances of fibrosing colonopa­

thy [114].
–– Pancrelipase should not be chewed or crushed as it could irritate the inside of

the mouth [114].

- **Interactions with medications:**

–– There are known contraindications for pancrelipase [114].

- **Dosage:**

–– Adults should start with 500 lipase units/kg of weight and buildup to a maxi­

mum of 2500 lipase units per meal [113, 114]. For higher doses give <10,000
lipase units/kg of body weight per day or <4000 lipase units/g of fat ingested
per day [114].

###### **Pancreatin**

- **What is it?**


A. Weisstuch


–– Pancreatin is a digestive enzyme supplement which contains trypsin, amylase,

and lipase [117]. Pancreatin can improve fat absorption [117].

- **What is it used for?**

–– Pancreatin is used for pancreatic insufficiency in those with impaired pancre­

atic function such as those with diabetes, pancreatic cancer, chronic pancre­
atitis, or cystic fibrosis [117].

- **How does it work in the body?**

–– Pancreatin supplementation functions as an exogenous enzyme in lieu of the

endogenous enzymes in those with pancreatic insufficiency. In order for
proper passage through the digestive tract [117, 118].

- **Dosage:**

–– The dosage of pancreatin depends on severity of the pancreatic insufficiency.

The dosage is also tailored to the patient’s age, weight, and genotype. Research
shows that in order to appropriately reduce steatorrhea, there should be a min­
imum dose of 25,000–500,000 IU of lipase/meal and 10,000 IU for snacks

[117, 119].

- **Evidence:**

–– All FDA approved forms of exogenous enzyme replacement therapies have

been proved successful through clinical trials [117].
–– Objective pancreatic function tests are not as reliable as liver function tests,

and it is therefore important to note that the efficacy of the drug is based on
subjective improvement of symptoms [119].
–– One study conducted in 2013, studied enteric-coated pancreatin replacement

for 1 year in those with chronic pancreatitis. They concluded pancreatin
showed significant improvement in symptoms of malabsorption [120].
–– There is evidence to support the use of both enteric-coated and unprotected

forms of pancreatin on fat digestion; however, further research is needed for
confirmation. Most forms of the available enzymes are enterically coated

[119, 121].

- **Safety concerns/side effects/precautions:**

–– Inflammatory colonic stenosis can occur with high dose ingestion of pancre­

atin [119].
–– Pancreatin should be avoided in those who are pregnant or breastfeeding as

the effects are unknown [118].

- **Interactions with medications:**


-----

4 Maca–Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6)


135


–– Pancreatin may potentially decrease the absorption of iron and folic acid.

Therefore, the administration should be separated [122].
–– Taking antacids separately from pancreatin, can improve the efficiency of the

drug. Therefore, one should wait at least 1 h between consuming antacids and
panreatin [118, 121].
###### **Pantethine**

- **What is it?**

–– Pantethine is made in the body from pantothenic acid (Vitamin B5). It func­

tions as an important precursor for Coenzyme A which assists carbohydrate
and lipid metabolism in the body [123, 124].

- **How it works in the body?**

–– Pantethine and cysteamine work together to inhibit acetyl-coenzyme (CoA)

carboxylase and HMG-CoA reductase. This inhibitory effect increases
Coenzyme A within the cells and therefore alters lipoprotein metabolism. The
exact mechanisms for how pantethine lowers cholesterol is still unknown [124].

- **What is it used for?**

–– When pantethine is taken as a supplement, it can help to lower cholesterol,

triglycerides and reduce risk of cardiovascular disease. It has also been theo­
rized that pantethine could act as a neuroprotective agent or have a positive
effect on Alzheimer’s [124].

- **Evidence for or against its different uses:**

–– *Cholesterol/triglycerides/cardiovascular disease* : A study conducted in 2011

followed 120 subjectives who are at low to medium risk of cardiovascular
disease. One group supplemented with 600 mg pantethine per day for 8 weeks
and then increased to 900 mg/day for another 8 weeks. The other group
received placebo pills. All subjects followed a similar diet. Those in the exper­
imental group had a significant lowering of triglycerides and LDL. More
research on a grand scale is needed to confirm this [123].
–– *Alzheimer’s* : Studies on the neurological and cognitive effect of pantethine

requires further research on human subjects before becoming a recommended
line of therapy for brain function [124].
–– *Fatty liver* .: Small trials have shown positive effects on fatty liver with

6 months of pantethine supplementation [125]. This goes hand in hand with
its effects of triglycerides and cholesterol. Larger clinical trials are
needed [125].

- **Medication interactions:**

–– No drug interactions listed.


-----

136 A. Weisstuch

- **Dosage:**

–– Clinical trials have seen therapeutic effects with 600–900 mg/day.

- **Safety concerns/side effects/precautions:**

–– Pantethine is known to be a fragile supplement; it must be kept refrigerated to

prevent breakdown [124].
–– Pantethine can cause diarrhea and elevated liver enzymes [124].
###### **Pantothenic Acid (Vitamin B5)**

- **What is it?**

–– Pantothenic acid is an essential water-soluble vitamin found in both food and

colonic bacteria [126].

- **How does it work in the body?**

–– Vitamin B5 is essential to break down carbohydrates into glucose. Pantothenic

acid helps produce red blood cells, and both sex and stress-related hor­
mones [127].

- **What is it used for?**

–– Limited research has shown that Vitamin B5 may be used to reduce elevated

cholesterol and triglyceride levels [127]. Additionally, although more research
is needed, Vitamin B5 can aid in wound healing [127].

- **Evidence:**

–– *Cholesterol* *and* *triglycerides* : A review completed in 2006, concluded that

the supplementation of pantethine may act as a triglyceride or cholesterol
lowering agent; however, further research is needed for confirmation

[127, 128].
–– *Wound healing* : Limited research has shown that when Vitamin B5 is com­

bined with Vitamin C, it may help optimize wound healing of surgical
wounds [129].

- **Dosage:**

–– Measured by AI not RDA [127, 130]. For adults >19 years, 5 mg is the AI

[127]. Therapeutic dosage of supplementation can range from 600 to 900 mg/
day [128].

- **Safety concerns, side effects, precautions:**

–– No known safety concerns/side effects.

- **Interactions with medications:**


-----

4 Maca–Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6)


137


–– The timing of Vitamin B5 and tetracycline should be separated as B5 can

interfere with the absorption of the antibiotic [127].
–– Vitamin B5 should not be taken with cholinesterase inhibitors as it could

increase the effects of the medication [127].
###### **Peppermint Oil**

- **What is it?**

–– Peppermint is a member of the mint family. It is a cross between watermint

and spearmint [131].

- **How does it work in the body?**

–– Peppermint allows for the muscles in the stomach to relax which can then

better the passage of bile, and thereby increase the flow of food through the
stomach. This process aids in reducing indigestion, flatulence, and bloat­
ing [132].
–– A key active component of peppermint, menthol, can break up mucus and

help with congestion [132].

- **What is it used for?**

–– Enteric-coated peppermint capsules can be beneficial to lessen side effects for

patients suffering from IBS. In other words, supplementation can be benefi­
cial for those experiencing stomach pain, flatus, bloating, or irregular bowel
movements. Peppermint oil relieves these symptoms as it can “reduce stimu­
lated motor activity” [133].
–– Peppermint oil can be used to relieve the itching or burning on the skin from

hives and/or poison ivy [132].
–– Peppermint oil can be used as a decongestant and expectorant with ointment

or rubs [132].
–– Peppermint oil can also be used as a treatment for nausea [132].

- **Dosage:**

–– There is no clear dosage for peppermint oil; however, multiple studies have

shown improvement in IBS symptoms with the following dosages [134]:

200 mg 3× daily for 1 month [134].
187 mg 3–4 times daily for 1 month [134].
225 mg 2× daily for 1 month [134].

- **Evidence for or against its different uses:**

–– *IBS* : A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in 2018 that

looked at the use of peppermint oil with the treatment of irritable bowel syn­
drome. Four trials compared the use of peppermint oil with a placebo for the


-----

138


A. Weisstuch


treatment of symptoms associated with IBS. It was concluded that peppermint
oil was more effective than the placebo in relieving IBS symptoms [134].
–– *Nausea* : A pretest and post-test research study by Lane et al. studied the effect

of peppermint spirits/aromatherapy (combination of peppermint and aromatic
ethyl alcohol base) on nausea. Participants rated their levels of nausea and it
was found that peppermint aromatherapy can be an effective addition to the
treatment of nausea [135].

- **Safety concerns/side effects/precautions:**

–– Peppermint oil should be avoided in those with GERD as it can relax the

lower esophageal sphincter and allow for acid to flow back into the stomach
which can worsen GERD symptoms [132]. If the non-enteric-coated capsules
are ingested, this may lead to heartburn [132].
–– Pure menthol is poisonous and large doses of peppermint oil can be danger­

ous [132].

- **Interactions with medication**

–– Peppermint oil should be avoided when taking cyclosporine, as it can slow the

breakdown in the body [132].
–– Antacids should be taken separately (~2 h). With less stomach acid, the pep­

permint capsules could dissolve in the stomach instead of the intestines. As a
result, the peppermint would have a lessened effect [132].
–– Other interactions with peppermint and medications have only been proven in

test tube or animal studies. Further research before providing actual claims is
needed [132].
###### **Phosphorus**

- **What is it?**

–– Phosphorus is the second most abundant mineral in the body. Majority is

stored in the bones and teeth [136].

- **How does it work in the body?**

–– Phosphorus works together with calcium to build strong bones and teeth. It

also aids in filtering waste in the kidneys and is essential to produce DNA and
RNA [136].

- **What is it used for?**

–– Phosphorus supplementation can be beneficial to treat hypophosphatemia,

osteoporosis, hypercalcemia, and possibly lower blood pressure [136].


-----

4 Maca–Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6)

- **Evidence:**


139


–– *Osteoporosis* *and* *hypercalcemia* : A study evaluated the relationship of cal­

cium and phosphorus and its prevention of osteoporosis. If calcium intake
increases, it is important to also increase phosphorus intake. If calcium levels
are higher than phosphorus, there can be a decrease in phosphorus absorption.
When treating osteoporosis, it is important to take calcium and phosphorus in
conjunction with one another [137].
–– *Blood pressure* : Research has found that sodium restriction is not the only

way to help treat hypertension. In other words, managing other minerals is
just as important in the treatment of hypertension. The International Study of
Macro- and Micro-Nutrients on blood pressure published in 2008, the results
showed possible lower blood pressure in those with increased phosphorus
intake. However, it is important to remember that this difference may be due
to the fact that those with higher phosphorus intakes follow a healthier diet
and have increased mineral intake from whole foods [138].

- **Dosage:**

–– The RDA for adults >19 years is 700 mg.

- **Safety concerns/side effects/precautions:**

–– Too much phosphorus can cause diarrhea and calcification of organs and soft

tissue. This can interfere with the body’s ability to use iron, calcium, magne­
sium, and zinc [136].
–– If there are higher phosphorus levels than calcium in the body, the body will

use calcium stored in the bones. This can lead to osteoporosis and gum/teeth
problems [136].
–– Phosphorus should be checked in alcoholics or those who frequently drink

alcohol. Alcohol can drain phosphorus from the bones and lead to hypophos­
phatemia [136].

- **Interactions with medications:**

–– A number of medications may decrease the amount of phosphorus in the body

and therefore supplementation would be considered. Medications that may
lower phosphorus in the body include antacids, anticonvulsants, bile acid
sequestrants, high doses of insulin, ACE inhibitors, cyclosporine, cardiac gly­
cosides, heparin, and NSAIDs [136].
–– Supplementing phosphorus while taking potassium supplements or medica­

tions that increase potassium (i.e., potassium sparing diuretics) could lead to
hyperkalemia [136].

###### **Potassium**

- **What is it?**


A. Weisstuch


–– Potassium is an essential mineral needed for cells to function [139].

- **How does it work in the body?**

–– Potassium has multiple functions in the body. Potassium acts as an electrolyte

and balances the amount of water inside cells. Additionally, it is crucial for
skeletal and smooth muscle contraction which is critical to maintaining nor­
mal function of the heart, muscular and digestive systems [139].

- **What is it used for?**

–– One obvious use for potassium supplementation is to treat hypokalemia which

could be caused by excessive losses (i.e., vomiting, diarrhea), malnutrition, or
malabsorption [140]. Other less common uses for potassium supplementation
include, the prevention of osteoporosis in older women, attempt to lower
blood pressure, and decrease risk of stroke [139].

- **Dosage:**

–– Adequate intake for adults >19 years old is 4700 mg/day [139].

- **Evidence:**

–– *Hypertension* : Hypertension has traditionally been managed with the intake

of salt, however, for the best management recent research has shifted its focus
to the replacement of other minerals, such as potassium [141, 142]. A system­
atic review published in 2006 looked at six randomized controlled trials. The
review found that there was no significant effect on hypertension with potas­
sium supplementation [143].
–– *Osteoporosis* : A cohort study was done to assess the effects of long-term

potassium ingestion on bone mineral density in elderly women. It was found
that higher intakes of potassium can possibly decrease the risk of osteoporo­
sis [144].
–– *Risk of* *stroke* : A meta-analysis conducted in 2011 looked into ten indepen­

dent prospective studies. They concluded a statistically significant decrease in
risk of stroke in those that were supplemented with potassium [145].

- **Safety concerns/side effects/precautions:**

–– Potassium supplementation could lead to GI upset such as diarrhea or nausea,

muscle weakness, slowed or irregular heart rate [139].
–– Potassium supplementation should be given to people with kidney disease.
–– Avoid potassium supplementation in those taking medications that can raise

serum potassium such as potassium sparing diuretics, Bactrim, Septra, and
ACE inhibitors [139].


-----

4 Maca–Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6)

- **Interactions with medications:**


141


–– Several medications increase the risk of hyperkalemia and therefore potas­

sium supplementation should be avoided. These medications include ACE
inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, potassium sparing diuretics, and
indomethacin [139].
###### **Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6)**

- **What is it?**

–– Pyridoxine is a water-soluble vitamin. The active form is pyridoxal 5′-phos­

phate [146].

- **How does it work in the body?**

–– Pyridoxine plays an important role in maintaining the nervous system as it

helps with normal brain and nerve function [147]. It also aids in the produc­
tion of antibodies and red blood cells [147]. Pyridoxal phosphate is essential
for gluconeogenesis during the transamination and decarboxylation of amino
acids and acts as a cofactor to convert homocysteine to cysteine [146].

- **What is it used for?**

–– Vitamin B6 deficiency is not common; however, it could occur in those with

alcoholism, and liver or kidney disease [147]. Supplementation is used to
ensure normal nerve function, produce hemoglobin and antibodies, and keep
blood sugars within normal limits [147]. Although research is pending, vita­
min B6 can also be used to reduce nausea during pregnancy and reduce the
risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) [147].

- **Dosage:**

–– The optimal dose is not well studied [148]. RDA is 1.3 mg/day for adults [147].

- **Evidence:**

–– *Diabetes* : Pyridoxine supplementation has been shown to be effective in low­

ering blood glucose in those with gestational diabetes [149].
–– *Nausea* *during pregnancy* : A review of randomized control trials looks at the

different ways to treat nausea and vomiting in pregnant women. Supplementing
30 mg of pyridoxine, was found to be a useful tool in reducing nausea [150].
–– *AMD* : A randomized control study including more than 5000 women, con­

cluded that supplementing 50 mg of vitamin B6, 1000 μg of vitamin B12, and
2500 μg of folic acid can lower the risk of AMD [151].
–– *Pain relief* /improve fine motor skills: When combined with thiamine and

cobalamin, pyridoxine has been shown to improve fine motor skills [152].
The triple supplementation of pyridoxine, thiamin, and cobalamin has also
been shown to relieve pain in diabetic patients [153].

A. Weisstuch


–– *Heart disease* : Elevated homocysteine levels have been linked to an elevated

risk of CVD. Supplementing folic acid, pyridoxine, and cobalamin may lower
homocysteine levels; however, research is not definitive on this [148, 154].

- **Safety concerns/side effects/precautions:**

–– Excessive intake of pyridoxine could impair coordination or sensory function

[147]. Other risks include dizziness, nausea, or a numbing feeling to hands/
feet [146].

- **Interactions with medication:**

–– Be sure to separate the timing of certain antibiotics (tetracycline) with pyri­

doxine supplementation, as B6 could limit the efficiency of the antibi­
otic [155].
–– Do not supplement with phenytoin or Levodopa as B6 could limit the potency

of the medications [155].

##### **Chapter 5**
#### **Quercetin–Syrian Rue**

**Michelle Gorbonosov and Lawrence Markel**
###### **Quercetin**

- **Gen:**

–– Quercetin belongs to a group of plant pigments called flavonoids that give

fruits and vegetables their color. Flavonoids are considered to be antioxidants.

- **Mechanism of Action:**

–– Flavonoids are antioxidants, meaning they neutralize free radicals that are

generally regarded as dangerous for being able to damage cell membranes
and DNA, causing cell death. These flavonoids, quercetin included, can
decrease the damage that free radicals cause. Quercetin can also stabilize cells
that release histamine in the body and therefore can have an anti-­inflammatory
and anti-histamine effect.

- **Dosage:**

–– The most common dose for adults is 500 mg one a day, but some people can

take up to 1000 mg a day.

154

- **Precautions:**


M. Gorbonosov and L. Markel


–– Generally considered safe, some side effects can include upset stomach and

headache. Very high doses above 1000 mg per day, there have been reports of
kidney damage as some evidence suggest that a product of quercetin can lead
to a loss of protein function.

- **Interactions:**

–– Quercetin may reduce the effectiveness of certain antibiotics. Quercetin may

enhance the effects of blood thinners such as warfarin, clopidogrel, aspirin as
well as drugs such as corticosteroids, digoxin, and medications that are
metabolized by the liver.
###### **Quince**

- **Gen:**

–– Quince is a small tree bearing a yellow fruit. The seed, fruit, and leaves are

used as medicine, primarily for digestive disorders, diarrhea, and gastrointes­
tinal inflammation.

- **Mechanism of Action:**

–– The mechanism of quince is not fully understood but is widely believed to be

an antioxidant, and it also may have a mechanism of inhibiting bacterial
growth, specifically against *Helicobacter pylori* infections.

- **Dosage:**

–– Not enough information is known to recommend dosages. However in a study

involving 137 pregnant women, a 10 mg dose of quince syrup taken with a
meal is as effective as traditional medication at relieving acid reflux symptoms.

- **Precautions:**

–– There isn’t enough information to know if quince is safe for medicinal use.

The seeds contain cyanide, which suggests that quince seeds might not
be safe.

- **Interactions:**

–– Quince contains a type of soft fiber called mucilage. Mucilage can decrease

the amount of medicine the body absorbs. Taking quince at the same time you
take medications by mouth can decrease the effectiveness of your medication.

###### **Red Clover**

- **Gen:**


155


–– Red clover is a perennial herb that commonly grows wild in meadows

throughout Europe and Asia and has been naturalized to grow in North
America. The red flowers at the end of the branched stems are usually dried
for therapeutic use.

- **Mechanism of Action:**

–– Red clover might help protect against heart disease, but studies in humans

have not found strong evidence. Red clover isoflavones have been associated
with an increase in HDL (good) cholesterol in pre- and postmenopausal
women, but other studies show conflicting results. Red clover may also have
blood-thinning properties, which keeps blood clots from forming. It appears
to improve blood flow.

- **Dosage:**

–– Dose may vary from person to person, but general guidelines are as follows:

Dried herb (used for tea): 1–2 tsp dried flowers or flowering tops steeped
in 8 oz. hot water for 1/2 h; drink 2–3 cups daily.
Powdered herb (available in capsules): 40–160 mg per day, or 28–85 mg of
red clover isoflavones.

- **Precautions:**

–– General side effects may include headache, nausea, and rash. Red clover may

increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in those people who are taking
blood-thinning medications.

- **Interactions:**

–– Red clover may interfere with the body’s ability to process some drugs that

are broken down by liver enzymes. For that reason, you should check with
your doctor before taking red clover. Red clover may increase effects of

estrogen.
###### **Red Raspberry Leaf**

- **Gen:**

–– Red raspberry is a plant that is the source of a widely eaten, tasty, sweet berry.

However, red raspberry fruit and leaf have also been used as medicine for
centuries. Red raspberry leaf is used for gastrointestinal tract disorders, high
blood pressure, fever, diabetes, and vitamin deficiency.


-----

156

- **Mechanism of Action:**


M. Gorbonosov and L. Markel


–– The chemicals in red raspberry might have antioxidant effects and help relax

blood vessels. They might also cause muscles to contract or relax, depending
on the dose and the muscle involved.

- **Dosage:**

–– Traditional dosages include 5–10 mg (1–2 tsp) crushed leaf per 240 mL of

water up to six times per day, or up to 12 g dry leaf.

- **Precautions:**

–– Red raspberry leaf might act like estrogen. If you have any condition that

might be sensitive to estrogen, don’t use red raspberry leaf.

- **Interactions:**

–– Insulin decreases blood sugar levels in the body. Red raspberry leaf might also

decrease blood sugar levels in the body. Taking raspberry leaf along with
insulin might cause blood sugar levels in the body to be too low. Monitor your
blood sugar closely.
###### **Red Sandalwood**

- **Gen:**

–– Red sandalwood is a tree and the wood at the center of the trunk and the bark

are used as medicine. It is used most commonly for digestive tract problems
and as a diuretic.

- **Mechanism of Action:**

–– Red sandalwood may increase the loss of body water through urine. It may

also decrease reabsorption of water in the bowels, reducing diarrhea.

- **Dosage:**

–– The general safe dosage for internal consumption is 2–5 g of the red sandal­

wood powder.

- **Precautions:**

–– Avoid use when constipated or dehydrated, as loss of water on top of these

conditions may have a negative effect on health.

- **Interaction:**

–– Red sandalwood might have an effect like a water pill or “diuretic.” Taking

red sandalwood might decrease how well the body gets rid of lithium. This


-----

5 Quercetin–Syrian Rue


157


could increase the amount of lithium in the body and result in serious side
effects.
###### **Red Yeast Rice**

- **Gen:**

–– Red yeast rice has been used for centuries in China as both food and medi­

cine. It is made by fermenting a type of yeast called *Monascus purpureus* over
red rice.

- **Mechanism of Action:**

–– Red yeast rice contains chemicals that are similar to prescription statin medi­

cations. One of these, called monacolin K, has the same makeup as the drug
lovastatin.

- **Dosage:**

–– Most studies have used standardized extract: 600 mg, 2–4 times daily.

- **Precautions:**

–– People with liver disease, and those at risk for liver disease, should not take

red yeast rice. Red yeast rice may affect the function in the same way pre­
scription drugs to lower cholesterol can.

- **Interactions:**

–– If you take a statin, grapefruit and grapefruit juice can increase the amount of

the drug in your blood. That can give you a greater chance of side effects and
liver damage. Because red yeast rice may act like statins in the body, you
should not drink grapefruit juice or eat grapefruit while taking red yeast rice.
–– Additionally, red yeast rice also may lower amounts of CoQ10 in the body.
–– CoQ10 is very important in heart and muscle health and in energy production. **Rhubarb**

- **Gen:**

–– Rhubarb is a plant and the stalk is commonly eaten. Its root and underground

stem are used make medicine. Taking a rhubarb root extract by mouth seems
to improve symptoms of menopause, including hot flushes, mood, quality of
life, and fatigue. Rhubarb is also used for the management of Gi disorders as
it has a mild laxative effect.


-----

158

- **Mechanism of Action:**


M. Gorbonosov and L. Markel


–– Mechanisms of action have been proposed and include inhibition of protein

decomposition, accelerated reutilization of certain amino acids, reduction of
the formation of free radicals, inhibition of overexpression of plasminogen
activator inhibitor-1, and suppression of cytokines.

- **Dosage:**

–– Dried rhubarb extract 20–50 mg/kg daily has been used in clinical trials and

is a commonly accepted dosage.

- **Precautions:**

–– There are chemicals in rhubarb that might harm the kidneys or increase the

risk of kidney stones. Don’t take rhubarb if you have a bowel obstruction,
appendicitis, unexplained stomach pain, or inflammatory conditions such as
Crohn disease, colitis, and irritable bowel syndrome.

- **Interactions:**

–– Because rhubarb can harm kidneys, avoid taking with nephrotoxic medica­

tions. Avoid taking rhubarb with laxatives as rhubarb already has a laxative
effect on the body and may cause diarrhea.
###### **Riboflavin (Vitamin B2)**

- **Gen:**

–– Vitamin B2, also called riboflavin, is one of eight B vitamins. All B vitamins

help the body to convert food (carbohydrates) into fuel (glucose), which is
used to produce energy. These B vitamins, often referred to as B-complex
vitamins, also help the body metabolize fats and protein. B-complex vitamins
are necessary for a healthy liver, skin, hair, and eyes. They also help the ner­
vous system function properly.

- **Mechanism of Action:**

–– In addition to producing energy for the body, riboflavin works as an antioxi­

dant, fighting damaging particles in the body known as free radicals. Free
radicals can damage cells and DNA and may contribute to the aging process,
as well as the development of a number of health conditions, such as heart
disease and cancer. Antioxidants, such as riboflavin, can fight free radicals
and may reduce or help prevent some of the damage they cause.

- **Dosage:**

–– Daily recommendations for adults are as follows:


-----

5 Quercetin–Syrian Rue 159

Men, 19 years and older: 1.3 mg (RDA).
Women, 19 years and older: 1.1 mg (RDA).
Pregnant women: 1.4 mg (RDA).
Breastfeeding women: 1.6 mg (RDA).

–– Please consult a healthcare provider before giving riboflavin supplements to

those 18 years of age or younger.

- **Precautions:**

–– Riboflavin is generally considered safe, even at high doses. Riboflavin does

not seem to cause any serious side effects. However, extremely high doses
may cause itching, numbness, yellow or orange urine, or sensitivity to light.

- **Interactions:**

–– Please speak to healthcare professional when taking riboflavin with anticho­

linergic medications, tetracyclines, tricyclic antidepressants, antipsychotic
medication, thiamine diuretics, phenytoin, and doxorubicin.
###### **Roman Chamomile**

- **Gen:**

–– Chamomile is one of the most popular herbs in the Western world. There are

two plants known as chamomile: the more popular German chamomile and
English chamomile. Both are used to calm frayed nerves, to treat stomach
problems, to relieve muscle spasms, and to treat skin conditions and mild
infections.

- **Mechanism of Action:**

–– Roman chamomile has the characteristics of multi-target and multi-pathway

in the treatment of anxiety disorder. Its possible mechanism is to intervene
anxiety disorder in the process of disease development, such as neuroactive
ligand–receptor interaction, serotonin synapse, and cAMP signaling pathway.

- **Dosage:**

–– For adults drinking tea, pour 1 cup of boiling water over 2–3 heaping tsp

(2–4 g) of dried herb, steep 10–15 min. Drink 3–4 times per day between meals.

- **Precautions:**

–– Roman chamomile is considered generally safe, however has some precau­

tions to keep in mind. Chamomile may make asthma worse, so people with
asthma should not take it. Pregnant women should avoid chamomile because
of the risk of miscarriage. If you are allergic to asters, daisies, chrysanthe­
mums, or ragweed, you may also be allergic to chamomile. Drinking a lot of


-----

160 M. Gorbonosov and L. Markel

highly concentrated chamomile tea may cause vomiting. Chamomile may
cause drowsiness, so please do not take it while operating machinery or driv­
ing. Stop taking chamomile at least 2 weeks before surgery or dental work
because of the risk of bleeding.

- **Interactions:**

–– Please do not use chamomile without taking to your healthcare provider if

you are also taking blood-thinning medications, sedatives, blood pressure
medications, diabetes medications, birth control pills, certain antifungal
drugs, or drugs that lower cholesterol.
###### ** Saccharomyces boulardii**

*Saccharomyces boulardii* is a yeast species. In the Western world, it was discovered
by a French microbiologist in 1920s who noted that certain people drinking a tea
made from lychee and mangosteen did not develop cholera [1]. He isolated
*Saccharomyces boulardii* from this tea. *S. boulardii* works as a probiotic; it is
thought to transiently colonize the gut microbiota to minimize pathogenic microor­
ganisms from growing and produce bioactive metabolites [2].

- **Dosage:**

–– For adults, doses of 250–500 mg (about 5–10 billion colony-forming units)

for up to 4 weeks. Some studies have examined up to 1000 mg for potentially
up to 4 weeks [3]. In infants, doses of 50–200 mg/kg daily for up to 28 days

[4]. A variety of formulations are available of *S. boulardii* but not all have
been studied to be found effective.

–– The main uses of *S. boulardii* include:

**Diarrhea and antibiotic-induced diarrhea** : In children, it has been
shown to decrease acute diarrheal episodes [4]. In adults, there is conflict­
ing evidence regarding antibiotic-induced diarrhea (AID) [4]. Some stud­
ies, including meta-analyses, have shown that it can prevent or reduce AID
if started within 48 h of antibiotics while other studies show no difference

between groups taking and not taking *S. boulardii* [4].
***Clostridium difficile*** **(** ***C. diff*** **) diarrhea** : A 2015 meta-analysis that showed
*S. boulardii* reduced acute diarrheal episodes in adults and children found
that it, also, reduced the occurrence of *C. diff* in children but not adults [5].
The Infectious Disease Society does not recommend the use of probiotics,
including *S. boulardii*, for prevention of *C. diff* infections due to insuffi­
ciency evidence [6].
***Helicobacter pylori*** : A 2019 systematic review with a meta-analysis
showed that *S. boulardii* can improve eradication rates of *H. pylori* when


-----

5 Quercetin–Syrian Rue


161


used conjointly with triple therapy while also reducing gastrointestinal
side effects [3]. The dosage studied was 100–1000 mg for 1–4 weeks [3].
**Necrotizing enterocolitis** : A 2021 systematic review with meta-analysis
showed that *S. boulardii* can prevent necrotizing enterocolitis, reducing
feeding intolerance and hospitalization time [7]. However, there was no
effect on mortality or progression to sepsis [7].

- **Safety:**

–– This is a relatively safe probiotic. Some studies report rare cases of fungemia

in older adults, immunocompromised patients and adults with central venous
catheters [4]. People with a yeast allergy may be allergic to this and other
probiotics [4].

- **Medication Interactions:**

–– A minor interaction with antifungals [4].
###### ** S -Adenosyl-l-methionine**

*S* -Adenosyl-l-methionine (SAMe) is a compound found in the human body. It
works by donating a methyl group, contributing multiple different reactions to
metabolize hormones, neurotransmitters, and proteins [8]. It was discovered in Italy
by Cantoni [9].

- **Dosage:**

–– For adults with osteoarthritis, 400–1200 mg daily in up to three divided doses

for up to 84 day has been studied [8]. One study looked at intravenous loading
dose of SAMe 400 mg daily for 5 days, then switching to oral can improve
symptoms as quickly as 14 days [10]. For cholestasis in liver disease, studies
have looked at SAMe 500 BID orally or 1600 mg orally once a day for 2–8
weeks, or IV 800 mg daily or IV 500 mg BID for 2–3 weeks [8]. SAMe for
depression has been studied at doses of total 800–1600 mg orally for 4–12
weeks and IV/IM at 200–400 mg 1–4 weeks [8]. Oral formulations should be
taken with food.

–– The main uses studied include:

**Osteoarthritis** **(knee** **and** **hip)** : Older studies from the 1980s and 1990s
compared SAMe at doses above to placebo and other NSAIDs, showing
that SAME can be as effective as NSAIDs in improving osteoarthritis
symptoms [8]. It may require up to 30 days to get the full effect of SAMe
treatment. IV treatment can take 14 days to experience the full effect [8].
A Cochrane review from 2009 did say this treatment for osteoarthritis is
inconclusive but more data is needed to prove this treatment is clinically
effective [11].


-----

162 M. Gorbonosov and L. Markel

**Major** **depression** : Studies have shown mixed results when SAMe is used
alone when compared to placebo, TCAs, and escitalopram [8]. However,
when used in combination with traditional treatment in patients not
responding to their current treatment, it can improve remission rates [12].
IV/IM formulations have been shown to be better than placebo and as good
as TCAs when used at the doses above [8].
**Cholestasis** : When compared to placebo, some studies stated that SAMe at
the doses above can improve patient symptoms such as pruritus and fatigue
as well as markers of disease including alkaline phosphatase levels [8].
Some studies were conducted looking at SAMe for intrahepatic cholestasis
of pregnancy, but the results were mixed [13].

- **Safety:**

–– Well tolerated at the doses above but at higher doses can cause GI distress,

nausea, vomiting, sweating, and insomnia [8].

- **Medication Interactions:**

–– Levodopa, Serotonergic drugs as SAMe has some serotonergic properties [8].
###### **Sage**

Sage consists of multiple plants part of the *Salvia* genus comprised have many dif­
ferent species. The two most common species that have been used as medicine are
*Salvia officinalis* and *Salvia lavandulifolia* (Spanish sage) [14]. The leaf and oil
contain compounds that are thought to have antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidant
effects as well as others in in vitro and animal studies [14].

- **Dosage:**

–– Sage extract has been studied from 280 to 1500 mg daily for up to 12 weeks

[14]. Spanish sage essential oil has been studied at a single dose of 25–50 μL

[14]. Sage can be found in creams and ointments that can be used topically.
–– The main uses studied include:

**Cognition/memory** : An RCT study that was published in 2021 looking at
improvement in cognition used a compound called Cognivia, which com­
bined sage polyphenols and Spanish sage terpenoids [15]. The treatment
group, compared to placebo, received a single dose of 600 mg of Cognivia

[15]. Memory was assessed within 2–4 h after the single dose and after 29
days. It showed there was improvement in memory after 29 days. Essential
oils of sage may improve memory, but aromatherapy has not shown the
same effect [14].
**Hyperlipidemia (HLD)** : An RCT (published 2011) 500 mg of sage three
times a day for 2 months can improve LDL and triglyceride levels while


-----

5 Quercetin–Syrian Rue


163


increasing HDL levels [16]. However, the study did not look at long-term
morbidity or mortality improvement in patients with HLD.
**Menopausal symptoms** : Sage seems to improve menopausal symptoms
such as hot flashes and irritability; however, it does not seem to improve
vaginal dryness and sexual desires [14]. Doses range from 280 mg daily
for 4 weeks to 300 mg daily for 3 months [14].

- **Safety:**

–– Sage is generally safe, however a few components of sage including thujone,

camphor and cineol components can be toxic in large amounts [14].

- **Medication Interaction:**

–– Sage may interact with anticholinergics, antihypertensives, antidiabetics,

anticonvulsants, cholinergic medications, medications that interfere with the
CYP450 system substrates, and estrogens [14]. Please be mindful when start­
ing your patient on doses of Sage listed above.
###### **Sangre de Grado**

Sangre de grado ( *Croton lechleri* ) is a tree native to certain countries in South
America. The red sap produced by the tree is used as medicine to treat certain condi­
tions. The sap contains alkaloids, the main one being taspine, as well as proantho­
cyanidins [1]. Sangre de grado is thought to have multiple mechanisms including
blocking sensory afferent nerves to improve pain and inhibiting chloride channels in
the gastrointestinal tract to minimize sodium and water loss, improving diarrhea [1].

- **Dosage:**

–– Crofelemer (FDA approved to treat HIV-related diarrhea) is dosed at 125 mg

twice a day for 4 weeks [1]. For traveler’s diarrhea, 125–500 mg up to four
times a day for 2 days has been used [1]. For genital herpes, formulations of
a sangre de grado ointment containing 15% Crofelemer used three times a day
for 21 days has been studied [1].
–– The main uses for sangre de grado are listed below:

**HIV-induced diarrhea** : A randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 2013
showed that Crofelemer, which contains multiple proanthocyanidins,
improved diarrheal episodes in HIV/AIDS patients [2]. Crofelemer has
been FDA approved for this use.
**Traveler’s diarrhea** : A product called SP-303, which contains a concen­
trated version of certain components of sangre de grado was studied in a
randomized placebo-controlled trial in 2002 [4]. It was shown to shorten
the duration of traveler’s diarrhea [4].


-----

164 M. Gorbonosov and L. Markel

**Genital herpes** : In patients with HIV/AIDs who has anogenital warts or
herpes eruption, a topical form of sangre de grado was studied back in
1997 [17].
Compared to placebo, the study did show shorter time to heal compared to
placebo; however, there was a small sample size. There are currently no
recent studies that further evaluated the topical form.

- **Safety:**

–– While the medication is safe and well-tolerated, overdose is possible. Side

effects in animal studies have been shown at varying doses [1].

- **Medication Interaction:**

–– No known current interactions at this time.
###### **St. John’s Wort**

St. John’s wort ( *Hypericum perforatum* ) is a yellow plant that is native to Europe
and Asia and has been used there for centuries. It works mainly as a serotonin reup­
take inhibitor, but can also inhibit the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine. It
does this by activating the cytochrome P450 system, specifically CYP3A4 and
monooxygenase enzymes. The main compounds in St. John’s Wort that have this
mechanism are hypericin and hyperforin.

- **Dosage:**

–– The usual dosage for St. John’s wort with 0.3% hypericin or 5% hyperforin is

300 mg orally BID or TID (total daily dose of 600–900 mg) or topically.
–– The main uses for St. John’s wort are listed below:

**Depression** : St. John’s wort works similarly to SSRIs with the mechanism
for the treatment of depression. Meta-analysis and individual trials have
compared St. John’s wort to placebo as well as other anti-depressant medi­
cations. It has shown to improve depression symptoms for patients. Some
studies mentioned that some participants tolerated St. John’s wort better
than SSRIs. However, other studies have shown that it was no more effec­
tive than placebo. Severe forms of depression should not be treated with St.
John’s wort.

**Somatoform disorders** : There is some data that St. John’s wort can be

used to improve symptoms of somatoform disorders compared to placebo.
However, some of the studies did not follow patients for a prolonged period
of time and did not include data on adverse side effects.
St. John’s wort may be beneficial with symptoms relating to premenstrual
cravings, cramping and irritability, menopausal symptoms such as hot


-----

165


flashes, seasonal affective disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder,
and eczema

- **Safety Concerns:**

–– The most concerning safety concerns are regarding the interactions St. John’s

wort has with other commonly used medications (as discussed below).
Common side effects reported if St. John’s wort is taken alone include dizzi­
ness, anxiety, fatigue, diarrhea, photosensitivity, and dry mouth. It is contra­
indicated in pregnancy and lactation.

- **Interactions:**

–– St. John’s wort interacts with many common prescription medications due to

its proposed mechanism of action. It can reduce the effectiveness of the medi­
cations listed below:

–– Allergy medications: Loratadine, Fexofenadine, Cetirizine; Antidepressants:

SSRIs, TCAs, MAO inhibitors, Nefazodone; Birth control pills, Clopidogrel,
Coumadin, Cyclosporine, Digoxin, HIV medications including protease
inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors;
Immunosuppressant medications such as Adalimumab (Humira), Statins,
Triptans, Warfarin.
###### **Sorrel**

Sorrel is a perennial plant that grows in Europe and Asia. The main ingredients in
Sorrel are tannins, which are bitter compounds, along with proanthocyanidins and
Flavan-3-ols [18]. The mechanism behind how sorrel may treat rhinosinusitis is by
dehydrating cells and reducing secretions [18]. Other possible actions sorrel may
have include anticarcinogenic, antimicrobial, and anti-platelet, but these were
mostly in vitro studies [18].

- **Dosage:**

–– Studies have looked at sorrel when used in combination with other products

including Elderflower and Gentian root [18]. The dosage of sorrel in these
combinations was 36 mg TID for up to 14 days [18].
–– The main use of sorrel is for:

**Rhinosinusitis** : A product named Sinupret, which is a combination of
multiple herbs including sorrel, was compared to placebo to see if symp­
toms of rhinosinusitis improved [19]. However, these patients also may
have taken antibiotics and decongestants. Other studies did show symp­
toms improvement as well [18]. One study looked at Sinupret in combina­
tion with Nasonex and it showed symptoms improvement [20]. Since

166 M. Gorbonosov and L. Markel

sorrel has not been studied on its own, it is unclear which compound is
improving rhinosinusitis symptoms.

- **Safety:**

–– Sorrel is general safe but patients can overdose on the plant if ingesting more

than 15–30 g though lower doses may be fatal as well [18]. Oxalic acid is the
compound that can cause overdose [18]. In 1989, a patient did fatally over­
dose on sorrel soup [21].

- **Medication Interactions:**

–– Anticoagulants, Allegra, Calcium, Iron, and Zinc [18].
###### **Spearmint**

Spearmint is a mint plant that grows in Europe, Asia, and the United States. It is
used as a flavoring in the food industry.

- **Dosage:**

–– Doses varied in studies but included two cups of pure spearmint tea, 900 mg

daily of spearmint. Duration varied as well from weeks to months.
–– The main use for spearmint includes:

**Cognition** : When compared to placebo, spearmint may improve mood and
working memory in older adults with age-associated memory problems

[22]. However, there are conflicting studies that show that spearmint gum
does not improve cognition. In healthy adults, attention may improve when
taking spearmint but not memory [22].
**IBS** : A small study looked at improvement in abdominal pain in patients
with IBS after taking 30 drops of a combined solution containing spear­
mint, coriander, and lemon balm along with psyllium or loperamide [23].
While scores improved, it was not clear if it was the individual products or
the combination that improved symptoms.
**Hirsutism** : There are some studies that concluded that spearmint for the
dosing and duration above may improve hirsutism. One randomized-­
control trial showed that people with PCOS perceived their hirsutism
improved with improvement in testosterone levels [24]. The duration of
tracked patients over 30 days and had patients report a subjective assess­
ment of their hirsutism [24]. However, objectively it seemed that the
amount of hair was actually not reduced [24].
**Osteoarthritis** : A study in 2014 did show that spearmint may improve
pain in osteoarthritic patients [25]. However, the study did not have a con­
trol group to compare and based the scores on subjective pain scoring.

- **Safety:**

–– The dosage used in foods is safe for adults, children, and pregnant patients.

However, doses at higher doses may not be safe.

- **Medication Interactions:**

–– Spearmint may interact with drugs that can cause liver damage or CNS

depression [26].
###### **Saw Palmetto**

Saw palmetto ( *Serenoa repens* ) is a small palm tree native to the United States that
has been used to treat issues related to male and female reproductive organs. The
part of the plant that is considered active would be the free fatty acids and sterols.
Its proposed mechanism of action is that it inhibits 5-alpha-reductase; this decreased
the conversion of testosterone to DHT. Some studies suggest that it may decrease
inflammation by minimizing prostaglandin and leukotriene production.

- **Dosage:**

–– The dosage of saw palmetto used in studies is 160 mg twice a day or 320 mg

once a day of which 80–90% should contain the volatile oil. Limited data is
available for use in children and during pregnancy.
–– The main uses of saw palmetto are discussed below:

**Benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH)** : The most common use of saw pal­
metto is to treat the symptoms of BPH including diminished stream, post-­
void dribbling, overflow incontinence, and urinary retention. A
meta-analysis initially published in 2002 showed that saw palmetto com­
pared to placebo did improve the symptoms of BPH as measured by the
International Prostate Symptom Score. However, an update to the metaanalysis published in 2009 that included nine new trials showed that it did
not improve symptoms compared to placebo. In 2012, two other new longterm trials included in the meta-analysis supported the second conclusion
that saw palmetto compared to placebo did not improve symptoms.
**Alopecia** : A systematic review published in 2020 did show some evidence
that saw palmetto may benefit patients with androgenic alopecia and telo­
gen effluvium.

Some other limited data does show that saw palmetto can promote urina­
tion and show anti-inflammatory effects, but there is insufficient data to
support its clinical use.

- **Safety:**

–– Saw palmetto is thought to be safe. Its main side effects are mild but include

gastrointestinal distress, headaches, rhinitis, and fatigue. Saw palmetto does
not falsely lower PSA levels. Some case reports have reported hot flashes in


-----

168 M. Gorbonosov and L. Markel

young girls, acute pancreatitis, liver damage, coagulopathy, and prolonged
bleeding time.

- **Medication Interactions:**

–– Saw palmetto can inhibit the CYP 450 system so it can potentially effect with

Warfarin, Clopidogrel, and aspirin. It is recommended to not use simultane­
ously with finasteride.
###### **Syrian Rue**

Syrian rue ( *Peganum harmala* ) is a white flower shrub that grows in the Mediterranean
regions. The parts of the plant that are thought to be medicinal include the beta-­
carboline and quinazoline alkaloids (harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine).
It has been used as a stimulant, a sedative while also containing hallucinogenic
properties. It is thought to have many mechanisms in the body, most importantly it
can inhibit monoamine oxidase, act as an anticholinergic, antispasmodic, antihista­
minic, and antiadrenergic. It may have some antineoplastic properties. It is most
likely unsafe in pregnancy and breastfeeding.

- **Dosage:**

–– More clinical trials need to be completed to determine if a safe oral dose can

be used. A topical dose of four drops three times a day for 4 weeks has been
studied in knee pain/osteoarthritic patients as detailed below.
–– The main uses for Syrian rue include:

**Anti-hypertensive** : In vitro studies have shown that Syrian rue can cause
vasorelaxant effects on vessels, lowering blood pressure. However, there
are no available randomized-control trials that support the in vitro studies.
**Osteoarthritis** : In a 2015 randomized controlled trial, 54 participants
(27 in treatment, 27 in control) with knee pain rubbed four drops of Syrian
rue three times a day on their knees for 4 weeks or olive oil. The study
showed decrease in pain and function difficulty when compared to placebo.

Some limited data is available that shows improvement in anti-depressant
symptoms, amenorrhea, rheumatoid arthritis, and Parkinson’s disease.

- **Safety:**

–– Possibly safe when used topically. The safety when used orally is unclear and

has been shown to be a strong hallucinogenic. It may cause hypertension,
tachycardia, and tachypnea at high doses.

- **Medication Interactions:**


169


–– Medication interactions include CYP 450 2D6 and 3A4 substrates, serotoner­

gic drugs, anticholinergic and cholinergic drugs, dopamine agonists, hepato­
toxic drugs, and caffeine as seen in in vitro and animal studies.

##### **Chapter 6**
#### **Tamarind– Vitex agnus-castus**

**David Shukhman and Paul Bernstein**
###### **Tamarind**

Tamarind is a tree which is used for constipation, liver and gallbladder problems,
and stomach disorders. It is also used to treat colds and fever. Women sometimes

use tamarind to treat pregnancy-related nausea. It is sometimes given to children to
treat intestinal worms. An extract of tamarind seeds is used in eye drops for dry eyes.

Tamarind contains ingredients that may contain laxative effects and some activ­
ity against certain fungi and bacteria. Specifically for dry eyes, it contains a chemi­
cal similar to mucin that is normally found in the eye (mucin helps protect and wet
the surface of the cornea).

- **Dosage:**

–– The appropriate dose of tamarind depends on several factors such as the user’s

age, health, and several other conditions. At this time, there is not enough
scientific information to determine an appropriate range of doses for tamarind.

- **Evidence** :

–– More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of tamarind for these uses.

- **Precautions** :

–– Tamarind is likely safe when used in food amounts. Caution in those with a

history of diabetes or hypoglycemia as tamarind might lower blood sugar
levels. There is a concern that it might interfere with blood sugar control.

- **Interactions** :


D. Shukhman and P. Bernstein


–– Taking tamarind with aspirin or Ibuprofen might increase how much

aspirin/ibuprofen the body absorbs. This could increase the amount of aspirin
in the body and might increase the chance of aspirin side effects.
###### **Taurine**

Taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonic acid) is an amino acid present in many tissues of
mammals. It plays an important role in heart, muscle, and nervous system function­
ing. Taurine is obtained through diet by eating meat, dairy, and seafood products. It
can also be made in the body from the amino acid cysteine.

Vegetarians may have lower plasma levels of taurine due to reduced intake
of meats.

- **Mechanism of Action:**

–– Taurine can be synthesized in the body by cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxyl­

ase. It circulates in free form and is not incorporated into proteins.
–– Taurine binds with cholesterol to form bile acid and protects the liver from

alcohol-induced steatosis and lipid peroxidation. With respect to skeletal
muscle, taurine facilitates Ca [2+] -dependent excitation–contraction processes,
helps regulate cellular volume, and assists in antioxidant defense from stress
responses. It also serves as a neurotransmitter and crosses the blood–brain
barrier by transporters.
–– Taurine reduces glutamate excitotoxicity through regulation of calcium ions

and mitochondrial energy metabolism.

- **Dosage:**

–– For congestive heart failure: 2–6 g of taurine per day in two or three

divided doses.

–– Hepatitis: 4 g of taurine three times daily for 6 weeks.
–– Nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy: 2 g of taurine daily for 6 months

has been used.

–– Muscle soreness after exercise: 2 g of taurine three times daily after meals

before exercise and continued 3 days after exercise.

- **Evidence:**

–– In vitro and in vivo, taurine demonstrated neuroprotective effects, reduced

diabetic-induced nephropathy, and improved glycemic control. In animal
models, chronic taurine intake reversed muscle dysfunction and atrophy and
decreased oxidative stress, and maternal taurine ingestion conferred protec­
tion against offspring developing adult hypertension.

173


–– In humans, consumption of taurine-rich foods has been associated with lower

cardiovascular risk. Evidence on whether taurine can improve exercise per­
formance is mixed and although taurine increased skeletal muscle in rodents,
these results have not been duplicated in humans.
–– Taurine has been associated with some adverse effects in animal models

including increased infection risk, delayed learning and memory, and when
coadministered with ethanol, drastic reductions in blood glucose resulting in
death. In humans, adverse reactions have been reported from excessive inges­
tion of energy drinks with taurine and caffeine, and in combination with
alcohol.

- **Precautions:**

–– Excessive taurine intake combined with alcohol and/or caffeine has caused

severe adverse effects, including death. One case study showed acute kidney
injury in a 7-year-old boy who ingested large quantities of both alcohol and
an energy drink containing taurine and caffeine. One case study showed
Tachycardia with death in a 28-year-old-man after drinking three cans of an
energy drink containing caffeine and taurine among other ingredients.

- **Interactions:**

–– Caution to those taking antihypertensive medications as Taurine may increase

the blood-pressure lowering effects of these drugs.
###### **Tea Tree Oil**

Tea tree oil is the essential oil distilled from *Melaleuca alternifolia,* a plant native to
Australia. It has been used in traditional medicine for its antiseptic and anti-­
inflammatory properties to treat various skin conditions and infections. It is also a
popular ingredient in skin and hair products.

- **Mechanism of Action:**

–– Terpinen-4-ol, a major constituent of tea tree oil, exhibited antimicrobial

activity against *Candida albicans*, *Escherichia coli*, *Staphylococcus aureus,*
and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* . Terpin-4-ol, alpha-terpineol, and alpha-pinene
also had antimicrobial effects against *Staphylococcus epidermidis* and
*Propionibacterium acnes* . Terpinen-4-ol suppressed inflammatory mediator
production by activating human monocytes. A tea tree oil concentrate pre­
vented influenza virus from entering the host cells by disturbing the normal
viral membrane fusion procedure. Other in vitro studies indicate that tea tree
oil has weak estrogenic and antiandrogenic properties that may alter the estro­
gen and androgen signaling pathways. At the same time, the notion that tea
tree oil has hormone-modulating properties has been challenged, and further
confirmatory research is needed. Skin irritation following use of tea tree oil is


-----

due to its auto-oxidation and formation of epoxide intermediates via arene-­
epoxidation reactions catalyzed by human cytochrome P450 enzymes.

- **Dosage:**

–– The recommended dose for acne is: Apply 5% gel to affected areas daily. The

recommended dose for nail fungus (Onychomycosis) is: Apply 100% solution
twice daily for 6 months.
–– The recommended dose for athlete’s foot is: Apply 10% cream topically twice

a day for 1 month OR apply 25% or 50% solution twice a day for 1 month.
–– Tea tree oil 100% solution can be applied to cuts, scrapes, burns, abrasions,

insect bites, and stings.

- **Evidence:**

–– In vitro studies suggest wide-spectrum antimicrobial, antiviral, antiprotozoal,

anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative properties. Animal studies also sug­
gest cytotoxic effects.
–– Preliminary studies in humans suggest various topical tea tree oil formula­

tions may help treat acne, athlete’s foot, fungal nail infections, histamine-­
induced skin inflammation, warts, cold sores, chalazia, and dermatitis.
However, additional studies are needed to confirm under what conditions
topical applications may be effective.

- **Precautions:**

–– Tea tree oil should not be taken orally, as severe side effects have occurred.

Side effects of tea tree oil may be local irritation and inflammation at the
application area.

- **Interactions** :

–– None well documented.
###### **Terminalia**

The bark of *Terminalia* *arjuna* has been used in India for more than 3000 years,
primarily as a heart remedy. An Indian physician named Vagbhata has been credited
as the first to use this product for heart conditions in the seventh century

A.D. People today use *T. arjuna* for disorders of the heart and blood vessels
(cardiovascular disease), including heart disease and related chest pain, high blood
pressure, and high cholesterol. It is also used as “a water pill,” and for earaches,
dysentery, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), diseases of the urinary tract, and to
increase sexual desire. Its useful phytoconstituents are: Triterpenoids, β-sitosterol,
flavonoids, and glycosides.

- **Mechanism of Action:**


-----

6 Tamarind– *Vitex agnus-castus*


175


–– Triterpenoids and flavonoids are considered to be responsible for its beneficial

antioxidant cardiovascular properties. The drug has shown promising effect
on ischemic cardiomyopathy. Bark stem of *T. arjuna* possesses diuretic, ino­
tropic, and chronotropic properties. The inotropic effect is considered to be
mediated through the high concentration of Ca [++] present in the plant.

- **Dosage:**

–– Clinical studies have been conducted in cardiovascular disorders using

*T. arjuna* bark extract at doses of 500 mg every 8 h for up to 3 months. Dosages
for other *Terminalia* species have not been clinically defined.

- **Evidence:**

–– In a recent study the anti-ischemic effect of bark powder was evaluated in 30

patients of stable angina/post-infarct angina (500 mg tds). The authors
observed that the mean anginal frequency decreased significantly, along with
a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP), improvement in ECG
changes, and reduction in plasma cortisol and serum cholesterol levels.

- **Precautions:**

–– Mild side effects like nausea, gastritis, headache, body ache, constipation, and

insomnia have been reported. No hematological, renal, or metabolic toxicity
has been reported even after more than 24 months of its administration.
However, high amounts of the plant extract should not be consumed, as it may
induce hepatotoxicity as well as hypothyroidism.

- **Interactions:**

–– Not much data is available to comment on the effect of *T. arjuna* on cyto­

chrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme. Results from a recent *in vitro* study indicate
that *T. arjuna* extracts contain constituents that can potently inhibit the activ­
ity of CYP1A
###### **Theacrine**

Theacrine (1,3,7,9-tetramethyluric acid) is a naturally occurring chemical that is
similar to caffeine. It is found in different types of tea and coffee, as well as in the
seeds of the Herrania and Theocrama plant species. It is also found in the tea plant
*Camellia assamica var. kucha*, which has been used traditionally to prolong life and
cure the common cold. People take theacrine by mouth for aging, the common cold,
fatigue, and mental performance. Theacrine is also added to pre-workout supple­
ments promoted for improving athletic performance.

- **Mechanism of Action:**


-----

176 D. Shukhman and P. Bernstein

–– Theacrine seems to affect the brain similar to caffeine. Like caffeine, thea­

crine stimulates the central nervous system at higher doses and decreases cen­
tral nervous system activity at lower doses. But unlike caffeine, theacrine does
not seem to affect blood pressure. Theacrine might also lessen liver damage
caused by stress and reduce pain and swelling.

- **Dosage:**

–– The appropriate dose of theacrine depends on several factors such as the

user’s age, health, and several other conditions. Theacrine has demonstrated
clinical safety and non-habituating effects in healthy humans over 8 weeks of
daily use at up to 300 mg/day. However, at this time there is not enough sci­
entific information to determine an appropriate range of doses for theacrine.

- **Evidence:**

–– Evidence shows findings that support clinical safety and non-habituating

neuro-energetic effects of Theacrine as seen in the TeaCrine™ study.

- **Precautions:**

–– Taken in notably low doses, theacrine could potentially carry a sedative effect

on a human body. This is also a notable side effect of caffeine, which has also
been suggested to sedate people when consumed in a very small dosage.

- **Interactions:**

–– Data from combination studies shows that the coadministration of caffeine

and theacrine produces a significant pharmacokinetic interaction, resulting in
enhanced theacrine exposure.
###### **Theaflavin**

Theaflavin (TF) is a chemical in black tea that is formed from fermentation of green
tea. It is the primary red pigments in black tea that possess several health benefits,
including fat-reducing and glucose-lowering capabilities and lifestyle-related dis­
ease prevention related to anti-obesity, anticancer, anti-atherosclerotic, anti-­
inflammatory, antiviral, antibacterial, anti-osteoporotic, and anti-dental caries
properties.

- **Mechanism of Action:**

–– Enzymes such as polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase are present in tea plant

leaves, which, for non-fermented tea, are either steamed, boiled, microwaved,
or electrically heated to inactivate endogenous oxidases. Black tea leaves are
tea leaves in which green tea catechins are oxidized by endogenous polyphe­
nol oxidase or peroxidase during the fermentation process.

- **Dosage:**

–– In the only clinical trial available, a theaflavin-enriched green tea extract

(375 mg) providing 75 mg of theaflavin reduced LDL and total cholesterol in
12 weeks. Still, there’s not enough clinical data to establish a safe and effec­
tive dosage for a general population.

- **Evidence:**

–– Theaflavins (TFs) are only present in low concentration in black tea. Several

meta-analyses have shown that the consumption of black tea results in signifi­
cant primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases by decreasing plasma low-­
density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and blood pressure as well as inversely
related to BMI. Zhao et al. reported that black tea extract inhibited the growth
of *P. gingivalis* (a bacteria in found in the oral cavity). It has been reported
that older women who drink tea exhibit higher Bone Mineral Density mea­
surements than women who do not drink tea. Based on animal and cellular
research, tea polyphenols (mainly EGCG and theaflavins) may play an impor­
tant role in delaying the onset and progression of Parkinson’s disease.

- **Precautions:**

–– No side effects of theaflavins were reported in the above clinical study, but

their long-term safety remains unknown in the lack of stronger clinical
evidence.

- **Interactions:**

–– No interactions of theaflavins were reported in the above clinical study, but

their long-term safety remains unknown in the lack of stronger clinical
evidence.
###### **Theanine**

L-theanine is a water-soluble amino acid found in green tea and mushrooms.
Purified L-theanine is available as an oral dietary supplement and is used for its
perceived antioxidant and relaxant effects. Several in vitro and animal studies sug­
gest lipid-lowering, neuroprotective, anti-obesity, and antitumor properties. Other
lab studies suggest L-theanine may affect levels of some neurotransmitters, prevent
beta-amyloid-induced cognitive dysfunction, and promote longevity in *C. elegans* .

- **Mechanism of Action:**

–– The underlying mechanism of L-theanine is to increase inhibitory neurotrans­

mitter levels as well as act directly to block overproduction of excitatory neu­
rotransmitters. L-theanine is a glutamic acid analog, a compound chemical
similar to the neurotransmitter glutamate.


-----

178 D. Shukhman and P. Bernstein

- **Dosage:**

–– Studies reporting an anxiolytic effect used single doses of theanine

200–250 mg. Short-term studies conducted for psychiatric disorders exam­
ined doses ranging from 240 to 400 mg per day in divided doses. Single-dose
studies evaluating effects on cognitive performance and mental alertness
combined caffeine with L-theanine doses of 97–100 mg.

- **Evidence:**

–– In a double-blind trial of adjunctive L-theanine for generalized anxiety disor­

der, there were no significant effects on anxiety although positive effects on
sleep were observed. Other small trials in patients with various conditions
also suggest improvements in sleep quality and possibly depression, anxiety,
and cognitive impairments although larger well-designed trials are needed.
Some trials evaluating L-theanine with caffeine suggest improvements in cog­
nitive performance although effects observed with caffeine alone in one study
were lost with concomitant L-theanine. When combined with antipsychotic
treatment, L-theanine alleviated anxiety and related symptoms, and improved
sleep in patients with schizophrenia.
–– Epidemiological data suggest green tea consumption may contribute to stroke

prevention, but it is unclear whether L-theanine alone may confer this benefit.
Preclinical studies suggest that L-theanine enhances chemotherapeutic effects
of doxorubicin and idarubicin and alleviates adverse effects from use of these

agents. However, patients undergoing chemotherapy should discuss the use of
L-theanine with their physicians because these effects are not based on clini­
cal trials, and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) in green tea reduces activity
of the chemotherapy drug bortezomib.

- **Precautions:**

–– Information regarding adverse reactions to theanine alone (versus combined

with caffeine, as in tea) is lacking. Clinical trials used small numbers of par­
ticipants and reported poorly on adverse events. One study among elderly
participants recorded a higher number of reported headaches among those
receiving four doses of theanine 250 mg.

- **Interactions:**

–– Lab experiments that suggest L-theanine may increase efficiency of chemo­

therapy drugs or reduce side effects have not been confirmed in humans.
–– Patients undergoing chemotherapy should discuss the use of L-theanine with

their physicians because safety data in cancer patients are lacking, and another
component found in green tea called epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)
reduces activity of the chemotherapy drug bortezomib.

###### **Thiamine**


179


Thiamine is vitamin B1. Thiamine is found in foods such as cereals, whole grains,
meat, nuts, beans, and peas. Thiamine is important in the breakdown of carbohy­
drates from foods into products needed by the body. Thiamine is used to treat or
prevent vitamin B1 deficiency. Thiamine injection is used to treat beriberi, a serious
condition caused by prolonged lack of vitamin B1. Thiamine taken by mouth (oral)
is available without a prescription. Injectable thiamine must be given by a health­
care professional.

- **Mechanism of Action:**

–– Thiamine combines with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the liver, kidneys,

and leukocytes to produce thiamine diphosphate. Thiamine diphosphate acts
as a coenzyme in carbohydrate metabolism, in transketolation reactions, and
in the utilization of hexose in the hexose-monophosphate shunt.

- **Dosage:**

–– Usual adult dose for thiamine deficiency: If dextrose administered: to patients

with marginal thiamine status, give 100 mg in each of the first few liters of IV
fluid to avoid precipitating heart failure. Usual adult dose for vitamin/mineral
supplementation: For beriberi, 10–20 mg IM three times daily for up to
2 weeks. Thereafter, use an oral therapeutic multivitamin preparation contain­
ing 5–10 mg thiamine daily for 1 month. 50–100 mg orally once a day usual
adult dose for Wernicke’s Encephalopathy: 100 mg IV as an initial dose fol­
lowed by 50–100 mg/day IM or IV until the patient is on a regular, balanced
diet. Usual pediatric dose for beriberi: 10–25 mg IM or IV daily (if critically
ill), or 10–50 mg orally every day for 2 weeks, then 5–10 mg orally daily for
1 month. If collapse occurs: 25 mg IV. Administer with caution. Usual pediat­
ric dose for thiamine deficiency: If dextrose administered to patients with
marginal thiamine status, give 100 mg in each of the first few liters of IV fluid
to avoid precipitating heart failure. Usual pediatric dose for vitamin/mineral
supplementation: Infants: 0.3–0.5 mg orally once a day; children: 0.5–1 mg
orally once a day.

- **Precautions:**

–– Thiamine supplementation is reported to be well-tolerated and safe to use. A

retrospective study on adverse effects of thiamine supplementation among
more than 300,000 patients found no serious side effects. However, some
commonly reported adverse effects include nausea, urticaria, lethargy, ataxia,
and impaired gut motility.

- **Interactions:**

–– Laboratory studies suggest that digoxin, a medication used to treat heart con­

ditions, may reduce the ability of heart cells to absorb and use vitamin B1.


-----

180


D. Shukhman and P. Bernstein

This may be particularly true when digoxin is combined with furosemide
(Lasix, a loop diuretic). Diuretics, particularly furosemide (Lasix), which
belongs to a class called loop diuretics, may reduce levels of vitamin B1 in the
body. It is possible that other diuretics may have the same effect. Preliminary
evidence suggests that some people taking phenytoin have lower levels of
thiamine in their blood, which may contribute to the side effects of the drug.
However, this is not true of all people who take phenytoin.

###### **Threonine**

Threonine is an amino acid. Amino acids are the building blocks the body uses to
make proteins. Threonine is used to treat various nervous system disorders includ­
ing spinal spasticity, multiple sclerosis, familial spastic paraparesis, and amyo­
trophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig’s disease).

- **Mechanism of Action:**

–– Threonine is changed in the body to a chemical called glycine. Glycine works

in the brain to reduce constant and unwanted spasticity.

- **Dosage:**

–– For a certain movement disorders due to spinal cord damage (spinal spastic­

ity): 6 g of threonine per day.

- **Evidence:**

–– Early research suggests that taking 1.5–2 g of threonine by mouth three times

daily might improve some symptoms in people with familial spastic parapa­
resis. Taking 2–4 g of threonine daily for up to 12 months does not seem to
slow the progression of ALS or reduce symptoms. There is also some evi­
dence that threonine might actually worsen lung function in people with ALS.

- **Precautions:**

–– There is some concern that threonine might decrease lung function in patients

with ALS. In one study, ALS patients taking 1 g of threonine four times per
day for 6 months had significantly reduced lung function compared to patients
who did not receive threonine.

- **Interactions:**

–– There is some concern that threonine might decrease how well a Namenda, a

medication used for Alzheimer’s disease works.

###### **Thuja**


181


*Thuja occidentalis*, commonly known as Arbor Vitae, is a medicinal plant that is
used as phytotherapy for acute and chronic infections of the upper respiratory tract.
It has also been used as an adjuvant to antibiotics for severe bacterial infections.

- **Mechanism of Action:**

–– *Thuja* is able to stimulate and costimulate cytokine and antibody production

as well as activate macrophages and other immunocompetent cells.

- **Dosage:**

–– The recommended daily dose of 36 mg is in the non-critical range.

- **Evidence:**

–– A 12 mg daily dose given simultaneously with antibiotic therapy for chronic

bronchitis showed a faster improvement in that group when compared to a
placebo. Patients with a common cold taking 6 mg of *Thuja* three times daily
demonstrated a therapeutic benefit for decreasing the duration of cold symp­
toms if taken as early as possible with symptom onset. A single dose of up to
75 mg or 1.25 mg per kilogram of bodyweight is considered safe in humans.

- **Precautions:**

–– This herb has not shown to cause any adverse side effects; however, symp­

toms of intoxication include gastrointestinal issues like nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhea. These extreme doses can lead to symptoms of liver and renal toxicity.

- **Interactions:**

–– Taking *Thuja* along with medications that increase the chance of having a

seizure can increase the risk of seizure. Anticonvulsants taken with *Thuja* can
increase the risk of seizure due to decreased effectiveness. *Thuja* can decrease
the effectiveness of medications taken to suppress the immune system.
###### **Thunder God Vine**

Thunder god vine, known as *Tripterygium wilfordii,* is a vine that grows in China. It
is primarily promoted to be used for rheumatoid arthritis.

- **Mechanism of Action:**

–– This vine contains chemicals that alter the way the immune system functions

in order to relieve swelling.

- **Dosage:**


-----

182


D. Shukhman and P. Bernstein


–– When taken for rheumatoid arthritis, some studies have shown that 60–350 mg

of the vine extract is safe if consumed orally.

- **Evidence:**

–– Some studies have shown that taking thunder god vine along with standard

treatment for rheumatoid arthritis has been shown to be more effective when
compared to the standard treatment alone for reducing inflammation and
swelling. This has led people to consume thunder god vine, while undergoing
standard rheumatoid arthritis treatment. Although more research needs to be
conducted, some studies are showing that thunder god vine can prove to be
beneficial for treating Crohn’s disease, kidney disorders, and psoriasis. Some
studies have even shown that thunder god vine is more effective for treating
rheumatoid arthritis than conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic
drugs (DMARDs).

- **Precautions:**

–– Thunder god vine can cause upset stomach, vomiting, diarrhea, kidney issues,

and missed menstrual periods. Thunder god vine can cause birth defects, so it
should be avoided when pregnant. Due to its immunosuppressive effects, this
vine should be avoided in patients who already have a weakened immune
system due to another medical condition. It should be avoided in people who
have osteoporosis as it can weaken bone strength. It can also alter sperm and
lead to a decrease in male fertility.

- **Interactions:**

–– Thunder god vine should not be taken with immunosuppressants and drugs

that are metabolized by the liver.
###### **Tiratricol**

Tiratricol (triiodothyroacetic acid) is a naturally occurring thyroid hormone that is
used to treat thyroid issues (i.e., cancer) and is also used as a supplement to increase
metabolic rate and decrease cellulite. In the United States, the FDA has now classi­
fied this to be an unapproved drug due to it being a powerful metabolite of T3 and
T4 thyroid hormones.

- **Mechanism of Action:**

–– It works by targeting thyroid receptors on effector organs that respond to thy­

roid hormone.

- **Dosage:**


-----

6 Tamarind– *Vitex agnus-castus*


183


–– 10–24 mg taken twice daily combined with levothyroxine has been shown to

be safe when treating thyroid cancer. Dosing information for other uses isn’t
readily available.

- **Evidence:**

–– Tiratricol is primarily effective for treating patients who have pituitary resis­

tance to thyroid hormone (Refetoff syndrome). In these patients, thyroid hor­
mone levels are elevated, but the thyroid-stimulating hormone levels are not
suppressed. Tiratricol in this case works to suppress thyroid-stimulating hor­
mone. Tiratricol has shown some effectiveness for treating thyroid cancer
when combined with levothyroxine. Tiratricol has also been used in trials
studying the treatment of Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, which is a rarer
disorder of brain development that causes moderate to severe intellectual dis­
ability along with movement issues. It has been shown to be likely ineffective
as a weight loss supplement and more research needs to be conducted to see
its impact on reducing cellulite. It is considered to be unsafe for both of
those uses.

- **Precautions:**

–– It can cause diarrhea, fatigue, and weakness. Tiratricol should be avoided in

pregnancy unless it is being used to treat thyroid problems in the developing
infant. It should be avoided in any person with heart issues, high blood pres­
sure, diabetes, liver disease, myxedema, and clotting issues.

- **Interactions:**

–– It should not be taken with other thyroid hormones unless specifically pre­

scribed. It should not be taken with cholestyramine since that can impact how
much tiratricol is absorbed. It should not be taken with antidiabetes drugs,
anticoagulant, and antiplatelet drugs.
###### **Tocotrienol**

The Vitamin E family is comprised of four tocotrienols (alpha, beta, gamma, and
delta). Tocotrienols has been used for high cholesterol, scars, familial dysautono­
mia, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. It is also being looked at as a potential
anti-osteoporotic agent in order to treat osteoporosis as well as a supplement to
protect against metabolic disease.

- **Mechanism of Action:**

–– Tocotrienol is potent antioxidant. It works to scavenge free radicals and pre­

vents oxidative damage on osteoblasts. This in term promotes the survival of
osteoblasts.


-----

184 D. Shukhman and P. Bernstein

- **Dosage:**

–– More research needs to be performed to ascertain the appropriate dosing

requirements based on the user’s health, age, and medical conditions. This
supplement has been safely used at a dose of up to 200 mg daily for 5 years.

- **Evidence:**

–– Current studies are examining the potential of using tocotrienol to protect

against metabolic diseases like diabetes and obesity. Due to its anti-­
inflammatory, antioxidant, and cell-signaling altering effects it is being used
to complement current treatment modalities for diabetes and obesity. More
studies need to be conducted in order to examine its usefulness in this sce­

nario. It has been shown to be possibly ineffective for treating high choles­
terol issues. There is insufficient evidence currently to examine its usefulness
in treating scars, familial dysautonomia, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

- **Precautions:**

–– Current breast feeding and pregnancy studies have not been completed, so

tocotrienol should be avoided in these scenarios. Diabetic patients should
monitor their sugar levels closely if taking tocotrienol.

- **Interactions:**

–– Tocotrienol may slow blood clotting, so it should be avoided with medications

that also slow down blood clotting because that can lead to bruising and
bleeding.
###### **Tormentil**

Tormentil is an herb that has been used in tea for people with upset stomachs and
diarrhea. Some studies are examining its role in stopping bleeding.

- **Mechanism of Action:**

–– Tormentil is composed of tannins that work to reduce inflammation and also

has a drying effect on tissues.

- **Dosage:**

–– More research needs to be conducted into appropriate dosing regimens for

tormentil. It is considered possibly safe when taken by mouth or applied
directly to the skin.

- **Evidence:**

–– Early studies have shown that taking tormentil three times daily has reduced

the duration of diarrhea in children with rotavirus. Other studies are showing


-----

6 Tamarind– *Vitex agnus-castus*


185


that tormentil can be beneficial in improving symptoms of ulcerative colitis.
Gargling with a tormentil mouth wash has been shown to shorten flare-ups of
lichen planus. Preliminary animal studies are being conducted to examine the
effects of tormentil on thrombosis due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxi­
dant properties.

- **Precautions:**

–– Side effects can include mild abdominal pain along with instances of heart

burn. There is not enough information to show if tormentil is safe to be taken
while pregnant or breast feeding.

- **Interactions:**

–– There is currently no significant information on the potential interactions of

tormentil with other substances.
###### **Tragacanth**

Tragacanth is a shrub that grows in certain areas of the Middle East. It has com­
monly been used to relieve symptoms of constipation and diarrhea.

- **Mechanism of Action:**

–– Tragacanth is able to stimulate the intestines of the user. **Dosage:** More

research needs to be conducted in order to ascertain the appropriate dosage
requirements for tragacanth; however, the dosage does depend on several
variables like the age, gender, and body weight of the user.

- **Evidence:**

–– More research needs to be done in order to see whether or not tragacanth is

useful in combatting diarrhea or constipation.

- **Precautions:**

–– Tragacanth can lead to a blockage of the intestinal tract if not consumed with

enough fluid. It has been shown to cause breathing problems in people who
are sensitive to quillaia bark.

- **Interactions:**

–– Since tragacanth is a thick gel, it can effect how certain medications are

absorbed when taken orally. For this reason, tragacanth should be consumed
30–60 min after consuming any medications.


-----

186
###### **Trypsin**


D. Shukhman and P. Bernstein


Trypsin is an enzyme that is naturally found in the small intestine. It is given to
people who lack this enzyme in order to aid in digestion. It is given in combination
with bromelain and rutin in order to treat osteoarthritis. It has also been used to

apply onto skin to remove dead tissue and promote healing.

- **Mechanism of Action:**

–– Trypsin is a digestive enzyme that is used to hydrolyze proteins.

- **Dosage:**

–– For treating osteoarthritis, two tablets containing 48 mg of trypsin have been

taken safely twice daily. For wound healing, more research needs to be con­
ducted to figure out how much is needed to be applied to the skin.

- **Evidence:**

–– Studies have shown that taking trypsin along with bromelain, rutin, and

diclofenac was beneficial in reducing pain in patients with TMJ
osteoarthritis.
–– Other studies have shown that due to its anti-inflammatory, anti-edematous,

fibrinolytic, anti-infective, and analgesic properties, trypsin is considered to
be a promising treatment for facilitating healing from traumatic injuries. It
was shown to promote a quicker recovery, while mitigating inflammatory
signs and symptoms.

- **Precautions:**

–– Most common side effect seen is pain and burning. **Interactions:** More

research needs to be conducted into determining the interactions that trypsin
has with other medications.
###### **Turmeric**

Turmeric is a spice that comes from a plant that is major source of a chemical called
polyphenol curcumin. It has been used in several oxidative and inflammatory condi­
tions, metabolic syndrome, arthritis, anxiety, and hyperlipidemia. People have also
taken it to enhance muscle recovery after soreness. Curcumin has a poor bioavail­
ability so in order to increase its bioavailability it can be combined with a substance
like piperine which is found in black pepper.

- **Mechanism of Action:**

–– The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects are the two major mechanisms

that explain the effects that turmeric has. It leads to an increase in serum


-----

6 Tamarind– *Vitex agnus-castus*


187


­antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase. It is able to scavenge free radicals,
while also modulating the activity of several key enzymes. Turmeric, specifi­
cally curcumin, has been shown to suppress inflammation by blocking NF-kB
that should be activated from varying inflammatory stimuli. Downregulating
NF-kB can aid in treating many diseases involved with inflammation like
Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and multiple sclerosis.

- **Dosage:**

–– For instances of high cholesterol, 1.4 g of turmeric has been safely divided

into two daily doses for up to 3 months. 1500 mg of turmeric divided into
three daily doses for 8 weeks has been safely taken for itching. 500 mg taken
four times daily has been done safely for 4–6 weeks for treating
osteoarthritis.

- **Evidence:**

–– Studies have shown that taking turmeric has been able to reduce total choles­

terol, LDL, and triglycerides in overweight people. Turmeric has been shown
to reduce pain in people taking it for osteoarthritis. Its effectiveness in reduc­
ing pain for this population is comparable to ibuprofen. Turmeric has also
been used to reduce itching in people who suffer from long-term kidney
disease.

- **Precautions:**

–– Some people can experience upset stomach, nausea, or dizziness. Turmeric is

likely unsafe when taken by mouth during pregnancy. Turmeric can worsen
gallbladder problems. It may slow down blood clotting. It can decrease blood
sugar in diabetic patients. It can worsen symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux
disease. Turmeric should be avoided in people with hormone-sensitive condi­
tions such as breast cancer.

- **Interactions:**

–– Avoid combining turmeric with medications that are metabolized by the liver

since turmeric can decrease how quickly the medication is broken down.
Taking turmeric with diabetes medication can cause a significant drop in
blood sugar. Taking turmeric with anticoagulants or antiplatelets can increase
bruising and bleeding. Turmeric can increase the side effects of sulfasalazine
when taken concurrently. Turmeric can increase the amount of tarolimus
available in the body. Turmeric can decrease how much talinolol is absorbed.

###### **Tylophora**


D. Shukhman and P. Bernstein


Tylophora is a plant that is found in tropical climates of Asia. People have been
primarily taking it in order to reduce allergic reactions and increase airflow
in asthma.

- **Mechanism of Action:**

–– Tylophora has some anti-inflammatory mechanism that works to increase air­

flow in a patient who has asthma. The specific mechanism is not known at
this time.

- **Dosage:**

–– More dosing studies need to be conducted; however, current dosing regimens

depend on the user’s age, weight, and gender.

- **Evidence:**

–– Studies showing the effectiveness that tylophora has on asthma has been

inconsistent. Some studies have shown that taking Tylophora daily for 6 days
has improved asthma symptoms for up to 8 weeks after treatment has begun.

- **Precautions:**

–– More research needs to be conducted on consuming Tylophora while preg­

nant or breast feeding. Some noted side effects are upset stomach, mouth
sores, and loss of taste for salt.

- **Interactions:**

–– More studies need to be conducted to confirm the interactions of Tylophora

with other medications.
###### **Tyrosine**

Tyrosine is an amino acid that the body can make from a precursor of phenylalanine.
It can be found in dairy products, meat, and fish. It is used to treat phenylketonuria
as well as neurologic and cognitive issues like attention deficit disorder.

- **Mechanism of Action:**

–– Tyrosine is used as a precursor in the synthesis of neurotransmitters like dopa­

mine and norepinephrine.

- **Dosage:**

–– For phenylketonuria the current regimen is 6 g of tyrosine per 100 g of pro­

tein. 150 mg/kg/day has been used safely for alertness.


-----

6 Tamarind– *Vitex agnus-castus*

- **Evidence:**


189


–– People with phenylketonuria are unable to produce their own tyrosine, lead­

ing to their own levels. These patients require a tyrosine supplementation.
–– Some studies are showing that tyrosine is effective in improving mental per­

formance and memory when put under stressful conditions like military train­
ing and sleep deprivation due to the effects of dopamine and norepinephrine.

- **Precautions:**

–– Some noted side effects are nausea, headache, fatigue, heartburn, and joint

pain. Tyrosine can worsen hyperthyroidism or Grave’s disease because it is
used to make thyroxine. Therefore, it should be avoided in these conditions.

- **Interactions:**

–– Tyrosine can decrease how much levodopa is absorbed, so it can decrease the

effectiveness of it. Tyrosine should be avoided with thyroid hormones since it
can lead to an increase of effects of thyroid hormones.
###### **Umckaloabo**

- **Mechanism of Action:**

–– Polyphenols (e.g., catechin) and 7-hydroxy-coumarins (e.g., umckalin), the

main constituents, have antimicrobial and immunomodulatory effects. Other
constituents include polymeric proanthocyanidins, monomeric flavan-3-ols,
phenolic acids, and gallic acid as well as small amounts of quercetin and
sitosterol-glucoside. *P. sidoides* extract increased natural killer cell formation,
tumor necrosis factor alpha, iNO, and interferon-beta release, and also dem­
onstrated anti-adhesive effects. In addition, the extract improved peripheral
blood phagocytes by enhancing oxidative burst and intracellular killing
in vitro.

–– Anti-HIV effects may occur through inhibiting the attachment of viral parti­

cles to target cells.

- **Dosage:**

–– For bronchitis: 30 drops (about 1.5 mL) three times daily or 10–30 mg tablets

three times daily of a specific extract of Umckaloabo for 7 days. In children
age 7–12 years, 20 drops of this extract three times daily. In children age
6 years or less, 10 drops of this extract three times daily. Some studies have
not found the tablet formulation to work in children. For sore throat and swol­
len tonsils in children age 6–10 years: 20 drops of a specific extract of
Umckaloabo three times daily (about 3 mL/day) for 7 days.

- **Evidence:**


-----

190


D. Shukhman and P. Bernstein


–– Data from clinical trials suggest effectiveness against acute bronchitis and

against rhinosinusitis. Meta-analyses suggest a significant decrease in bron­
chitis symptoms with *P. sidoides* use and benefit in pediatric respiratory tract
infections. An herbal preparation from *P. sidoides* root was found effective for
moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

- **Precautions:**

–– Allergic reactions. Gastrointestinal upset. Ear and labyrinth disorders.

Exacerbation of respiratory symptoms, fever, exanthema, psychomotor
unrest, and diarrhea in children have been reported.

- **Interactions:**

–– Due to its coumarin content, *P. sidoides* may increase the risk of bleeding.

However, coadministration with warfarin did not change the blood coagula­
tion values in animals. Clinical relevance has yet to be determined.
###### **Uva Ursi**

Uva ursi is a plant that has been used mostly for disorders of the urinary tract. It has
been used in cases of kidney, bladder, and urethra infections as well as kidney and
bladder stones.

- **Mechanism of Action:**

–– The active component of Uva ursi is hydroquinone glycosides, which is

believed to have anti-inflammatory and antiseptic activities that get excreted
in the urine.

- **Dosage:**

–– More research needs be conducted for appropriate dosing regimens; however,

dosing does depend on age, weight, and gender.

- **Evidence:**

–– Studies have not been able to show the effectiveness of Uva ursi in decreasing

the recurrence rate of UTIs. More studies need to be conducted in order to

examine the effectiveness of Uva ursi in combatting other urinary tract issues.

- **Precautions:**

–– In small doses, Uva ursi can cause nausea, vomiting, and upset stomach. In

large doses, it can lead to liver damage, eye issues, and discoloration of urine
with a greenish color. Uva ursi contains a chemical that can lead to thinning
of the retina and should be avoided in people who have thin retinas.

- **Interactions:**


-----

6 Tamarind– *Vitex agnus-castus*


191


–– Since Uva ursi can have a diuretic effect, it should be avoided taken at the

same time as lithium.
###### **Valerian**

Valerian is sold as a dietary supplement for calmness and to improve sleep quality.
It has a distinct odor that some may find unpleasant. In lab studies, valerian extract
appears to have calming effects related to the nervous system. Studies in humans
suggest valerian products have a modest effect on sleep quality.

- **Mechanism of Action:**

–– In vitro, valerian protects against lipid peroxidation, deoxyribose degradation,

and reactive oxygen species production. Iridoids, germacrane-type sesquiter­
penoids, and lignans in valerian are associated with neuroprotective effects.
Valerian constituents can also bind to various neurotransmitter receptors
implicated in circadian rhythms and anxiety such as serotonin receptors.

- **Dosage:**

–– For insomnia: 400–900 mg valerian extract up to 2 h before bedtime for as

long as 28 days, or Valerian extract 120 mg, with lemon balm extract 80 mg
three times daily for up to 30 days, or a combination product containing vale­
rian extract 187 mg plus hops extract 41.9 mg per tablet, two tablets at bed­
time for 28 days. **Evidence**

In vitro and animal models indicate that anxiolytic activity is due to valerenic acid
(VA) which could be inhibited by derivatives such as hydroxy-VA that do not modu­
late GABAA receptors. VA in animals inhibits the enzyme system responsible for
central catabolism of GABA, increasing GABA concentration and decreasing CNS
activity, and direct binding of this constituent to GABA-receptors has been demon­
strated. VA interaction with the GABAergic system has been noted to act in a man­
ner similar to that of benzodiazepines. Sesquiterpenes and valepotriates were
identified as having varying levels of antidepressant activity.

Chronic treatment of rodents with valepotriate-rich extract increased norepi­
nephrine and dopamine levels. Valerian exhibits antispasmodic and hypotensive
effects via potassium channel activation, which may be useful in gastrointestinal
and cardiovascular disorders. Valerian also exhibited a protective effect against
vasopressin-induced coronary spasm and pressor response, suggesting coronary and
systemic vasodilation.

In healthy volunteers, valerian was found to modulate intracortical facilitatory
circuits. Valerian iridoids may have choleretic activity and this may increase the risk
of gallstone formation, and therefore explain the increased risk for the development
of acute pancreatitis.

- **Precautions:**

–– Valerian might also cause sleepiness and drowsiness. Taking large amounts of

valerian along with alcohol, sedative medications such as benzodiazepines,
might cause too much sleepiness.

- **Interactions:**

–– Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) substrates. Some medications are changed

and broken down by the liver. Valerian might decrease how quickly the liver
breaks down some medications. Taking valerian along with some medications
that are broken down by the liver can increase the effects and side effects of
some medications.
###### **Vanadium**

Vanadium is the twenty-first most abundant element in the Earth’s crust and the
second- to most abundant transition metal in seawater. The element is ubiquitous
also in freshwater and nutrients. The average body load of a human individual
amounts to 1 mg. Since vanadate can be considered a close blueprint of phosphate
with respect to its built-up, vanadate likely takes over a regulatory function in meta­
bolic processes depending on phosphate. At common concentrations, vanadium is
non-toxic.

Vanadium is an over-the-counter mineral used for treating diabetes, low blood
sugar, high cholesterol, heart disease, tuberculosis, syphilis, anemia, and water
retention (edema); for improving athletic performance in weight training; and for
preventing cancer.

Potential health benefits of vanadium: May improve sensitivity to insulin in type
1 and 2 diabetes; may also lower cholesterol levels and blood pressure.

- **Mechanism of Action:**

–– The similarity between vanadate and phosphate accounts for the interplay

between vanadate and phosphate-dependent enzymes: phosphatases can be
inhibited, kinases activated.

- **Dosage:**

–– 50–100 mcg/day.

- **Evidence:**

–– It has been reported that in human beings, pharmacologic amounts of, i.e.,

10–100 times higher than the normal intake, affect cholesterol and triglycer­
ide metabolism, influence the erythrocyte shape, and stimulate hepatic glu­
cose oxidation and glycogen synthesis. Multidirectional studies on Vanadium
have shown that further analyses are still required for this element to be used
as a metallodrug in the fight against certain life-threatening diseases.

- **Precautions:**

–– Little is known about the safety of taking vanadium regularly. However,

there’s some evidence that vanadium may be harmful to people with certain
health conditions including disorders of the blood, respiratory system, and
immune system. In addition, some research suggests that excessive consump­
tion of vanadium may cause damage to the liver and/or kidneys.

- **Interactions** :

–– Vanadium may lower blood glucose and may also slow blood clotting.
###### **Vinpocetine**

Vinpocetine is a chemical that is made in a laboratory. It is sold as a prescription
drug in Germany. It has been used to enhance memory in Alzheimer’s and to prevent
disability following an ischemic stroke.

- **Mechanism of Action:**

–– Vinpocetine can increase the blood flow to the brain and therefore have a

neuroprotective effect. Vinpocetine has anti-inflammatory effects. It is able to
antagonize injury-induced vascular remodeling and diet-induced atheroscle­
rosis. It can also reduce the effect of cardiac remodeling.

- **Dosage:**

–– Vinpocetine has an excellent safety profile. 5–10 mg taken three times daily

has been used to treat memory and associated cognitive issues of Alzheimer’s.

- **Evidence:**

–– Vinpocetine has multiple actions. It is a vasodilator that also acts as an anti­

oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, and anti-remodeling agent.
–– Current studies are looking to show that it can provide benefit to people with

multifactorial cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases. In the short term,
vinpocetine has been shown to help improve cognitive skills in people with
Alzheimer’s or dementia. Vinpocetine inhibits the enzyme PDE1, therefore
blocking vasoconstriction, vascular remodeling, cardiac remodeling, and neu­
rotransmission. Vinpocetine blocks sodium channels, therefore preventing
cell toxicity and death. Vinpocetine also blocks IKK, therefore blocking
inflammation. **Precautions:** Some potential side effects are anxiety, sleep

­disturbance, headache, and flushing. Vinpocetine can increase the risk of mis­
carriage and should be avoided in pregnant people. Vinpocetine can increase
the risk of bleeding and should be avoided for people with a bleeding disorder.

- **Interactions:**

–– Vinpocetine can increase the risk of bleeding and bruising if taken with anti­

coagulant to antiplatelet.
###### ** Vitex agnus-castus**

*Vitex agnus-castus* is a shrub that is taken for menstrual cycle irregularities, premen­
strual syndrome, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and menopause.

- **Mechanism of Action:**

–– *Vitex agnus-castus* effects many hormones that regulate female reproductive

cycles. One proposed mechanism is that it causes a decrease in prolactin,
which reverses suppression of LH and increases progesterone.

- **Dosage:**

–– 20–40 mg has been safely used for up to 8 weeks to treat premenstrual dys­

phoric disorder. 4 mg has been taken three times daily for three menstrual
cycles to treat premenstrual syndrome.

- **Evidence:**

–– Studies have shown that *Vitex agnus-castus* is as effective as Prozac for com­

batting premenstrual dysphoric disorder. It is also more beneficial in treating
the other symptoms associated like breast tenderness, swelling, cramps, and
food cravings. *Vitex agnus-castus* can also lead to a relic of premenstrual syn­
drome symptoms like breast pain or tenderness as well as mood swings and
headache.

- **Precautions:**

–– Some people can have a change in menstrual flow when starting *Vitex agnus-­*

*castus* . More research needs to be conducted to determine the after profile of
this supplement in breastfeeding and pregnant people. *Vitex agnus-castus*
should be avoided in people with hormone-sensitive conditions like endome­
triosis, uterine fibroids, or breast cancer. *Vitex agnus-castus* can affect
Parkinson’s therapy due to similarities of the chemical components that are
used to treat Parkinson’s.

- **Interactions:**

–– Since *Vitex agnus-castus* alters the levels of hormones, it should be used cau­

tiously for people who are also taking contraceptive and estrogen-based

­medications. *Vitex agnus-castus* can lead to a significant decrease in how
effective antipsychotic and dopamine agonist medications are in combatting
their respective conditions.

##### **Chapter 7**
#### **Wallflower–Zinc**

**Caroline Varlotta and Gaurav Majmudar**
###### **Wallflower**

Wallflower (scientific name *Cheiranthus cheiri* ) is a plant native to southern Europe
commonly known as beeflower, gillyflower, keiri, and wallstock-gillofer. Medicinal
parts of the plant include the flower, seed, and any other above ground components.
Wallflower may be used as a diuretic to promote onset of the menstrual cycle, stimu­
lation of the heart (like digitalis or digoxin), and a treatment for constipation or
gallbladder and liver disease. This supplement has cardiac glycoside components
(like the ones found in diuretics) to control an irregular heartbeat, reduce backup of
blood in the body, increase blood flow to the kidneys, help excrete sodium, and
decrease peripheral edema.

The typical dose of wallflower is three to four cups of a mixture containing 2–3 g
of herbs and 100 mL of hot water, steeped for about 10 min and strained. Side
effects of wallflower supplementation include death if intravenous or injected,
arrhythmia, heart failure, and death.

Many drugs interact with wallflower including PhosLo (calcium acetate), Tums/
Rolaids extra strength (calcium carbonate), calcium chloride, Osteocit (calcium
citrate), calcium glubionate, calcium gluceptate, and calcium gluconate.
Additionally, many drugs when combined with wallflower can increase cardiac gly­
coside toxicity, including acetazolamide, azosemide, beclomethasone, betametha­
sone, budesonide, Symbicort (budesonide and formoterol combination), bumetanide,
cascara, chlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, cortisone, deflazacort, dexamethasone,
digitalix, docusate, senna, ethacrynic acid, etozolin, flunisolide, fluorometholone,

cinolone, trichlormethiazide, urea, and xipamide. Other supplements that may inter­
act with wallflower are also those that increase cardiac glycoside toxicity or increase
potassium depletion. This includes black hellebore, calotropis, motherwort, adonis,
digitalis, lily-of-the-valley, and squill, horsetail plant or licorice, stimulant laxative
herbs such as black root, cascara sagrada, castor oil, and senna, and mahuang [1].
###### **Wasabi**

Wasabi (scientific name *Wasabia japonica* ) is a plant native to the mountain river
valleys in Japan. It is commonly known as *Eutrema japonicum*, Japanese horserad­
ish, Korean wasabi, and Japanese spice. This supplement has no scientific uses, but
traditionally is used for its analgesic, antibacterial, antioxidant, and antiplatelet
properties. Wasabi may also be used in cancer to induce cell apoptosis, to preserve
food, treat gastric ulcers, and prevent melanoma and osteoporosis. There is no stan­
dard dosing recommended based on evidence and minimal reported adverse effects.
Topical wasabi should be used cautiously in patients using analgesics on the skin,
such as capsaicin. The most significant drug interaction is the increased risk of
bleeding with anticoagulation medications. Additionally, wasabi has adverse inter­
actions with non-steroidal anti-inflammatories and drugs metabolized by the liver.
Lastly, there may be some anabolic effects of wasabi on bone metabolism, and so
individuals taking SERMS***, hormonal agents, and bisphosphonates should use
this supplement with caution. Herbal interactions include garlic, ginseng, ginkgo,
and any other herb known to increase the risk of bleeding [2]. **Water Dock**

Great water dock (scientific name *Lapathi radix* ) is used worldwide to treat dysen­
tery, bacterial skin disorders, and enteritis. Its extract may produce solver nanopar­
ticles that may be used to protect food from spoiling when exposed to ultraviolet
light and may be used as an antioxidant. One article reported the dosage of water
dock to be 10 g in 100 mL of distilled water, heated to 80 °C for 30 min and mixed
with a magnetic stirrer. Next, the mixture was filtered three times and cooled at
room temperature. Adverse effects and drug or herbal interactions were not
reported [3].

###### **Water Hemlock**


201


Water hemlock (scientific names *Cicuta* and *Oenanthe* ) is one of the most poison­
ous plants in North America and the United Kingdom. The principal toxins include
cicutoxin and oenanthotoxin, which act as noncompetitive gamma-aminobutyric
acid antagonists in the central nervous system, resulting in seizure from neuronal
depolarization. Any amount of this supplement may result in severe toxicity. Other
clinical signs of water hemlock use include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia,
mydriasis, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac
arrhythmias. Water hemlock is not often intentionally used as a supplement, but is
commonly mistaken for other edible supplements, such as watercress, wild carrot,
wild ginseng, and pignut. Without adequate identification of ingestion and treat­
ment, individuals who ingest water hemlock are at risk of death [4].
###### **Watercress**

Watercress (scientific name *Nasturtium officinale* ) is a plant native to the
Mediterranean and areas of Asia commonly known as berro, garden cress, scurvy
grass, scrubby grass, and spoonwort. Similar to wasabi, this supplement has no
scientific uses. However, watercress was historically used against scurvy. Other tra­
ditional uses include abortion, acne, alopecia, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, anti-­
parasitic, chemoprotection, vitamin deficiencies, warts, and cough. The most used
dosage is 4–6 g of dry herb, 20–30 g of fresh herb, or 60–150 g of liquid dose in
juice or tea. The dosing is not evidence based. Possible side effects include derma­
titis and gastrointestinal irritation, especially in patients with ulcers. Chronic use
may lead to renal injury. Raw watercress should also be avoided, as it is commonly
infested with liver fluke parasites. Because one of the indications of watercress is to
induce abortion, this medication is toxic to fetus and should be avoided in preg­
nancy and breastfeeding.

This supplement has a high Vitamin K content and will interfere with anticoagu­
lants to increase the risk of bleeding. It also decreases oxidative metabolites of
acetaminophen circulating in the serum. Use of watercress with Chlorzoxaxone
may alter the effects of both due to reduced metabolism. Herbs with the adverse
effects of increased bleeding and those metabolized by the cytochrome P450
enzyme system should be avoided with watercress [5].

###### **Wheatgrass**


C. Varlotta and G. Majmudar


Wheatgrass (scientific name *Triticum aestivum* ) is a common plant supplement
popular in the United States, also known as bugday, breadwheat, cheng ping, com­
mon wheat, and wheat. Prior studies have demonstrated uses of wheatgrass in beta
thalassemia to reduce the number of required blood transfusions and in ulcerative
colitis. Wheatgrass has also been used in acne, blood flow disorders, inflammatory
disorders, weight loss, wound care, and as an antipyretic. Dosing for adults depends
on the indication. For supplementation in beta thalassemia and ulcerative colitis,
100 mL of wheatgrass juice should be consumed daily. Doses of 8–32 ounces may
also be used as a colonic or enema. Adverse effects include life-threatening allergic
reactions, likely due to its wheatberry component. Wheatgrass is consumed raw and
is grown in soils, and so it should be avoided in women who are pregnant or breast­
feeding. There is insufficient evidence of interactions of wheatgrass with other
drugs or herbs [6].
###### **Whey Protein**

Whey protein is a commonly used supplement with benefits well described in the
literature. Whey is the aqueous part of the milk and with processing, proteins such
as alpha lactalbumin, beta lactoglobulin, bovine serum albumin, and immunoglobu­
lins may be extracted. Among athletes, whey protein is the most widely used sup­
plement due to its vital role in increasing lean muscle mass, metabolism of
carbohydrates, and increased protein synthesis, resulting in higher physical perfor­
mance [7]. Dosage depends on an individual’s activity level and current body com­
position [8, 9]. Some studies propose a dose between 20 and 25 g per day of whey
protein is sufficient [10]. Whey protein is also antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal,
and has positive effects on immunomodulation [11]. Adverse effects include
increased presence of acne, dysfunctional gut microbiome, and impaired hepatore­
nal function [12–16]. A literature review concluded chronic use of high doses of
whey protein above 40 g per day had negative effects in sedentary individuals and
the dose of consumption is closely related to the presence or severity of adverse
effects [10, 11]. **White Horehound**

White horehound (scientific name *Marrubium vulgare* L.) is a gray-leaved herb
found in the Mediterranean and Northern Africa with features similar to the mint

plant. Distinct extracts of the white horehound can be used for different indications,
including expectorant for bronchitis in the form of cough drops and lozenges,

decreasing blood sugar in diabetics, analgesic, and antibacterial, especially against
methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* [17, 18]. Powders of *White Horehound*
are preferred over the liquid extracts because of higher stability and concentration
of bioactive components [19]. Dosage is not defined.
###### **White Lily**

White lily (scientific name *Lilium candidum* ) is a bulbous flower native to Northern
Iran. Historically, it was used for the treatment of burns, erythema, external inflam­
mation, and wound healing. The supplement is also known for its analgesic and
anti-inflammatory properties. One double-blinded placebo did conclude the use of
topical white lily when mixed with sesame oil resulted in statistically significant
decrease in Oswestry disability index and a numeric rating scale for pain compared
to placebo in chronic low back pain [20]. Dosages and adverse effects were not
reported. **White Mustard**

White mustard (scientific name *Sinapis alba* ) is a plant known for its important role
in plant defense against fungi and bacteria because of its high concentration of glu­
cosinolates. When a plant is injured, these glucosinolates are hydrolyzed to create
isothiocyanates (ITC), which are recognized for their benefits to humans, as a poly­
saccharide and source of protein [21]. The white mustard is a component of Mustard
Brand and Mustard Seed Flour, which are both natural preservatives of bread [22].
There is no specific dosing reported for white mustard specifically. Potential adverse
effects are due to the toxic compounds that may occur within extreme ingested
amounts of seeds, including impairment of long chain fatty acid transport, leading
to accumulation of triacylglycerols in the heart and other tissues [23]. Interactions
with drugs and other herbs were not reported. **White Pepper**

Pepper berries (scientific name *Piper nigrum* L.) undergo removal of pericarp,
resulting in dry seeds known as white pepper. This supplement has a milder taste
than black pepper and is a coveted seasoning for food preparation. The pepper ber­
ries are a tropical plant found in subtropical and tropical regions, including India,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Africa, and Brazil. The white pepper can be used to
make oleoresin, piperine, and essential oils [24].

###### **Wild Carrot**


C. Varlotta and G. Majmudar


Wild carrot is a supplement used to treat gout, indigestion, and heart disease. Some
individuals also use it as an aphrodisiac. There is no dosing reported. Potential
adverse effects of wild carrot include hypotension, drowsiness, nausea, and allergic
reaction with skin contact [25].
###### **Wild Cherry**

Wild cherry (scientific name *Prunus serotina* ) is a tree found in North America and
Canada. The bark of the wild cherry tree contains prussic acid, which calms the
coughing reflex. Early settlers of North America and the Native Americans used this
supplement as a cough syrup. Many cough medicines and lozenges still contain this
supplement. The typical dosage has not been established. Adverse effects include
headache, constipation, and gastrointestinal ulcers. Wild cherry should be used in
caution with the following drugs, as it may increase the serum levels of benzodiaz­
epines, amlodipine, atorvastatin, bepridil, cyclosporine, clorazepate, diltiazem,
estradiol, estrogens, many oral contraceptives, azole antifungal agents, lercanidip­
ine, midazolam, and nifedipine. It also may worsen benign prostatic hypertension
and narrow angle glaucoma. Wild cherry may increase sedative properties of St.
John’s wort, valerian, 5-HTP, and kava kava [26]. **Wild Indigo**

Wild Indigo (Scientific name *Baptisia* species) is a violet colored plant native to
North America commonly known as blue false indigo, blue wild indigo, horsefly
weed, indigo carmine, indigo weed, rattle bush, rattle weed, and wild indigo root.
This supplement has low toxicity levels, exacerbated when used in combination
with *Baptisia tinctoria* root, Echinaca pallida purpurca root, and *Thuja occidentalis* .
Uses of wild indigo have included antiviral, antiemetic, immunomodulating, and as
a laxative. There is no standard dosing. It should not be taken with antiviral drugs or
immunosuppressants. According to the evidence, benefits of this supplement do not
outweigh the risk [27].

###### **Wild Yam**


205


Wild yam (scientific name *Dioscorea villosa* ) is a plant with an active portion in the
root, diosgenin, a steroid like substance that was previously used in oral contracep­
tives, as it is similar to progesterone. As a supplement, wild yam may be used to
resolve menopausal symptoms, such as cramps and rheumatic conditions. There is
no reported dosage. Adverse effects of wild yam include changes in menstruation.
Drugs that may interact with this supplement include all oral contraceptives and
estrogens [28].
###### **Willow Bark**

Willow bark (scientific name *Salix* ) is a plant found in the Mediterranean region
usually used in weight loss and to treat fever and inflammatory conditions. The
antipyretic and anti-inflammatory characteristics are likely due to the salicin con­
tent, which is a salicylate glycoside. Multiple studies support willow bark is effec­
tive in treating low back pain, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis [29–31]. The
mechanism of willow bark in weight loss is theorized to be due to pain relief result­
ing in increased mobility, exercise performance, and energy consumption [32–34].

This supplement should be avoided during breastfeeding or children because it
contains salicylic acid, which can induce Reye’s syndrome. Because willow bark
contains salicin, those allergic to aspirin and salicylic acid should not use this sup­
plement. Other warnings have been issues regarding the use of willow bark with
gastritis, stomach ulcers, diabetes, asthma, or hemophilia. Willow bark may also
interact with anticoagulants, beta blockers, and diuretics but changing their effec­
tiveness, and increasing the risk of stomach bleeding if combined with NSAIDs

[35]. Dosage was not reported [36]. **Wintergreen**

Wintergreen is used for headaches, flatulence, and fever. Usually, wintergreen is
found in food or candy. It has also been cited to treat low back pain when formulated
as an oil [37]. Possible side effects of wintergreen include lack of appetite, lethargy,
and gastrointestinal irritation. Wintergreen interacts with a variety of drugs, includ­
ing etodolac, ibuprofen, ketorolac, methotrexate, metformin, morphine, naproxen,
nitrofurantoin, penicillin, tramadol, valacyclovir, and zidovudine. If taken with
aspirin, antithrombin III, or other blood thinners, then the individual will have sig­
nificant increased risk of bleeding. This supplement also may worsen gastrointesti­
nal inflammatory diseases and trigger salicylate allergies [38]. Dosages are not
reported.

###### **Wormseed**


C. Varlotta and G. Majmudar


Wormseed (scientific name *Chenopodium ambrosioides* ) is a plant native to Central
America, commonly known as Chenopodium, feather geranium, goosefoot,
Jerusalem oak, and Jesuit tea. The main use of wormseed is as an anthelmintic to
treat worm infestation. There is no standard dosing. Potential adverse effects include
muscle twitching, stupor, and renal injury. Drug interactions include all anticonvul­
sants and acetazolamide. No known herbal supplements interact adversely with
wormseed [39].
###### **Wormwood**

Wormwood (scientific name *Artemisia absinthium* ) is a tonic historically used to
treat worm infestation. Since its discovery, wormwood is also used for liver pathol­
ogy, bloating, appetite stimulation, and anemia. In Germany, wormwood is approved
to treat mild gastrointestinal complaints and is commonly dosed at 1–2 mL of liquid
extract two to three times daily. Adverse effects include worsening gastric or duode­
nal ulcers, headache, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Wormwood should not be
taken with anticonvulsant medications and may impact absorption of iron supple­
ments and ascorbic acid. One case study has shown wormwood taken concurrently
with warfarin can cause an elevated INR and bleeding [39, 40]. **Yarrow**

Yarrow (scientific name *Achillea millefolium* ) is a plant found in Asia, Europe, and
North America traditionally used for wound care. It may commonly be referred to
as bloodwort, milfoil, nosebleed, one man’s pepper, sanguinary, soldier’s wound­
wort, stanchgrass, and thousand-leaf. This supplement is used in respiratory com­
plaints, gastrointestinal issues, urinary tract infections, bleeding disorders, wound
care to promote wound healing, and superficial skin infections. There are animal
studies demonstrating effects on contraception and antitumor factors as well. There
is no standard reported dosing, but common doses include: fluid extract 1–2 mL
three times per day (in a 1:1 dilution of 25% of alcohol), 2–4 g three times a day
drank as tea, as a tincture of 2–4 mL three times daily (1:5 dilution in 45% alcohol),
or as a topical sitz bath using 100 g of herbs in five gallons of hot water. Adverse
effects of yarrow include contact allergic reactions, gastrointestinal ulcers, and
amplification of diuretic and sedative medications. It should be avoided in preg­
nancy as it has shown to decrease fetal weight in high doses. There are no drug or
supplement interactions reported, but because yarrow may increase the risk of
bleeding and should be avoided with anticoagulants or antiplatelets [41, 42].

###### **Yew**


207


Yew (scientific name *Taxus baccata* ) is a 40- to 50-foot tall tree which is used as an
anticancer substance, taxol, which has become a drug used to treat breast cancer.
The medicinal parts are the leaves, branches, and twig tips. There is no dosage
reported [43].
###### **Yucca**

Yucca is a plant native to North America, Central America, and the Caribbean. It is
commonly confused with cassava ( *Manihot esculenta* ), which may also be called
yucca in some regions. Other names for yucca include Adam’s needle, alexin, and
resveratrol. Evidence demonstrates blending yucca and soapbark ( *Quillaja sapo­*
*naria* ) may reduce cholesterol levels. Other uses of yucca include antifungal, anti­
viral, anti-inflammatory, and as an adjunctive to cancer treatments. There is no
standard dosing. There are no reported drug interactions [44]. **Zinc**

Zinc is the second most abundant trace metal in the human body after iron. It is an
essential part of protein structure and function, as it comprises ~750 zinc-finger
transcription factors for gene transcription and 2000 enzymes. Therefore, cellular
processes of the human body essential in growth and development rely on zinc.
There is little free zinc circulating throughout the human body. Most zinc remains
bound to proteins, such as albumin the serum and metallothionein intracellularly.
Zinc also plays a role as an antiviral agent and can be used to increase immunity in
those with zinc deficiency and can be used to inhibit viral replication.

Reduced dietary zinc intake increased. Alcohol intake and ingestion of dietary
phytate (a natural chelator of zinc in corn, rice, and cereals) may lead to zinc defi­
ciency [45]. Elderly individuals are more susceptible to zinc deficiency, contribut­
ing to their increased likelihood of acquiring viral infection [46]. Zinc deficiency
may also lead to type 1 diabetes, autoimmune disease, growth retardation, taste
disturbances, and skin disorders.

Polaprezinc is a common supplement consisting of zinc and l-carnosine dosed at
34 mg/150 g zinc. Zinc toxicity may be acute or chronic in presentation. Toxicity
will present as epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, abdominal cramps,
diarrhea, and headaches. There may also be copper deficiency, altered iron function,
impaired immune response, and decreased serum cholesterol with zinc toxicity [47].

###### **Ziziphus**


C. Varlotta and G. Majmudar


Ziziphus (commonly known as sour date) is a fruit used in Chinese medicine as a
sedative to relieve irritability and aid in sleep. In combination with other herbs, such
as in the LZComplex3, it may improve mood and performance for individuals with
anxiety. Dosage of LZComplex3 is one or two tablets prior to sleep. In one trial, the
safety efficacy was similar to placebo and there were mild gastrointestinal adverse
events reported [48].
