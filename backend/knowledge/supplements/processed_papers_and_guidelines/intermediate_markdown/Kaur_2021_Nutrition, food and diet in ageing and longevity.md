Rapidly changing demographics worldwide towards increased proportion of the
elderly in the population and increased life-expectancy have brought the issues,
such as “why we grow old”, “how we grow old”, “how long can we live”, “how to
maintain health”, “how to prevent and treat diseases in old age”, “what are the
future perspectives for healthy ageing and longevity” and so on, in the centre stage
of scientific, social, political, and economic arena. Although the descriptive aspects
of ageing are now well established at the level of species, populations, individuals,
and within an individual at the tissue, cell and molecular levels, the implications of
such detailed understanding with respect to the aim of achieving healthy ageing and
longevity are ever-changing and challenging issues. This continuing success of
gerontology, and especially of biogerontology, is attracting the attention of both the
well established academicians and the younger generation of students and
researchers in biology, medicine, bioinformatics, bioeconomy, sports science, and
nutritional sciences, along with sociologists, psychologists, politicians, public
health experts, and health-care industry including cosmeceutical-, food-, and
lifestyle-industry. Books in this series will cover the topics related to the issues of
healthy ageing and longevity. This series will provide not only the exhaustive
reviews of the established body of knowledge, but also will give a critical
evaluation of the ongoing research and development with respect to theoretical and
evidence-based practical and ethical aspects of interventions towards maintaining,
recovering and enhancing health and longevity.

#### Preface: Nutrition, Food and Diet

Nutrition, food and diet are the terms often used casually and uncritically as
overlapping ones. Whereas nutrition generally refers to the macro- and
micro-nutrients essential for health and survival, it is normally consumed as animalor plant-based foods. Even more importantly, there are crucial cultural dimensions
which transform nutritional components through various methods of cooking and
preservation and then identify the resulting food as a specific diet. Moreover, in the
background of all this lurks the evolutionary history of Homo sapiens from being
hunter–gatherers to becoming agriculturists and to the present state of becoming the
modern consumers of highly processed food products and overeating behaviours.
This book is a multi-chapter compilation reviewing and discussing the present state
of information and knowledge about those aspects.
The contents of the book are divided into five parts: (1) the first part “Nutritional
components”, explains the role of macro- and micro-nutrients including proteins,
carbohydrates, fats and oils to pro- and prebiotics, and hormetins, along with an
article on the evolutionary biology of nutrition and its implications in the modern
lifestyle; (2) the second part “Food for health” discusses various types of food in
relation to their claimed health benefits from animal- and plant-based food, fermented foods, anti-inflammatory foods, milk and other dairy products, nutraceuticals and functional foods, and foods for brain health; (3) the third part “Diet and
culture” discusses the general principles of healthy dietary patterns, nutritional
regulation of ageing and longevity, circadian rhythms and diet, dietary principles
and practice according to the traditional Chinese medicine, Indian traditional diet,
and ketogenic diet; (4) the fourth part “Nutritional and dietary interventions” critically reviews various social and clinical approaches through history, including
fasting and calorie restriction, molecular mimetics of calorie restriction,
nutrition-based senolytic compounds, natural and synthetic short peptides and
specific herb-based chemicals, along with providing some practical and cautionary
advice for having the optimal nutrition, and managing the problems related to
obesity. Finally, in the fifth part, a concluding chapter by the editors recapitulates
and summarizes the central messages and suggestions emerging from all other
chapters included in this book.

vi Preface: Nutrition, Food and Diet

Prevalence of malnutrition and under-nutrition increases in old age due to both
physiological changes in appetite, digestion and metabolism, and other factors such
as decreased physical activity, cognitive decline, and multiple co-morbidities. Thus,
making right choices of food, based on the scientific information and within a
cultural context, are the most effective strategies to enhance individual health and
public health. Wholesome foods consumed with the hormetic principles of pleasure,
moderation, and variety may be the mantra for healthy ageing and longevity. This
book provides reviews and critical analyses of the past, present, and futuristic
research on “Nutrition, Food and Diet” in the context of human health, well-being,
ageing, age-related diseases, lifespan, and healthspan.

#### **Dietary Proteins: Functions, Health** **Benefits and Healthy Aging**

**Khetan Shevkani and Shivani Chourasia**

**Abstract** Dietary proteins are the source of indispensable, dispensable and functional amino acids essential for the synthesis of body proteins and the regulation of
physiological processes. They also are beneficial in alleviating lifestyle and/or agerelated health problems (e.g. loss of muscle mass and strength, obesity/sarcopenic
obesity, dyslipidaemia, bone mineral loss and type-2 diabetes) because of their
roles in the promotion of muscle protein synthesis, satiation, optimisation of growth
factors, inhibition of inflammatory substances and regulation of major pathways of
metabolism, though protein-quantity and quality are major determinants of nutritional and disease-preventing effects. The intake of high quality proteins in adequate
amounts together with healthy lifestyle can contribute to healthy aging through maintenance of muscle mass and/or enhanced ability of recovering from diseases, while
proteins from legumes/pulses and milk (e.g. whey proteins) may benefit elderly
people by reducing the risk of coronary artery diseases, obesity, bone density loss,
type-2 diabetes and associated morbidities/mortalities. This chapter discusses health
benefits of increased intake of dietary proteins in elderly people and provides an
overview of protein quality and methods for evaluating the same. The chapter also
outlines functions of dietary proteins and compares animal and plant proteins for
their quality and health benefitting effects.

###### **1.1 Introduction**

Proteins are complex nitrogenous compounds that are made up of amino acids linked
through peptide bonds. At the elemental level, they contain 50–55% carbon, 20–
25% oxygen, 12–19% nitrogen, 6–7% hydrogen and 0.2–3.0% sulphur (Damodaran
2017). Proteins are considered as the most fundamental component of body. They are
the second most abundant constituent in human body, next only to water. A healthy K. Shevkani ( B ) · S. Chourasia

man weighing 70 kg contains around 11 kg (approximately 16%) proteins in the body
against around 10 kg (approximately 14%) in a woman of the same weight. About 45–
50% of total body protein is present in muscles, 15–20% in bones, 10–15% in skin and
the remaining portion in other tissues. Thousands different types of proteins occur in
human body, which are involved in almost all metabolic and physiological processes.
However, human body does not have mechanisms to store proteins. Therefore, a
constant supply of a certain minimum amount of proteins through diet is essential
for maintaining growth and other metabolic processes. Normal healthy adults are
recommendedtotake0.8gqualityproteinsperkgbodyweightperdaytomeetprotein
requirements (Wolfe et al. 2017). Although body proteins differ considerably from
proteins present in foods for chemical/biochemical and structural characteristics,
dietary proteins provide amino acids and nitrogen that are utilized for synthesis of
body proteins and other compounds vital for survival.
Milk, meat, fish, eggs, pulses/legumes and cereals are major sources of dietary
proteins. These foods differ widely for protein content and characteristics. Protein
content of selected foods are shown in Table 1.1. In general, animal foods (milk,
egg, fish and meat) are considered as a source of high-quality proteins due to
their ‘completeness’ in the context of amino acid composition and the absence of
anti-nutritional constituents. However, plant foods, nowadays, are being promoted
because of 1) the absence of cholesterol, 2) the presence of health-beneficial bioactive compounds (e.g. lectins, enzyme inhibitors, phytosterols, saponins, phenolic
compounds, dietary fibre, etc.), and 3) their roles in ensuring sustainable agriculture
and food security (Shevkani et al. 2015; Singh et al. 2017; Lonnie et al. 2018; Magrini
et al. 2018; Bessada et al. 2019; Shevkani et al. 2021).
Dietary proteins also can be beneficial in alleviating lifestyle and age-related
disorders/diseases and reducing morbidity/mortality in elderly people. Increased
intake of dietary proteins was reported beneficial in the maintenance of muscle mass
and the prevention of sarcopenia (Houstan et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2020), obesity
(Weigle et al. 2005; Millward et al. 2008; Zhou et al. 2014), bone demineralisation/osteoporosis (Thorpe et al. 2008; Shams-White et al. 2017; Groenendijk et al.
2019) and dyslipidaemia (Santesso et al. 2012; Hosomi et al. 2013). Also, a high
protein diet caused about 28% reduction in mortality in elderly people of more than
65 years of age (Levine et al. 2014). This chapter discusses the health-benefitting
effects of increased intake of dietary proteins in elderly people and provides an
overview of protein quality and methods for evaluating the same. In addition, the
chapter also outlines functions of dietary proteins and compares animal and plant
proteins for their quality and health benefits.

###### **1.2 Proteins as a Source of Amino Acids**

Dietary proteins are the source of amino acids and nitrogen required in body for
synthesis/formation of tissues/organs, enzymes, hormones and cell-specific physiologically important low molecular weight substances e.g. nitric oxide, glutathione,
carnitine, carnosine, serotonin, melanin, melatonin, etc. (Blachier et al. 2011; Kong
et al. 2012; Wu 2013). Although hundreds of amino acids occur in nature, only 20–21
are involved in synthesis of proteins in human body and in most other forms of life.
Structurally, amino acids are composed of a carbon atom linked covalently with a


-----

hydrogen atom, an amine group, a carboxyl group and an alkyl group (also referred
to as amino acid side chain). Different amino acids differ for the side chain, the characteristics of which decide physicochemical properties and reactivity of amino acid
as well as properties of proteins. Based on the characteristics of side chains, amino
acids are categorized in to acidic (aspartic acid and glutamic acid), basic (arginine,
histidine and lysine), polar uncharged (serine, threonine, asparagine, glutamine and
cysteine), aliphatic and nonpolar (alanine, isoleucine, leucine, valine, glycine, proline
and methionine) and aromatic and nonpolar amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine and
tryptophan), though a few (e.g. glycine, histidine and cysteine) do not fit perfectly
into a particular group and their assignments to a particular group is not considered
absolute (Nelson and Cox 2013; Ustunol 2015).
On the basis of nutritional properties, amino acids are grouped as essential (indispensable), non-essential (dispensable) and conditionally-essential (semiessential/conditionally-indispensable) amino acids (Fig. 1.1). Although human body
needs all 21 amino acids for proper functioning, growth and maintenance, only 9
have been classified as indispensable amino acids as these cannot be synthesized
endogenously in human body. Some amino acids (arginine, cysteine, glutamine,
glycine, proline and tyrosine) are conditionally-indispensable, the human body is
unable to synthesize them endogenously under certain physiological conditions (e.g.
infancy, pregnancy, lactation, injury, burn, infections or diseased conditions). Amino
acids have also been classified as functional amino acids based on their specific
functions in the body. Functional amino acids are defined as the amino acids that
participate in regulation of key metabolic pathways involved in growth, development,
lactation, reproduction and overall health of organisms (Wu 2010, 2013). Functional amino acids contribute to and/or play crucial roles in 1) intestine health, 2)
foetal survival/development, 3) immunity, 4) neurological functions and synthesis
of neurotransmitters, 5) secretion of insulin, 6) activation of taste receptors and 7)
recovery from injury (Li et al. 2007; Brosnan and Brosnan 2013; Rezaei et al. 2013;
Wu et al. 2017). For example, dietary glutamate, glutamine and aspartate serve as
major metabolic fuels for enterocytes and small intestine (Rezaei et al. 2013). Glutamate, glutamine, arginine and glycine also can contribute to intestinal health through
enhancing villus-height, width and surface area, mucosal protein synthesis, activity
of antioxidant enzymes (e.g. catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase) in small intestine and health of enterocytes (Jiao et al. 2015; Yi et al. 2018). In
addition, glutamine is also involved in providing ATPs to macrophages and lymphocytes and serves as an exclusive source of energy for arteries in post-absorptive
state (Li et al. 2007). Further, arginine and glutamine play important functions in
placental metabolism and supplementation of these amino acids can help enhance
foetalsurvivalandgrowth(Wuetal. 2017).Selenocystein,amorerecentlydiscovered
21 [st] proteinogenic amino acid, also performs important functions in human body. It is
involved in the regulation of thyroid metabolism, removal of reactive oxygen species
and protection of cells from oxidative damage, maintenance of cellular redox balance,
regulation of signalling cascades, promotion of protein folding and maintenance of
selenium homeostasis (Schmidt and Simonovi´c 2012).

Amino acids also have roles in healthy aging and longevity. Amongst different
indispensable amino acids, branched chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and
valine) have contributory roles in healthy aging and longevity. They do not undergo
metabolism in liver, hence get circulated almost immediately after absorption and
becomeavailabletothebody(Holeˇcek 2018;Datoetal. 2019).D’Antonaetal.(2010)
reported increased average lifespan and improved performance/endurance for male
mice fed on branched chain amino acids diets. The effect was observed in associ
ation with an increased mitochondrial biogenesis, sirtuin-1 expression and reduced
oxidative damage in cardiac and skeletal muscles (D’Antona et al. 2010). In another
study on 24 elderly men (average age 74.3 years), co-ingestion of 2.5 g leucine
with 20 g casein proteins led to 22% higher muscle protein synthesis rate compared
with ingestion of casein alone (Wall et al. 2013). Improvements in nutritional status,
cognitive performance, general health, muscle mass, strength and performance were
also reported as a result of improved mitochondria functions in malnourished elderly
people given branched chain amino acids (Buondonno et al. 2020). Fujita and Volpi
(2006) attributed stimulatory effect of these amino acids on muscle protein synthesis
in older individuals to the initiation of mRNA translation. Also, mammalian target
of rapamycin (mTOR) Complex 1 (a key pathway in amino acid induced anabolic
responses) was reported to be sensitive for leucine, while muscles in older adults
required increasing concentrations of this amino acids for maintaining anabolic
responses through the mTOR pathway (Dillon 2013). Furthermore, leucine, also
contributed to health-span by improving glucose metabolism through promoting
glucose uptake in muscles via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase C
pathways (Nishitani et al. 2002) and reducing body weight by increasing leptin
secretion and decreasing food intake (Valerio et al. 2011). However, branched chain
amino acids may also have negative health implications owing to their involvement in the promotion of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Zhenyukh et al. 2017) as well as the ability to
increase excitotoxicity in cortical neurons in brain (Contrusciere et al. 2010). Conditionally indispensable amino acids contributing to health-span include glutamine
and arginine. Glutamine has important roles in the maintenance of normal skeletal
muscle function and neuronal physiology owing to its ability of controlling heatshock responses (Leite et al. 2016), while arginine can contribute to reduced risk of
endothelial dysfunction-associated cardiovascular risk with aging (Heffernan et al.
2010; Dato et al. 2019).
###### **1.3 Digestion and Absorption of Proteins**

Proteins ingested through food are required to be digested before being absorbed and
utilized in the body. Digestion involves breakdown of protein molecules to constituting amino acids. Proteins in liquid foods pass through the mouth almost unaltered (Loveday 2019). Semisolid and solid foods, however, undergo physicochemical
changes during mastication, though most of protein digestion occurs in stomach and


-----

1 Dietary Proteins: Functions, Health Benefits and Healthy Aging 11

small intestine. In the stomach, proteins get mixed with gastric acid and pepsinogen
(inactive form of pepsin also called as zymogen). The acid in the stomach transforms
pepsinogen to active form (pepsin) and makes proteins susceptible to pepsinolysis by
partially denaturating (unravelling) them. Pepsin acts on acid denatured proteins and
catalyse hydrolysis of peptide bond next to phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine
residues. The partially digested proteins/polypeptides in *chyme* (stomach contents)
then enters the duodenum, where they trigger the release of hormone cholecystokinin.
The hormone reaches pancreas through blood stream and makes the organ to release
alkaline secretions with proteolytic enzymes including trypsin, chymotrypsin and
pancreatin in their inactive forms that get activated under specific conditions. The
enzymes in pancreatic secretions selectively hydrolyse bonds in polypeptides, shorter
peptides or oligopeptides to liberate amino acids and small peptides. These amino
acids and small peptides are absorbed by the absorptive cells of the small intestine
which then break down small peptides (dipeptides and tripeptides) to amino acids
and transfer them into blood capillaries. Eventually, absorbed amino acids are metabolized by the liver for synthesising body proteins, to be used as an energy source,
converting to sugars or fats and/or releasing into the blood stream (Byrd-Bredbenner
et al. 2009).
Human digestive system is very effective in achieving breakdown of proteins
to amino acids and small peptides, though some proteins and peptides may resist
complete digestion in the small intestine. Such proteins and peptides eventually
reach the large intestine where gut microflora ferment them to short chain fatty acids
(SCFA) or amines through deamination or decarboxylation, respectively (Fan et al.
2015; Rios-Covian et al. 2020). Acetates, propionates and butyrates are major SCFA
produced in the gut. These SCFA exert beneficial effects on host through maintaining
acidic pH in the gut, fuelling epithelial cells for mucin production, increasing colonic
blood flow and preventing the growth of abnormal colonic cells (Rios-Covian et al.
2016). The SCFA that are not utilized in colon may exert beneficial effects against
diet-induced obesity and hyperlipidaemia by interfering with carbohydrate and lipid
metabolism after reaching liver via hepatic vein (Rios-Covian et al. 2016). In addition
to acetates, propionates and butyrates, branched-SCFA e.g. isobutyric, isovaleric,
and 2-methylbutyric acids are also produced in gut as a result of fermentation of
amino acids (e.g. valine, leucine and isoleucine) by *Bacteroides* and *Clostridium*
spp. (Aguirre et al. 2016; Rios-Covian et al. 2020). Therefore, the presence of these
SCFA in stools is considered as the indication of the fermentation of proteins in gut.
However, the fermentation of indigested proteins also may have some negative effect
on gut health as some products with potential harmful effects on colon epithelium
(e.g. biogenic amines, sulphides, ammonia, cresols, phenol, etc.) are also produced
during fermentation (Nie et al. 2018; Rios-Covian et al. 2020).

###### **1.4 Functions of Dietary Proteins**

Proteins are involved in nearly each physiological processes in the body. They function as transport proteins (e.g. haemoglobin and ferritin that are involved in transport
of oxygen and Fe, respectively), structural proteins (e.g. elastin and collagen function
to support the body), contractile proteins (e.g. actin and myosin required for movement), enzymes (required for catalysing several biochemical reactions), hormones
(required for bodily functions), receptors (e.g. proteins involved in nerve cell transmission) or transcription factors (Fig. 1.2). Generalized functions of dietary proteins
in human body are outlined below.

**Fig. 1.2** Major functions of proteins in human body


-----

1 Dietary Proteins: Functions, Health Benefits and Healthy Aging 13
###### ***1.4.1 Building Blocks***

Dietary proteins are fundamentally the source of amino acids and nitrogen that serve
as raw materials in the synthesis of body proteins required for formation/synthesis of
vital organs, muscles, bones, biological fluids, hormones, enzymes, neurotransmitters, nucleic acids, etc. (Henley et al. 2010; Wu 2013; Wu et al. 2017). A large portion
of proteins in animal body is involved in providing structural stability and mobility.
These proteins include collagen, actin and myosin that are essential in muscle structure and functioning (e.g. contraction and relaxation). Collagen proteins also function
to make a large portion of the organic structural matrix of bones. Dietary proteins
provide amino acids for the synthesis of such structural and contractile proteins. As
the human body is incapable of maintaining reserves of proteins, a constant supply of
dietary protein is essential for maintaining tissue repairing/growth and other physiological functions. Insufficient intake of proteins especially during development and
growth years can affect all tissues/organs of the body (Boye et al. 2012), while adverse
protein deficiency in adults results in breakdown of lean tissues and muscle mass
for providing amino acids and other nitrogenous precursors required for synthesis of
compounds critical for survival e.g. insulin and haemoglobin (Hoffer 1994). ***1.4.2 Biological Catalysts***

Proteins are involved in biochemical reactions as biological catalysts or enzymes
that accelerate the rate of reactions. All processes in nature require enzymes to occur
at required rates, while metabolic pathways in cells are said to be determined by
the type and amount of enzymes present (van Oort 2010). Enzymes are essential
in signal transduction, cell regulation, mobility/movement, digestion, and so one
(Hunter 1995; Berg et al. 2001). Their functioning in specific order is essential for
creating metabolic pathways, whereas their absence will cause metabolism to neither
progress nor be fast enough to serve the requirements of cells. For example, glucose
can react directly with ATP to get phosphorylated during glycolysis. However, in the
absence of enzymes, phosphorylation is insignificant, while the presence of enzyme
hexokinase speeds up the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate which
gets finally converted to pyruvate in a series of reactions involving activities of a
number of enzymes. ***1.4.3 Immune Function***

Proteins are key component in immune system. Amino acids play important roles in
immune responses by regulating 1) the activation of T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes,
natural killer cells and macrophages, 2) cellular redox state, gene expression


-----

14 K. Shevkani and S. Chourasia

and lymphocyte proliferation and 3) the production of antibodies, cytokines and
other cytotoxic substances (Li et al. 2007). Glutamine serves as a major energy
substrate for immunocytes (Wu 2013). During conditions of infection, amino acid
requirement of immune cells increases rapidly to meet synthesis of immunological
proteins (Le Floch et al. 2004). The deficiency of dietary proteins can make the
body severely prone to infections and diseases owing to the unavailability/lesser
availability of materials required by immune system, while dietary supplementation of specific amino acids (e.g. arginine, glutamine and cysteine) to individuals
with malnutrition/infections could contribute to enhanced immunity and reduced
morbidity/mortality (Li et al. 2007).
###### ***1.4.4 Transporting Nutrients***

Proteins in body also function as carriers for transporting nutrients between different
organs/tissues/cells (Byrd-Bredbenner et al. 2009). Haemoglobin and myoglobin
(involved in transportation of oxygen from lungs to organs/tissues/cells) are the
most common examples of transport proteins. Lipoproteins function to transport lipid
molecules from the small intestine to various locations. Apart from these, important
transfer proteins involved in nutrient metabolism in human body include ferritin (a
protein that can store Fe and release the same in a controlled manner), transferrin
(plasma protein responsible for transporting Fe in body), retinol-binding protein (a
protein for carrying Vit-A) and ceruloplasmin (a carrier protein for copper). ***1.4.5 Maintenance of Fluid Balance and Regulation of pH***

Proteins are involved in maintenance of fluid balance in the body (Byrd-Bredbenner
et al. 2009). Blood pressure in arteries makes blood to enter minute blood vessels
(also called as capillary beds), from where blood fluids pass to extracellular spaces
for providing nutrients to cells. As proteins in the blood (e.g. albumins) are too large
to enter extracellular spaces, they stay there and contribute to the maintenance of fluid
balance by attracting proper amount of fluid back from cellular spaces to the blood
stream. Accumulation of excessive amount of fluids in tissues in the presence of lesser
amounts of proteins in bloodstream caused by inadequate intake of dietary proteins
results in swelling of tissues, a clinical condition called as *oedema* . Proteins in the
membrane also contribute to the regulation of acid-base balance and maintenance of
pH in human body by acting as buffers for the body (Byrd-Bredbenner et al. 2009).

###### ***1.4.6 Providing Glucose During Fasting or Starvation***

Humanbodyneedstomaintainacertainminimumlevelofglucoseinthebloodstream
to keep organs/tissues/cells functioning. During the period of fasting or starvation,
body uses proteins for synthesizing glucose through gluconeogenesis. Body proteins
provide most of the glucose (about 90%) needed during the first few days of fasting
for functioning of body (Byrd-Bredbenner et al. 2009). ***1.4.7 Satiation***

Dietary proteins also contribute to the satiety and suppression of apatite. They provide
greater satiety than carbohydrates and fats (Weigle et al. 2005). Protein induced
satiety is attributed to the combined effects of elevated plasma amino acid and anorexigenichormonelevels,prolongedsuppressionofhungerhormone(ghrelin),increased
diet-induced thermogenesis (increased dissipation of energy at rest) and ketogenic
state (Drummen et al. 2018). Satiation effect of dietary proteins is discussed in detail
in the Sect. 1.5.2 of the chapter. ***1.4.8 Providing Energy***

Similar as carbohydrates and lipids, proteins can provide energy to humans. The liver
is able to break amino acids to the carbon skeleton, which can then be used for energy.
*In vivo* oxidation of proteins to water and carbon dioxide releases 4.1 kcal/g, which is
equal to starch (4.1 kcal/g) but lesser than that released from lipids (9.4 kcal/g) (Wu
2016). However, as these nutrients are not digested completely and because protein
oxidationinthebodyisincomplete,theenergyvaluesof4,4and9kcal/g,respectively
are taken for dietary proteins, available carbohydrates (e.g. starches, sugars, etc.)
and fats/oils (Wu 2016). Usually 10–20% of energy is derived from dietary proteins.
However, amino acids are not preferred as a source of energy by body. They exhibit
lower energetic efficiency than fatty acids and glucose (Wu 2013). Also, they burden
kidneys and liver with excessive amount of processing and metabolism for being
utilized as a source of energy (Byrd-Bredbenner et al. 2009). **1.5 Health Benefits and Healthy Aging**

In addition of performing essential functions in metabolic and physiological
processes, dietary proteins also contribute to disease prevention and healthy aging.
High protein intake has been associated with reduced overall mortality and morbidity


-----

16 K. Shevkani and S. Chourasia

in elderly people owing to the positive effect of protein consumption towards reduced
risk of age/lifestyle-related diseases including sarcopenia, cardiovascular diseases,
osteoporosis, obesity and diabetes (Gaffney-Stomberg et al. 2009; Vikøren et al.
2013; Levine et al. 2014; Wu 2016). This section discusses health-benefitting effects
of dietary proteins in elderly people.
###### ***1.5.1 Maintenance of Muscle Mass***

Progressive muscle loss and associated reduction in lean body mass with aging is
termed as sarcopenia. It is considered as an insidious process characterized by 3–8%
reduction in lean muscle mass per decade after the age of 30 years (Paddon-Jones
and Rasmussen 2009). Sarcopenia is one of the major causes of functional impairment/disability and mortality in elderly people (Houston et al. 2008). The condition is quite prevalent in elderly people affecting about 30% of population of over
60 years of age and more than half of those above 80 years (Baumgartner et al.
1998). Sarcopenia can develop because of a number of reasons including sedentary lifestyle, inadequate protein intake, impaired turnover rate of proteins, neurodegeneration, reduced anabolic hormone production, dysregulation of cytokines and
inflammation (Gaffney-Stomberg et al. 2009; Paddon-jones and Rasmussen 2009;
Fukagawa 2013). However, low protein intake is considered as a key factor in the
age-related muscle loss as amino acids are a prerequisite for the synthesis of muscle
proteins while many elderly people do not take dietary proteins in adequate amounts
owing to several reasons including 1) high cost, 2) tooth decay and difficulties in
chewing, 3) perceived intolerance to certain foods and 4) avoidance of animal foods
to minimize cholesterol and lipids intake (Chernoff 2004; Houston et al. 2008). Moreover, reduction in anabolic signals for muscle protein synthesis with ageing further
accelerates muscle loss and development of sarcopenia. Guillet et al. (2004) reported
lower increase in muscle protein synthesis (0.023% per hour) with infusion of amino
acids and insulin in older people than adult subjects (0.041% per hour).
Physical activity and intake of dietary proteins are main anabolic stimuli for
synthesis of muscle proteins. Regular exercise with protein supplementation not only
can reduce the progression of sarcopenia but also treat the same by increasing musclestrength, size and mass (Campbell 2007; Strasser et al. 2018). However, as older
adults require to take greater amount of proteins for achieving maximum stimulation
of muscle protein synthesis than younger ones (Moore et al. 2015), they may be
advised to take proteins in excess of the recommended dietary allowance (0.8–1.0 g
proteins/kg body weight/day) for prevention of sarcopenia through maintenance of
positive nitrogen balance and preservation of muscle mass (Campbell 2007; GaffneyStomberg et al. 2009; Kerstetter et al. 2015; Baum and Wolfe 2015; Lonnie et al.
2018). Genaro et al. (2015) while evaluating differences in protein intake in women
with or without sarcopenia reported higher muscle mass for group consuming >1.2 g
proteins/kg body weight/day. Rizzoli (2015) and Gaffney-Stomberg et al. (2009) also
recommended protein intake of 1.0–1.2 g/kg body weight/day with repartition for


-----

preventing sarcopenia and maintaining nitrogen balance without having any harmful
health effects. However, in addition to protein quantity, protein quality (amino acid
composition and bioavailability) also is relevant in muscle protein synthesis and
prevention of sarcopenia. Indispensable amino acids, particularly branched-chain
amino acids, appear to be highly effective in stimulating muscle protein synthesis
and enhancing muscle strength. The supplementation of branched-chain amino acids
together with L-glutamine reversed muscle loss in total gastrectomized rats (Haba
et al. 2019). Also, leucine supplementation improved condition of patients with
muscle wasting diseases (Wandrag et al. 2015). In this regard, proteins from animal
sources may be considered effective in stimulating muscle protein synthesis owing to
highcontentofessentialaminoacidsincludingleucine(BaumandWolfe 2015;Shang
et al. 2018). However, some recent studies highlight that proteins from plants (e.g.
soybean) alone or in combination with animal proteins can be equally beneficial in
minimizing muscle wasting and preventing sarcopenia. For example, Jarzaguet et al.
(2018) reported increased anabolic response of skeletal muscles in aged rats with
meals comprising of >25% soy/whey proteins. In another clinical study on bedridden
patients, soybean proteins in diet were found to be superior to milk proteins (casein)
in enhancing muscle strength, though casein supplementation resulted in greater
enlargement of muscle volume (Hashimoto et al. 2015). However, more studies are
required for evaluating the effectiveness of proteins from different plant sources in
the prevention of sarcopenia.
###### ***1.5.2 Weight Management***

Obesity is characterized by excessive deposition of fat in body. A person is said
to be obese when exhibits body mass index (a measure of the healthy weight of an
adult for her/his height, which is calculated by dividing body mass to squared height;
BMI) value of ≥30 kg/m [2] . Obesity prevails in all age groups and affects a significant
portion of the population of the world. In 2016, about 13% of adults (11% men and
15% women of >18 years of age), while 6% of girls and 8% of boys of 5–19 years of
age were obese (WHO 2020a). Moreover, its prevalence is increasing in many parts
of the world including middle and low-income countries. In Africa, the number of
overweight children has increased by approximately 24% since 2000, while almost
50% of children less than 5 years of age who were overweight or obese in 2019 lived
in Asia (WHO 2020a).
Medically, obesity is classified as a complex condition that not only impairs physical ability but also can detrimentally affect longevity, health-span and quality of
life by increasing the risk of many diseases including diabetes, cardiac diseases
(includingcongestiveheartfailure,hypertension,atherosclerosis,etc.),non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease, some types of cancers, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease,
musculoskeletal disorders, chronic limb pains, osteoarthritis, Alzheimer’s disease,
dementia, impaired respiratory function, obstructive sleep apnoea and increased
susceptibility to infections (Elia 2001; Coggon et al. 2001; Frasca and McElhaney


-----

18 K. Shevkani and S. Chourasia

2019). In the elderly, obesity can lead to early onset of chronic diseases, respiratory
tract infections, functional impairment and premature mortality (Lorenzo et al. 2006;
Amarya et al. 2014; Frasca and McElhaney 2019). Causes of obesity include hereditary/genetics, hormonal imbalances, metabolic factors and life-style related conditions, though it is mostly because of life-style related factors that include chronic
positive energy balance (regular intake of calories in excess of expenditure) and lack
of physical activity (Paddon-Jones et al. 2008). The treatment of obesity requires a
negative energy balance which may be achieved by indulging in physical activities
and/or sticking to energy restricted diets. Further, increased satiety and suppressed
apatite can also contribute to weight loss and obesity prevention. However, the weight
loss strategies for overweight/obese elderly people are required to be considered carefully in order to achieve weight loss with minimum loss of lean muscles as a specific
condition, termed as sarcopenic obesity (a medical condition characterized by an
excessive fat deposition in combination with a detrimental loss of lean body mass),
is more common in elderly people (Mathus-Vliegen 2012).
Protein intake has been associated with weight management/obesity prevention.
Protein intake at levels of requirement through energy restricted diets contributes
to weight loss, while increased intakes are effective in maintaining fat-free mass
(Drummen et al. 2018). Soenen et al. (2013) reported reduction in body and fatmass in overweight and obese men and women of 18–80 years of age with BMI
>25 kg/m [2] given dietary proteins at and above the levels of requirements (0.8 g/kg
body weight/day and 1.2 g/kg body weight/day, respectively). In comparison, the
dietary protein intake below requirement levels could result in lesser weight loss
and higher risk of weight regain (Acheson 2013). Weigle et al. (2005) reported
positive outcomes of increased protein and reduced fat intake (from 15 to 30%
and from 35 to 20% of energy, respectively) at constant carbohydrate intake on
weight loss. Protein induced weight loss can be attributed to satiation and increased
energy expenditure. Protein-rich diets were more satiating than that high in fats and
carbohydrates. Marmonier et al. (2000) while investigating the effect of protein,
fat or carbohydrates-rich snack (each providing 250 kcal) after *ad libitum* lunch
on apatite (requests for next meal) observed the longest delay in requests for next
meal (60 min) for protein-rich snack. High-carbohydrate and high-fat snacks, in
comparison, delayed dinner requests by 35 and 25 min, respectively (Marmonier
et al. 2000). The contribution of dietary proteins to satiety and weight loss has been
attributed to their effect on hormones involved in apatite regulation, e.g. ghrelin,
leptin, insulin, amylin, adiponectin, glucagon-like peptides, cholecystokinin, etc.
(Lonnie et al. 2018), as well as to specific amino acids, e.g. tryptophan, tyrosine
and/or histidine, which are used for synthesis of neurotransmitters (e.g. serotonin,
dopamine, norepinephrine and histamine) involved in regulation of food intake and
apatite (Keller 2011). Moreover, the satiation effect of a few food proteins (e.g.
casein proteins of milk) also can be associated with acid-induced coagulation in
stomach, which may inhibit gastric digestion by slowing diffusion of pepsin into
coagulated proteins (Thévenot et al. 2017). This affects release of partially digested
proteins/peptides into small intestine and contributes to appetite control by creating
a prolonged feeling of fullness (Loveday 2019).

In addition, protein-induced weight loss also is attributed to high energy expenditure as protein-rich foods require greater amount of energy for digestion, absorption
and metabolism (thermic effect of food; TEF) in comparison to carbohydrates and
fats. The TEF value of protein-rich foods range from 20 to 30%, whereas carbohydrates and lipids-rich foods show TEF values of 5–10% and 0–3%, respectively
(Byrd-Bredbenner et al. 2009). Increased energy expenditure for protein-rich foods
is attributed to metabolic inefficiency of protein oxidation in comparison to glucose
(more energy is required for producing ATP from amino acids than from glucose),
gluconeogenesis and urea synthesis (Westerterp-Plantenga et al. 2009; Keller 2011).
Furthermore, the energy expenditure of high protein intake has also been attributed
to its effect on thyroid hormones, androgens, catecholamines and growth hormone
(Mikkelsen et al. 2000).
Plant proteins also demonstrate effects similar to that of animal proteins in the
context of the ability to increase satiety and delay hunger. Neacsu et al. (2014)
while investigating appetite responses to high-protein weight-loss diets in obese
men of 34–71 years of age reported statistically similar hunger, desire-to-eat and
weight loss for meat and soybean-based diets. Veldhorst et al. (2009) compared
the effect of casein, soybean and whey-protein breakfasts on appetite regulating
hormones (glucagon-like peptide-1 and insulin). Although the strongest effect was
shown by whey, mediating effects on these hormones were also observed for soybean
proteins and casein (Veldhorst et al. 2009). In another report, Scully et al. (2017) also
reported no significant differences in appetite and food intake for participants of 23–
63 years of age with BMI of 19.3–38.9 kg/m [2] given buckwheat and fava bean based
diets. In addition, legumes/pulses also have an edge over animal products for weight
loss strategies in elderly people because of high protein to calorie ratio which is
attributable to low lipids content (for most legumes/pulses with exception of dried
seeds/kernels of soybean, lupine and groundnut, though lipids in these legumes are
rich in health benefitting unsaturated fatty acids) and high content of unavailable
complex carbohydrates including oligosaccharides, resistant starch and soluble and
insoluble dietary fibres.
###### ***1.5.3 Cardiac Health***

Cardiac diseases are responsible for approximately 18 million deaths annually.

diseases. Although the development of cardiac diseases is associated with many
aspects of lifestyle, besides heredity, the most significant risk factors are related to
food habits (Cam and de Mejia 2012). Dietary proteins are considered an important source of bioactive peptides that can contribute to lower the risk of cardiac
diseases owing to anti-hypercholesterolemic, anti-hypertensive, anti-thrombotic and
anti-inflammatory activities (Nasri 2017; Tapal et al. 2019). However, proteins from


-----

plant sources, in general, have an edge over animal proteins in the context of their
effect on cardiac health. Virtanen et al. (2019) reported high mortality risk associated with ischaemic heart diseases amongst Finnish males of 42–60 years of age
consuming greater amounts of animal proteins than plant proteins. Li et al. (2017)
based on a meta-analysis highlighted reduction in blood LDL-C, non-HDL-C and
apolipoprotein-B levels after substitution of animal proteins with plant proteins.
Similarly, Bernstein et al. (2010) and Bernstein et al. (2012) while investigating the
effect of protein sources on cardiac diseases also highlighted reduction in the risk of
strokes and other coronary heart diseases with replacement of red meat as protein
source with poultry, nuts, fish and low-fat milk products.
Amongst different plant proteins, legume proteins (particularly soybean) have
been investigated extensively for their effects on cardiac health. Intake of soybean
proteins was found to upregulate LDL receptors in the liver (Baum et al. 1998)
and reduce levels of total cholesterol, LDL-C and triacylglycerol (Torres et al. 2006;
Borodin et al. 2009). Sacks et al. (2006) based on 22 randomized trials recommended
a minimum daily intake of 50 g of soybean proteins for achieving reduction in serum
lipids levels. The lipid lowering effects of soybean proteins have been attributed
to the presence of isoflavones (Anthony et al. 1996) and release of small peptides
(<15 amino acids) after digestion/hydrolysis (Sirtori et al. 2007). In addition, the
beneficial effect of soybean proteins on cardiac health may also be due to the lower
ratio of leucine to arginine than animal proteins as high concentration of arginine in
plasma was associated with hypocholesterolemic effect, whereas leucine acted as a
cholesterol precursor having a strong insulinotropic effect (Chalvon-Demersay et al.
2017). Proteins from other legumes, e.g., lupine, chickpeas, cowpea and peas, also
exert beneficial effects on cardiac health. In studies by Bettzieche et al. (2009) and
Fontanari et al. (2012), lupine proteins were shown to increase plasma HDL-C level
while reducing levels of triacylglycerol and LDL-C in hypercholesterolemic rats and
hamsters. Similarly, the study by Frota et al. (2015) also reported 2.7% increase in
HDL-C while 12% reduction in total cholesterol, 18.9% in LDL-C and 16% nonHDL-C in hypercholesterolemic subjects (30–70 years of age) with consumption of
25 g cowpea protein isolate per day. In relatively recent works, chickpea peptides
lowered lipids level and reversed liver damage in hyperlipidaemic mice (Xue et al.
2018), while hydrolysed pea proteins inhibited lipid accumulation in adipose tissue
cells (3T3-L1 cells) in a concentration dependent manner (Flores-Medellín et al.
2021).
Milk proteins (e.g. whey proteins) also exert beneficial effects on cardiac health
owing to their ability to improve vascular functions and reduce LDL-C and total
cholesterol. Ballard et al. (2013) reported improvements in vascular function in overweight individuals after ingestion of whey peptides, while Pal et al. (2010) showed
reduction in triacylglycerol, total cholesterol and LDL-C levels by 22, 11 and 7%,
respectively in overweight to obese subjects of 18–65 years of age and 25–40 kg/m [2]

BMI with ingestion of whey protein isolate (27 g twice a day) for 12 weeks. The
beneficial effects of milk proteins have been attributed to increased lipolysis, reduced
lipid accretion, reduced absorption of dietary cholesterol/fatty acids and increased
insulin resistance (Chen and Reimer 2009; Lillefosse et al. 2014; Fekete et al. 2016).

1 Dietary Proteins: Functions, Health Benefits and Healthy Aging 21

Proteins from fish also have hypocholesterolemic and hypolipidimic effects in
animal models (Shukla et al. 2006; Kawabata et al. 2015; Drotningsvik et al. 2016).
The effect of fish protein intake on blood lipid profile was investigated by Shukla et al.
(2006). Rats fed on fish proteins showed lower levels of triacylglycerol and cholesterolwhilehigherlevelsofliverLDL-receptorsandsterolregulatory-bindingproteins
than casein fed rats. However, unlike legume proteins, fish proteins also decreased
levels of HDL-C (Shukla et al. 2006). Reduced serum and liver cholesterol levels
have also been reported for fish protein-fed rats by Hosomi et al. (2011) and Hosomi
et al. (2013). The hypolipidimic effects of fish proteins were attributed to the inhibition of the absorption of bile acid in the small intestine and enhanced excretion of
cholesterol in faeces as a result of increased expression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase
and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-2 enzymes involved in lipid metabolism (Hosomi
et al. 2011; Hosomi et al. 2013).
###### ***1.5.4 Bone Health***

Proteins make up about half of the bone volume and about one-third of the bone
weight (Heaney 2007) as they (mainly collagen and various other non-collagen
proteins) are primarily responsible for the organic structural matrix of bones. The loss
of bone mass/density with aging results in enhanced bone fragility and increased risks
of fractures which not only causes people to become bedridden but also can cause life
threatening complications in elderly individuals. Besides Ca, P and Vit-D, dietary
proteins and physical activities are considered critical in achieving optimal bone mass
and preventing bone loss in elderly people (Rizzoli 2014; Gaffney-Stomberg et al.
2014; Morris-Naumann and Wark 2015). However, high dietary protein intake has
been shown to have positive as well as negative effects on bone health. For example,
high protein intake was associated with demineralisation of bones and development
of osteoporosis because of stimulation of urinary Ca excretion and acidification of
blood (Heaney and Layman 2008; Wu 2016). Zwart et al. (2005) reported negative
Ca balance and increased urinary excretion of this mineral in male subjects on diet
high in essential amino acids. They attributed this response to the increased intake
of sulphur containing amino acids that increase Ca excretion by increasing endogenous sulphuric acid production. On the other hand, many studies regarded dietary
proteins as an essential nutrient in bone health owing to their involvement in 1)
providing organic structural matrix, 2) optimising the level of growth factors (e.g.
insulin-like growth factors which can increase bone mass by increasing osteoblasts
activity), 3) increasing absorption of calcium in intestine, 4) stimulation of bonemineralisation and 5) inhibition of bone resorption and inflammatory cytokines that
could activate bone degradation (Fernandes et al. 2003; Heaney and Layman 2008;
Millward et al. 2008; Gaffney-Stomberg et al. 2009; Hardy and Cooper 2009; Zhang
et al. 2011; Gaffney-Stomberg et al. 2011; Kerstetter et al. 2015; Wolfe 2015; Shang
et al. 2018). In addition, high protein diets have also been associated with higher Ca

intake, which can, therefore, compensate for any moderate increase in urinary excretion of the mineral (Wu 2016). Shams-White et al. (2017) based on a meta-analysis
evaluation concluded no adverse effect of high protein intake on bone health and
highlighted that a higher protein intake may reduce bone mineral density loss in
older adults in comparison to a lower protein intake. Similarly, Groenendijk et al.
(2019) while performing a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effect of
high/low protein intake on bone health in elderly people also highlighted a positive association of higher protein intakes with bone (femoral neck and hip) mineral
density and reduced hip bone fracture risks. However, the effect of dietary protein
intake on bone health relates with the intake of other nutrients. Dawson-Hughes
et al. (2002) showed crucial roles of Ca and Vit-D on the impact of dietary protein
on bone health as greater protein intake was associated with increased bone mineral
density in older adults during a 3-year supplementation period of these nutrients,
though such improvement required sufficient dietary Ca and Vit-D intake as relationships between protein intake and bone density were not observed for placebo
group (Dawson-Hughes and Harris 2002).
###### ***1.5.5 Type-2 Diabetes***

Diabetes is a chronic disease of metabolism characterized by high blood glucose
levels occurring due to the lack of insulin production or ineffective use of insulin by
cells (Roglic 2016). The disease affects about 8.5% population of the world and is
considered as a major cause of kidney diseases, blindness, heart diseases and limb
amputation (WHO 2020b). Obesity is one of the most important risk factors in type-2
diabetes. Moreover, reduced muscle mass as a result of sarcopenia/sarcopenic obesity
may also result in reduced insulin sensitivity and decreased glucose uptake which
in turn can increase the risk for hyperglycemia and insulin-resistance syndrome in
elderly people with diabetes (Solerte et al. 2008). Healthy lifestyle (regular physical
activity and consumption of healthy diets for maintenance of normal body weight)
can, therefore, be useful in delaying or managing this chronic disease. However, the
association of dietary protein intake with type-2 diabetes varies with proteins sources.
Pal et al. (2010) reported favourable effects of whey protein intake towards reduced
riskofdiabetesinobesemenandwomenofBMI25–40kg/m [2] and18–65yearsinage,
while Sluijs et al. (2010) based on a prospective investigation highlighted increased
risk of type-2 diabetes with increased intake of total and animal proteins. Based on a
systematic review and meta-analysis study, Tian et al. (2017) also reported varying
effect of protein source on the risk of diabetes. Red and processed meats increased
risk of diabetes, soybean and milk had protective effect, while fish and egg intake
had no association with decreased risk of diabetes (Tian et al. 2017). In comparison,
Vikøren et al. (2013) in a randomised study on fish protein (3–6 g/day for 8 weeks)
effect on glucose metabolism in adults of 20–70 years of age with BMI ≥27 kg/m [2]

reported favourable effects of the protein supplementation on glucose metabolism
(lower fasting and postprandial glucose levels in comparison to placebo).

###### **1.6 Protein Quality and Its Evaluation**

Protein quality is an index of how well proteins meet requirements of amino acids and
physiological needs of organisms (Shivakumar et al. 2018). Protein quality depends
on amino acid composition and digestibility. The presence of all nine indispensable amino acids in adequate amounts reflects completeness of proteins, while high
digestibility indicates the bioavailability of those amino acids. Therefore, highly
digestible proteins that provide indispensable amino acids in amounts equal to or
greater than that required for growth and maintenance are said to be of high quality.
As elderly people generally consume foods (including proteins) in lesser amounts
than younger adults, protein quality becomes critical in meeting enhanced requirements of indispensable and functional amino acids. Positive associations between
the consumption of foods with high protein quality and healthy aging have been
reported (Mathus-Vliegen 2012; Paddon-Jones et al. 2015; Hidayat et al. 2018). ***1.6.1 Evaluation of Protein Quality***

Different methods, ranging from chemical and biochemical (enzymatic) to microbiological and biological in nature, have been developed and employed for evaluation of
protein quality (Damodaran 2017). Chemical methods, e.g. *amino acid score* (AAS)
also referred to as *chemical score* measure protein quality based on the amount of
most limiting indispensable amino acid in test protein and the content of the same in
a reference protein (usually egg white). It is calculated as:

m g of limitin g amino acid in 1 g of test p rotein
Amino acid score or chemical score =
mg of the same amino acid per g in reference protein

Enzymatic methods use proteolytic enzymes (pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin,
peptidases and/or proteases) under specific conditions of the test to determine in vitro
digestibility of proteins (Bodwell et al. 1980; Calsamiglia and Stern 1995). Microbiological methods, in comparison, measure quality of proteins by determining their
ability to support growth of microorganisms, including bacteria (e.g. *Streptococcus*
*zymogenes*, *S. faecalis*, *Leuconostoc mesenteroides* and *Clostridium perfringens* ) and
protozoa (e.g. *Tetrahymena pyriformis* ) exhibiting amino acid requirements similar
to humans (Ford 1981).
Chemical, enzymatic and microbiological methods have some advantages. Chemical methods are simple and less time consuming and involve comparison of amino
acid composition of test and reference proteins. Enzymatic methods are specifically useful in comparing different proteins for digestibility, while microbiological
assays can provide useful information on protein quality depending on the amino acid
requirements of organisms. However, these methods are subjected to several drawbacks, e.g., these assays do not take into account the effect of toxins, antinutritional
constituents, food additives and/or ingredients (e.g. common salt, nitrates, spices,


-----

etc.) affecting protein quality. Moreover, enzymatic and chemical assays provide
information only about in vitro digestibility/bioavailability and amino acid composition, respectively, while microbiological assays are useful for foods with known
composition (Satterlee et al. 1979; Pellett and Young 1980).
Biological methods, in comparison, measure protein quality based on nitrogen
retention and the ability of proteins to support growth (weight gain) in test animals
(Damodaran 2017). The protocols involve feeding test animals (usually rats) with
a test diet containing proteins in limited amounts (10% on dry basis) for a specific
period of time (9 days). Protein-free diet is given to the control group. The test diet is
formulated to provide adequate amount of energy so that proteins can be utilized in
the animal body to the maximum possible extent. Animal weight is noted daily and
faeces and urine are collected for nitrogen/protein content determination (FAO/WHO
1991). The data obtained is used in different ways to express protein quality as *protein*
*efficiency ratio*, *net protein ratio*, *true digestibility*, *biological value* and *net protein*
*utilisation* (Damodaran 2017).
*Protein efficiency ratio* is the simplest and most commonly used expression which
is defined as weight gained per gram of test protein consumed. It is expressed as:

Protein efficiency ratio = [Wei] [g] [ht ] [g] [ain in test animal on test diet]

Amount of protein ingested

The *protein efficiency ratio* is directly related to protein quality as the gain in
weight and growth achieved are dependent on the incorporation of dietary proteins
in body tissue. However, this expression is criticized for not taking into account
the dietary protein utilized for maintenance as only gain in weight is taken in the
calculation. *Net protein ratio*, in comparison, takes into account the weight lost in
protein-free group, hence provide information on the ability of protein to support
both maintenance and growth. This expression is calculated as:

Net protein ratio = *[(]* [Wei] [g] [ht ] [g] [ain] *[)]* [ −] *[(]* [Wei] [g] [ht loss for animals on ] [p] [rotein free diet] *[)]*

Amount of protein ingested

*True digestibility* and *biological value* determine protein quality by measuring
nitrogen uptake and nitrogen lost by test animals. These expressions involve faecal
nitrogen content determination to take in to account digestibility/nitrogen retention
as well as the metabolic/endogenous nitrogen. Therefore, these expressions are the
measure of the ability of dietary proteins to convert into body proteins. However, in
comparison to *true digestibility*, *biological value* also involves analysis of urine for
nitrogen content. *True digestibility* and *biological value* are calculated as:

True digestibility *(* % *)* = [Protein in] [g] [ested][ −] *[(]* [FN][ −] [FKN] *[)]* × 100 *.*

Protein ingested

Biological value = [Protein in] [g] [ested][ −] *[(]* [FN][ −] [FKN] *[)]* [ −] *[(]* [UN][ −] [UKN] *[)]* × 100 *.*

Protein ingested − *(* FN − FKN *)*


-----

1 Dietary Proteins: Functions, Health Benefits and Healthy Aging 25

where, FN and UN are nitrogen in faeces and urine of test animal, respectively,
while FKN and UKN represent metabolic/endogenous nitrogen lost through faeces
and urine, respectively of test animals on protein-free diet.
Another useful expression of protein quality is *net protein utilisation* . This expression provides the information on percentage of diary proteins retained in animal body.
It is a product of *true digestibility* and *biological value* and is calculated as:

Net protein utilisation = [Protein in] [g] [ested][ −] *[(]* [FN][ −] [FKN] *[)]* [ −] *[(]* [UN][ −] [UKN] *[)]* × 100

Protein ingested

*Protein digestibility corrected amino acid score* (PDCAAS) and *digestible indis-*
*pensable amino acid score* (DIAAS) are relatively recent developments in protein
quality evaluation. PDCAAS is obtained as the product of the *true digestibility* and
AAS as:

PDCAAS = Amino acid score × True digestibility

The PDCAAS is one of the recommended methods of protein quality evaluation
in human nutrition. This method has been widely adapted for protein quality evaluation (Schaafsma 2000), though it has also been criticised for some shortcomings. For
example, 1) the expression does not provide information of individual indispensable
amino acids bioavailability, 2) there may be overestimation of protein quality, specifically, of products containing known antinutritional constituents and 3) the method
is considered inappropriate for regulatory uses as there is overestimation of quality
for poorly digestible proteins supplemented with limiting amino acids (FAO 2013;
Rutherfurd et al. 2015; Mathai et al. 2017). The DIAAS is an alternative to PDCAAS.
In calculation of this score, the digestibility values of each indispensable amino acid
is taken into calculation. The DIAAS is calculated as:

m g of dietar y di g estible indis p ensable amino acid in 1 g dietar y p rotein
DIAAS =
mg of the same dietary indispensable amino acid in 1 g of the reference protein [×][ 100]

FAO now recommends DIAAS method for protein quality evaluation instead
of PDCAAS (FAO 2013). Also, it is now considered necessary to determine the
digestibility of individual indispensable amino acids at the end of the small intestine
( *ileum* ) in order to avoid any change in amino acid composition made by microorganisms in the large intestine (FAO 2013; Mathai et al. 2017) as the large microbial load
and long transit time in the large intestine can either promote microbial synthesis of
amino acids or their utilization by the microorganisms (Sauer et al. 1975; Trottier
and Walker 2015). Moreover, growing pig is now recognised as more appropriate
animal model for protein quality analysis because of its resemblance with humans
for rate of protein synthesis, 2) physiology of stomach (glandular-type stomach lined
with cardiac, gastric and pyloric mucosa) and small intestine, 3) topography of portal
vein, mesenteric vessels and duodenum and 4) functionality of liver and pancreas
(Kararli 1995; Swindle and Smith 1998; Deglaire et al. 2009; FAO 2013).

###### **1.7 Animal vs Plant Proteins**

Proteins from different sources differ for protein quality. Animal products (milk, egg,
meat and fish) contribute about 35% of total proteins globally (Wu et al. 2014). They
are generally considered as a source of high quality proteins because of the presence
of all nine indispensable amino acids in amounts adequate or more than adequate for
supporting growth (with the exception of gelatin/partially hydrolysed collagen that
lacks tryptophan and contains threonine, isoleucine and methionine in low amounts)
and high digestibility. Proteins of animal origin are highly digestible (94–97%) and
show higher PDCAAS (1.0 against 0.91, 0.67, 0.57, and 0.45 for soybeans, peas, oats
and wheat, respectively) than plant foods (FAO/WHO/UNU 1985; van Vliet et al.
2015; Damodaran 2017). However, as proteins do not occur in foods in isolation, the
entire food matrix should to be taken into account in order to evaluate health benefits
of a particular diet (Millward et al. 2008). While milk and fish are sources of high
quality proteins, healthy lipids (e.g. omega-3 oils in fish or conjugated linoleic acids
in milk), bioavailable haem-Fe and Vit-B12, the consumption of red and processed
meats has beenassociatedwithincreasedriskof chronicdiseases (e.g. coronaryartery
diseases, dyslipidaemia and some cancers) and all-cause mortality (Song et al. 2004;
Vang et al. 2008; Bernstein et al. 2010; Chan et al. 2011; Allen et al. 2013; Mirzaei
et al. 2014; Song et al. 2016; Sacks et al. 2017). The diets high in animal proteins
also can increase the risk of type-2 diabetes (Sluijs et al. 2010; Tian et al. 2017). A
high consumption of animal proteins brought about 75% increase in overall mortality
and about four-fold increase in the risk of developing cancer in the individuals of
50–65 years in age (Levine et al. 2014).
Plant proteins (particularly those from staple foods viz. cereals and
legumes/pulses), in comparison, are deficient in one or more essential amino acids.
Histidine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan and valine are present in
adequate amounts in plant foods, though lysine, threonine, tryptophan and/or methionine occur as limiting amino acids (indispensable amino acids present in amounts
less than that recommended for ensuring optimal growth and maintenance) in plant
proteins. For example, lysine is the most limiting amino acid in all cereals followed
by tryptophan in maize and threonine in most other cereals (Serna-Saldivar 2010).
Legumes/pulses, in comparison, are rich in lysine but lack methionine and cysteine
(Shevkani et al. 2019a; Ge et al. 2021). Therefore, individuals on diets containing
either cereal or legume proteins face difficulties in maintaining health/growth, though
a mixed diet containing proteins from both sources in adequate amounts can provide
all amino acids for supporting maintenance and growth. In addition, plant-based
foods also contain dietary fibre and phytochemicals, e.g. polyphenols, enzyme
inhibitors, phytates/phytic acid, saponins, etc. (Shevkani and Singh 2015; Singh
et al. 2017; Shevkani et al. 2019b), which, nowadays, are regarded as bioactive
compounds owing to several beneficial effects on health, e.g., regulation of blood
glucose level, improvement in lipid profile and reduced risk of some cancers and
coronary artery diseases (Schlemmer et al. 2009; Singh et al. 2017). Moreover, plant
protein sources (e.g. pulses/legumes, nuts, pseudocereals, etc.) also can contribute to


-----

1 Dietary Proteins: Functions, Health Benefits and Healthy Aging 27

reduced risks of lifestyle associated chronic diseases (e.g. diabetes, dyslipidaemia,
hypertension and some cancers) owing to the presence of active constituents e.g.
lectins/hemagglutinins, enzyme inhibitors, peptides and amino acids with antioxidative effects (Duranti 2006; Mendonca et al. 2009; Carbonaro et al. 2015; De Souza
et al. 2017; Shevkani et al. 2019a; Singh et al. 2019; Tovar-Pérez et al. 2019). Song
et al. (2016) highlighted association of high plant protein intake and replacement of
animal protein sources with plant sources with reduced all-cause and cardiovascularmortality. Ginter (2008) also reported lower ischemic heart disease mortality in vegetarians. This association was attributed to high antioxidant status, lower prevalence
of obesity and low cholesterol and blood pressure levels. World Cancer Research
Fund (2018) also recommends to increase consumption of a plant-based diets (high
in whole grains, vegetables, fruits and legumes/pulses) while limiting the consumption of red meats (beef, veal, pork, lamb, mutton, horse, and goat) to 3 servings (each
of 350–500 g) per week and that of processed meats (i.e. meats processed by salting,
curing, fermentation, smoking, etc.) to very little amounts. Furthermore, a few relatively recent studies on the effect of plant-based diet on physical performance show
little or no differences in endurance capacity and performance (Lynch et al. 2016;
Craddock et al. 2016; Nebl et al. 2019). However, in spite of the nutritional and
nutraceutical advantages of plant proteins, a complete shift to vegan/vegetarian diets
may not be recommended for elderly people considering the risk of Vit-B12 deficiency, elevating homocysteine levels (Obersby et al. 2013; Lonnie et al. 2018) and
the association of protein quality with reduced morbidity or mortality. A mixed diet,
e.g. lacto-vegetarian diet, may be regarded adequate taking in account high indispensable amino acids to calorie ratio of dairy foods (particularly low and reduced-fat
milk and milk products) and considering dairy products as an excellent source of vitamins and minerals (e.g. Ca, P and Vit-D that are essential for optimal bone health),
bioactive proteins/peptides (e.g. lactoferrin), probiotics (specifically fermented milk
products) and high quality proteins. Song et al. (2016) while comparing major protein
sources associated dairy product intake with lower mortality than the consumption
of processed meats and eggs. New dietary guidelines (e.g. The Eatwell Guide) also
recommend to increase intake of plant foods (fruits, vegetables, pulses and whole
grain cereals) and include low fat dairy products/alternatives (e.g. low fat milk,
reduced-fat cheese, plain low-fat yoghurt, soy milk, etc.) in daily diet while reducing
the intake of red meats, processed meats and foods high in fat, sugar and salt-content
(Public Health England 2016).
###### **1.8 Conclusion**

Proteins are essential for survival and perform critical functions in the growth and
maintenance of human body. Increased intake of dietary proteins can contribute to
healthy aging and longevity by preventing/delaying chronic age-related diseases,

##### **Chapter 2**
#### **Carbohydrates as Nutritional** **Components for Health and Longevity**

**Gozde Okburan and Ceren Gezer**

**Abstract** Carbohydrates act as signaling molecules, energy sources, and structural
components. The importance of carbohydrates in human life has been reinforced
by understanding the tight and important relationship between a carbohydrate-rich
diet and chronic metabolic diseases. High quality and quantity of carbohydrate
intake increases 5’adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and
sirtuins while causing a reduction in rapamycin (mTOR) and insulin/IGF-1/GH
levels. An increase in AMPK and sirtuins is thus a decrease in mTOR, and improved
insulin/IGF-1/GH levels improve cellular processes related with aging such as mitochondrialbiogenesis,autophagy,cellularmetabolism,oxidativestress,genomemaintenance, and protein synthesis. Along with all these consequences, it is assumed that,
with the right type and amount of carbohydrates, human life is expected to be positively affected. Concerning the amount of carbohydrates and health consequences,
both high and low carbohydrate intake were associated with increased mortality;
thus, 50–60% of total energy intake is recommended. Also, carbohydrate type is
related with non-communicable chronic disease risk and mortality. Consumption of
added and free sugars, in particular, is related to obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular
diseases. Sufficient intake of fibre-rich sources such as non-starchy vegetables, whole
fruits, whole grains, and legumes is generally recommended to reduce the alarming
rate of chronic diseases and mortality. Therefore, 25–29 g/day dietary fibre and <10%
of daily energy from free sugars intake is recommended. In conclusion, both quality
and quantity of carbohydrates notably modifies health, aging, and longevity.

###### **2.1 Introduction**

Nutrition has critical long-term consequences for health. Dietary patterns and nutrition are among the vital factors affecting the development and progression of chronic
diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer. Since half of the
deaths in the world are caused by chronic diseases, prevention, and management
of these diseases are global priorities. At this point, it would be useful to underline
how important a role nutrition plays in human life (Mckay and Mathers 2011). All
organisms need to get nutrients from their environment in order to survive. These
nutrients are identified as organic chemicals such as carbohydrates, proteins, lipids,
vitamins, and inorganic substances such as minerals and water. These nutrients are
essential for biological functions including metabolism, growth, and repair. All of
the various activities and processes that take place in the body require energy. Carbohydrates, proteins, and fats are known as macronutrients, which provide energy and
are measured in the form of calories (Shukla et al. 2017). Calorie restriction, that
is, restriction of dietary energy intake without causing malnutrition, has been shown
to improve the maintenance of the biological system and enhance lifespan (Kenyon
2010). The effects of nutrition and caloric restriction on human life expectancy has
been recognized since the days of Hippocrates, who noted that excessive eating
shortens lifespan (Hyung 2010). In more recent history, data presented by McCay
et al. (1935) found, for the first time, that the restriction of calories without malnutrition prolonged mean and maximal lifespan in rats compared with ad libitum feeding.
Since then, reduced food intake, known as calorie restriction, has become an established pattern in the area of aging studies. It is considered a robust and reproducible
intervention regarding aging, delayed aging, and increased lifespan. A study indicating the relationship between energy restriction and prolongation of life showed
that, compared to a study group on an ad-libitum diet (control group), members of a
study group with a dietary energy restriction of approximately 30–50% of the typically consumed amount and supplementation of micronutrients, increased their life
expectancy (Speakman and Mitchell 2011). Many studies have shown that reduced
calorie intake by alteration of nutrient content, such as fat, carbohydrates, or amino
acids, can have different impacts on longevity in animal models and in human studies
(Guasch-Ferré et al. 2015; Martinez-Gonzalez and Martin-Calvo 2016; Kirkpatrick
et al. 2019). Regarding the effect of energy density and macronutrient composition
on aging and lifespan, The Geometric Framework for Nutrition concluded that, while
keeping energy intake stable, reducing the ratio of protein to carbohydrates (without
causing malnutrition) extends life (Lee et al. 2008; Solon-Biet et al. 2015a, b; Couteur
et al. 2016a, b). Carbohydrates are organic compounds that contain carbon, hydrogen,
andoxygenina1:2:1ratio.Carbohydratesactassignalingmolecules,energysources,
and structural components. The importance of carbohydrates in human life has been
reinforced by understanding the closely linked and important relationship between
a carbohydrate-rich diet and chronic metabolic diseases. It has been suggested that
some types of carbohydrates directly affect lifespan through signaling pathways

in vitro and in vivo in various organisms (Lee et al. 2015). Therefore, the potential
influence of carbohydrates on human health, aging, and longevity will be discussed.
###### **2.2 Potential Mechanisms and Roles for Dietary** **Carbohydrates in Human Aging**

Carbohydrates are the most abundant organic molecules in nature and are also key
molecules for cellular processes such as energy production. Several forms of carbohydrates are converted to glucose in order to be used as the primary source of energy
in cells (Buyken et al. 2018). They also act as a stored form of energy in the body and
serve as cell membrane components that mediate some forms of intercellular communication. Carbohydrates are classified according to the degree of polymerization, or
number of saccharide units, in the carbohydrate molecule. Table 2.1 provides the
various saccharide categories along with examples of commonly consumed carbohydrates. Glucose and fructose are the main monosaccharides are present in fruits
and vegetables, while fructose is also used in processed foods. Sucrose is generally
the most abundant disaccharide in Westernized diets, with foods providing naturally

**Table 2.1** Classification of
carbohydrates (Burke 2000)

|Type|Examples|
|---|---|
|Monosaccharide (1 unit)|Glucose Fructose Galactose|
|Disaccharides (2 units)|Sucrose Lactose Maltose|
|Oligosaccharides (3–20 units)|Raffinose (3 units) Stachyose (4 units) Verbascose (5 units) Fructo-oligosaccharides Commercially derived glucose polymers/maltodextrins (5–15 units)|
|Polysaccharides (20–1000 units) Starch|Amylose Amylopectin|
|Non-starch polysaccharides|Cellulose Hemicellulose Pectins -glucans β Fructans Gums Mucilages Algal polysaccharides|

occurring and/or added sources of this sugar, while lactose is provided primarily by
dairy foods. Oligosaccharides form only a small amount of dietary carbohydrates
intake and are found in legumes, while fructo-oligosaccharides are found in other
vegetables. Starch provides plant storage for carbohydrates, and appears primarily
in grains, legumes, and some vegetables and fruit. The non-starch polysaccharides
(NSPs) include structural cell wall components (hemicellulose and cellulose, along
with pectins) as well as storage polysaccharides, gums, and mucilages. These NSPs
share the characteristic of being largely undigested in the small intestine, and together
with lignin comprise dietary fibre (Burke 2000).
Studies have shown that glucose, which is a monosaccharide, affects lifespan in
several model organisms (Lee et al. 2015). Generally, the influence of carbohydrates
on lifespan may show either positive or negative effects, depending on the quality
and quantity of the dietary carbohydrates (Ludwig et al. 2018). While some studies
have shown that glucose-enriched diets decrease lifespan, other research has found
that various other carbohydrates and carbohydrate metabolites, including trehalose,
pyruvate, malate, fumarate, and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) increase longevity
(Lee et al. 2015, 2017). Various mechanisms have been shown to identify the nutrientsensing cellular pathways that link diet and aging. Low protein, high carbohydrate
(LPHC) diets have been found to retard aging by mechanisms and pathways similar
to calorie restricted diets (Couteur et al. 2016). The mechanisms which link diet
and delayed aging have four main pathways. First, LPHC diets influence nutrient
sensing pathways such as sirtuins (SIRTs) mechanistic target of mTOR, AMPK and
insulin/insulin growth factor (IGF-1)/growth hormone (GH) (Simpson and Raubenheimer 2005). An LPHC diet increases AMPK and SIRTs while reducing mTOR
and insulin/IGF-1/GH levels. Increased AMPK and SIRTs and reduced mTOR and

insulin/IGF-1/GH improve cellular processes related with aging such as mitochondrial biogenesis, autophagy, cellular metabolism, oxidative stress, genome maintenance, and protein synthesis. Those pathways enable organisms to survive periods of
food shortages by transferring resources from reproduction to survival and cellular
maintenance (David et al. 2016).
On the other hand, as mentioned above, the type of carbohydrate in the diet plays a
vital role regarding impact on health. Some studies have shown that glucose-enriched
diets shorten lifespan via various pathways (Mortuza et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2013a,
b;Leeetal. 2017).Inparticular,humanendothelialcellsandfibroblastsarenegatively
affected by a high glucose diet (Lee et al. 2017). In human studies, it was determined
that glucose-enriched diets increase some types of aging-related phenotypes such as
increased levels of senescence-associated (SA) β-gal staining, decreased proliferation, irregular morphology, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS). SIRTs have
been shown to be associated with glucose-induced accelerated cellular aging. It has
been shown that glucose-enriched diets suppress and down-regulate SIRTs (Mortuza
et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2013a, b). Also, it has been demonstrated that high dietary
glucose activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK); thus, this enzyme
accelerates the senescence of human endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Additionally, with the presence of high glucose levels, cellular aging phenotypes such as SA
β-gal staining levels increased while cellular proliferation reduced; thus, p38 MAPK


-----

is activated in EPCs. Restoration of aging phenotypes has been demonstrated when
treated with p38 MAPK inhibitors. Thus, it is proposed that p38 MAPK mediates the
pro-aging consequences of high glucose levels (Kuki et al. 2006). Another study, by
Micó et al. (2017), also found that high glucose levels trigger insulin release, which
then causes an increase in IGF-1. At that point, IGF-1 binds to its receptor and causes
autophosphorylation to switch on, leading to the following activation of PI3K: PI3K
phosphorylates and activates protein kinase B (AKT). Activated AKT phosphorylates and activates mTOR and inhibits FOXO. Thus, an increase in glucose levels
affects this signaling cascade. Hereby, for optimal health, longevity, and aging, the
amount and especially the type of dietary carbohydrates play a critical role (Ludwig
et al. 2018).
###### **2.3 Effects of Carbohydrates on Aging and Longevity**

Carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, known as macronutrients, are sources of energy, yet
they also have various other physiological functions (Carreiro et al. 2016). Recent
studies show that the composition and balance of macronutrients have a greater
effect on the extension of human life than does total energy intake (Mair et al. 2005;
Solon-Biet et al. 2015a, b). U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and
U.S. Department of Agriculture (2015) 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recently established a new approach to the recommended dietary intake of
macronutrients. According to the 2015–2020 Dietary Guideline for Americans, the
dietary reference intakes for carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are 45–65, 25–35, and
10–30% of calories, respectively (IOM 2015; Buyken et al. 2018). The Prospective
Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities
(ARIC) studies, two large-scale and long-term follow up epidemiological studies,
examined the effect of carbohydrates on mortality and lifespan. According to PURE
study results, high carbohydrate intake is associated with a higher risk of mortality,
whereas ARIC study results indicated a U-shaped association between carbohydrate intake and all-cause mortality, with 50–55% carbohydrate intake linked to the
longest lifespan (Dehghan et al. 2017; Seidelmann et al. 2018). Another cohort study
had parallel findings with the ARIC study, showing U-shaped association between
carbohydrate intake and all-cause mortality along with finding that a 50–60% carbohydrate intake, which is accepted as a moderate intake of dietary carbohydrates,
lowered all-cause mortality risk (Kwon et al. 2020). A meta-analysis comprising
17 cohort studies on dietary carbohydrate intake and mortality reported that low
dietary carbohydrates is associated with an increased risk of mortality (Noto et al.
2013). Therefore, it can be suggested that both low carbohydrate intake of <40%
and high carbohydrate intake of >70% both cause a rise in mortality risk compared
to a moderate intake of 50–60%. In fact, these percentage ranges are dependent on
dietary patterns in such a way that in low-carbohydrate diets, an increase in animal fat
and protein intake is observed with the change in dietary pattern (Ludwig et al. 2018;
Seidelmann et al. 2018). Specifically, it has been shown that a low carbohydrate diet


-----

causes an increase intake of animal fat and protein; thus, a decrease in carbohydrate
intake leads to a decrease in vegetable protein and dietary fibre intake. Therefore,
studies have drawn attention to the importance of the type of dietary fat and protein
that should be consumed in a low-carbohydrate diet and concluded that while a
low carbohydrate diet based on animal sources is associated with higher mortality
risk, a vegetable-based low carbohydrate diet is associated with lower mortality risk
(Ludwig et al. 2018; Seidelmann et al. 2018; Shamima et al. 2020). Some clinical
studies have reported that short-term low-carbohydrate diets have a greater effect
on weight loss than do low-fat diets. While it is thought that body weight loss may
improve lifespan indirectly, in the long term, due to low compliance, the efficiency
of this diet decreases (Hu 2015; Mancini et al. 2016; Mansoor et al. 2016). The
DIETFITs randomized clinical study demonstrated that low-carbohydrate diets for
weight loss did not provide a significant advantage over low-fat diets, yet suggested
limiting sugar, refined grains, and processed foods in both diet types. Regarding the
effect of carbohydrate type and amount on health outcomes, the study concluded that
the type of carbohydrate is more important than the total amount of carbohydrate
consumed (Gardner et al. 2018).
The Okinawan diet, shown to be among the healthiest eating models, emphasizes
the importance of the amount of carbohydrates as well as the carbohydrate type on
healthoutcomes.ThelongevityadvantageoftheOkinawandietisprimarilyattributed
to the healthy lifestyles of its adherents. That lifestyle includes a traditional diet which
is energy-restricted but nutritionally dense, and especially rich in vitamins, minerals,
and phytonutrients, many of which have nutraceutical potential (Willcox et al. 2014).
In the traditional Okinawan diet, 85% of energy is provided by carbohydrates, 9% by
protein, and 6% by total dietary fat (saturated fat 2%) (Willcox et al. 2007), whereas
in the modern Okinawan diet, the energy derived from carbohydrates is about 58%,
while 15% comes from protein and 28% from dietary fat (7% saturated fat). (Willcox
et al. 2014). At this point, it is useful to know the principles and characteristics of the
traditional Okinawan diet and to determine the dietary pattern of it. The typical characteristics of the Okinawan diet are as follows: low energy intake; high amount of
vegetable consumption, especially root and green-yellow vegetables; high consumption of legumes, especially soy; reasonable consumption of fish; low consumption of
meat and dairy products; low fat intake; mostly low glycemic index carbohydrates
and high fibre foods; and moderate alcohol consumption (Willcox et al. 2014). It
can be observed that the Okinawan diet has similar constructive effects on health as

the Mediterranean diet; both diets underline the importance of moderate carbohydrate (50–60%) consumption of the type of carbohydrates consumed. Although the
amount of carbohydrates is significant, the importance of the carbohydrate type on
health outcomes should be emphasized (Willcox et al. 2014; Seidelmann et al. 2018;
Ekmekcioglu 2020). This finding is supported by two meta-analyses indicating that
the risk of all-cause mortality decreased with a Mediterranean-type diet comprising
moderate carbohydrate consumption (50–60%) and high fibre intake via vegetables
and fruits as well as whole grain products as carbohydrate sources (Bonaccio et al.
2018; Eleftheriou et al. 2018).

2 Carbohydrates as Nutritional Components for Health and Longevity 45

As a result, both low and high carbohydrate intake was associated with mortality
risk, while the minimum risk of mortality was found to be linked with 50–60%
carbohydrate intake. It has been reported that compared to a high carbohydrate
diet, low-carbohydrate diets are associated with a higher risk of death due to the
increased intake of animal-derived proteins and the accompanying increase in dietary
fat sources. However, it has also been shown that protein and dietary fats are associated with lower mortality rates when obtained from plant sources such as vegetables,
nuts, and whole grains. In this case, it is thought that the type of carbohydrates derived
from staple foods significantly affects mortality rate (Virtanen et al. 2019; Chen et al.
2020).
###### **2.4 Relation Between Carbohydrate Types, Health,** **and Longevity** ***2.4.1 Dietary Fibre***

Nutritional interventions and dietary patterns have a very critical role in the managementofaging.Dietaryfibreisknownasnon-digestiblecomplexcarbohydrates.Many
clinicalandepidemiologicalstudieshaveshownthatdietaryfibre,especiallyathigher
intakes, reduces many age-related diseases and therefore the risk of mortality. Studies
have confirmed that dietary fibre intake causes a decrease in inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters, and this improves health in the aging process and prolongs
lifespan (Huang et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2018; Reynolds et al. 2019). In fact, an
insufficient amount of dietary fibre has been proven to speed up the aging process. A
substantial intake of dietary fibre is an essential element of healthy aging (Abdolghaffari et al. 2020). Fibre increases the feeling of satiety through various mechanisms
and also regulates carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. In the large intestine, fibre is
almost completely broken down by the resident microbiota in a series of anaerobic
reactions known as fermentation. The gut microbiota play an important role and
improve human health, including protection against pathogens, enhancement of the
immune system, vitamin synthesis, and metabolism of xenobiotics (Alasmar et al.
2019). Whole grain products, one of the greatest food sources of fibre, are made
up of a variety of components including germ, endosperm, and bran. The bran and
germ contain phytochemicals, while the endosperm contains a high amount of starch
(Zhang et al. 2018; Reynolds et al. 2019). It is thought that whole grain products,
with high fibre, mineral, and antioxidant content—which certainly advance human
health—provide individuals a means to maintain a healthy body weight, improve
metabolism, and suppress inflammation (Huang et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2018).
A cohort study has indicated that a fibre-rich diet reduces all-cause mortality
(Dominguez et al. 2019). In addition, some studies have shown that especially highfibre diets have a potential to decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, type
2 diabetes mellitus, and some type of cancers (Aune et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2013a,

b; Yao et al. 2014; Micha et al. 2017; Song et al. 2018). Mechanisms by which high
fibre consumption may reduce the risk of these diseases include: reducing postprandial glucose responses (Gibb et al. 2015); prevention of obesity through an increased
feeling of satiety (Emilien et al. 2017); decreasing intestinal absorption of cholesterol (Hartley et al. 2016); reducing inflammatory parameters such as C-reactive
protein, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (Krishnamurthy et al. 2012;
Jiao et al. 2015; Gibb et al. 2015; Monfort-Pires and Ferreira 2016; Emilien et al.
2017, Hartley et al. 2016). Recent years have brought emphasis on another mechanism, the fermentation of dietary fibre by gut microbiota. Due to the fermentation
of dietary fibre, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are produced; thus, those SCFAs
act as anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents (Sonnenburg and Backhed
2016; Donovan 2017). Huang et al. (2015) also found higher dietary fibre intake
to be associated with lower all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease, cancer,
and ischemic heart disease mortality. For each 10 g per day increase in dietary fibre
intake, mortality rate was lowered by 11% for all-cause mortality, by 17% for cardiovascular disease, by 9% for cancer, by 20% for coronary heart disease, and by 34%
for ischemic heart disease. Dominguez et al. (2019) showed an inverse relationship
between total dietary fibre intake and overall mortality risks, determining that each
additional intake of 5 g/1000 kcal of dietary fibre was related with a 9% reduction in
all-cause mortality. They also examined the sources of dietary fibre on mortality risk
as well as the impact of soluble and insoluble fibre on the risk of all-cause mortality. In
terms of dietary fibre sources, while a significant inverse relation was observed with
the fibre derived from vegetables, there was no significant relation found between
fibre derived from fruits, legumes, cereals, or other sources. Comparing soluble fibre
versus insoluble fibre, they showed inverse significant associations for both soluble
and insoluble dietary fibre and all-cause mortality, with a slightly stronger relation
for soluble fibre (Dominguez et al. 2019).
The systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort and randomized controlled trials on carbohydrate quality and health which had the largest
dataset indicated that dietary fibre intake exhibits 15–30% reduction in all-cause
and cardiovascular-related mortality. Correspondingly, from the prospective cohort
data, the incidence of coronary heart disease, stroke and mortality, type 2 diabetes,
and colorectal cancer were also reduced by 15–30% when comparing the highest
dietary fibre consumers with the lowest consumers. It has been demonstrated that
important, positive health consequences were greatest when daily fibre consumption
was between 25 and 29 g. The meta-analysis also reported that higher fibre intake
led to even more positive results in protection from cardiovascular diseases, type 2
diabetes, and colorectal cancer. Dose–response data showed that above 30 g per day
conferred further benefits (Reynolds et al. 2019). Kim and Je (2014) also indicated
that total mortality risk was 23% lower in the highest category of dietary fibre intake
(average 26.9 g/day) compared to lowest (15 g/day) intake. In addition, in terms of
dietary sources of fibre, they specified that vegetable and, especially, cereal fibre
were meaningfully linked with lower total mortality while fruit fibre did not show
any effect.

###### ***2.4.2 Added and Free Sugar***

Added sugars are sugars added to foods during processing or preparation. They
includecornsyrup,dextrose,fructose,glucose,sucrose,andhigh-fructosecornsyrup.
Free sugars include added sugars as well as sugars that occur naturally in juiced or
pureed fruit and vegetables (Mela and Woolner 2018). The World Health Organisation (2015) recommends obtaining <10% of daily energy from free sugars intake.
A dietary pattern which includes foods rich in sugar is associated with increased
mortality (Kiefte-de Jung et al. 2014). A recent prospective cohort study conducted
in the United Kingdom indicated a linear correlation between sugar intake and cardiovascular diseases, and mortality risk is lower with sugar intake accounting for 5–20%
of energy compared to 35% (Ho et al. 2020). Another prospective cohort study among
the Swedish population demonstrated a U-shaped correlation between added sugar
intake and cardiovascular and cancer mortality, while added sugar intake at >20%
of energy has been linked to a 30% increase in mortality. Added sugar sources
including sugar-sweetened beverages are also related with increased mortality risk
(Ramne et al. 2019). Moreover, in a United States cohort, sugar-sweetened beverages
positively related with total, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality (Malik et al. 2019).
A study among adults in the US demonstrated that cardiovascular disease mortality
risk is increased 1.3-fold and 2.75-fold as a result of added sugar intake at 10–24.9%
and ≥25% of energy, respectively (Yang et al. 2014). In addition, a retrospective
cohort study observed that added sugar is most predictive of all-cause mortality
(Shah et al. 2018). A meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies demonstrated a
nonlinear association between total sugars, added sugars, fructose, and cardiovascular diseases mortality (Khan et al. 2019). Furthermore, it has been suggested that
there is a positive association between added sugar intake, in particular through sugarsweetened beverages, and obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease, and cardiovascular mortality (Haque et al. 2020). The reasons for these
pathologies are explained by a term of carbotoxicity. Increased excess fructose intake
is one of the featured reasons for carbotoxicity (Kroemer et al. 2018). Fructose is
naturally contained in fruit, but excess intake is related with increased intake of
high-fructose corn syrup. Excess fructose increases de novo lipogenesis and thus
triglyceride and LDL levels in circulation. Also, it causes mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress due to ATP depletion and increased uric
acid production. Consequently, these mechanisms of action possibly lead to chronic
disease such as obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, gout, non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease, and aging (Dornas et al. 2015; Hannou et al. 2018). To sum up, lowering
added and free sugars intake can cause a decrease in non-communicable chronic
diseases and mortality risk, and may retard aging by prevention of oxidative stress
and inflammatory processes which induce aging mechanisms such as senescence and
organelle dysfunctions.

###### **2.5 Conclusion**

In conclusion, a growing body of evidence and research shows that carbohydrate
quality appears to have more important role in public health than the amount of
carbohydrates consumed. Concerning the level of carbohydrate intake and health
consequences, both high and low carbohydrate consumption were associated with
increased mortality; thus, moderate (50–60% of total energy) intake is recommended.
Also, carbohydrate type is related with non-communicable chronic disease risk and
mortality. Consumption of added and free sugars is especially related to obesity,
diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Sufficient intake of fibre-rich sources such as
non-starchy vegetables, whole fruits, whole grains, and legumes generally works to
reduce the alarming rate of chronic diseases and its derived mortality. Data suggests
that both quality and quantity of carbohydrates notably modifies health, aging, and
longevity.

#### **Fats and Oils for Health and Longevity**

**Kaustuv Bhattacharya and Suresh I. S. Rattan**

**Abstract** Fats and oils are one of the three primary nutritional components, and

###### **3.1 Introduction**

Fats and oils are the third primary nutritional component after proteins and carbohydrates, and they deliver essential fatty acids (FA) vitally important for the normal
biological structure and physiological functions. Fats have the highest caloric density
among foodstuffs (9 kcal/g), and are also the solubilizers and carriers of vitamins
A, D, E and K. Our intake of oils and fats is largely through cooking- and saladoils; butter, margarines and other spreads; baked and fried products; dairy-products
includingmilk, cheese, desserts, chocolateandsugar confectionery; andthroughculinary applications, such as mayonnaise and other dressings. Fats are also consumed
as a part of the animal-based foods. All these sources make up a complex matrix

of various visible and invisible oils and fats that end up in our body (Bhattacharya
2006).
Oils and fats contribute to both the textural-structural properties of the food,
and organoleptic aspects including flavor, mouthfeel, palatability and appearance.
Food additives such as emulsifiers and hydrocolloids play an ever-increasing role in
providing the structural integrity in processed foods to deliver lubrication, enhance
and stabilization of aeration, crumb structure etc., and also contribute to the shelf-life
of such foods (Bhattacharya 2006).
The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the chemical nature and
composition of fats and oils, their biological functions, their metabolic pathways of
synthesis and catabolism, and dietary guidelines for their consumption for a healthy
and possibly a longer life.
###### **3.2 Terminology and Chemical Composition of Fats** **and Oils**

Before describing the chemical nature and composition of fats and oils, it may
be useful to clarify some terminology. FA are the basic unit of all fats and oils.
Lipids are the compounds based on fatty acids or on closely related compounds,
such as the corresponding alcohols or the sphingosine base, and are mainly, but not
entirely, mixtures of triacylglycerols (often termed triglycerides). Collectively, these
are known as oils or fats, depending on whether, at a room temperature of about 24 [°] C,
they are liquid or solid, respectively. Often these terms are used interchangeably, and
so one should be cautiously aware and precise about these.
The broad group of lipids can be subdivided into classes based on their chemical
structure, for example diacylglycerols, phosphatidylethanolamines, ceramides and
others. They can be further separated into individual molecular species based on their
acyl groups. Fats and oils of animal and plant origin consist almost exclusively of
triglycerides, which consist of a glycerol moiety with each hydroxyl group esterified
to a fatty acid. Triacylglycerols are synthesized by enzyme systems, which determine
that a centre of asymmetry is created about carbon-2 of the glycerol backbone, so they
exist in enantiomeric forms, that is with different fatty acids in each position. The
positions of the fatty acids in the glycerol backbone are denoted by sn-1 or sn-3, the
two terminal positions and sn-2, the middle position. (The abbreviation ‘sn’ stands for
‘stereospecific numbering’). The naturally occurring fatty acids are mainly straightchain compounds containing an even number of carbon atoms, and can be grouped
into three classes, (i) saturated; (ii) monounsaturated and polyunsaturated; and (iii)
branched chain. Unsaturated fatty acids may contain one or more double or triple
bonds and can be classified as monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and acetylenic. FA
composition and distribution of triacylglycerols can be altered via a process called
interesterification for a specific ratio of n-3, n-6, n-9 and saturated FA (SFAs), which
play an important role in lowering cholesterol and blood lipid levels leading (Akoh
2002).

###### ***3.2.1 Saturated Fatty Acids (SFA)***

SFA are composed of straight-chain FA esterified to the glycerol backbone. Among
the most common and commercially available vegetable oils, such as coconut oil,
palm kernel oil and palm oil, the most common SFA are lauric (C12), myristic (C14),
palmitic (C16) FA. Presence of stearic acid (C18) is quite low (often below 5%) in
common vegetable oils and fats. Dairy fats contain C4 to C10 FA while longer chain
SFA up to C38 are found in waxes (Bhattacharya and Rattan 2006). ***3.2.2 Monounsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFA)***

The most abundant MUFA in common liquid vegetable oils such as olive, canola,
sunflower, peanut, and safflower is oleic acid, a FA with one unsaturation or one
double bond at the 9 [th] carbon atom from the methyl end. Oleic acid is the precursor of
biosynthesis of omega-9 class of FA. There are also high oleic varieties of sunflower,
canola and soybean oil developed via selective breeding and genetic modification
techniques (Kristott 2003). ***3.2.3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA)***

FA with two or more unsaturation or double bonds in the carbon chain are known as

PUFA, and the two major PUFA families are linoleic acid (delta-9,12–18:2 omega6), and alpha-linolenic acid (delta-9,12,15–18:3 omega-3). These two class of PUFA
are considered as essential FA as they cannot be synthesized *in vivo* by humans,
and so the dietary intake of linolenic and linoleic acids is commonly via canola,
soybean, sunflower, flaxseed and corn oils. Once linoleic and linolenic acids are
consumed, they undergo elongation and desaturation via enzymatic pathways into
higher monologues such as arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4, omega-6), eicosapentaenoic
acid (EPA, 20:5, omega-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6, omega-3). EPA
and DHA are the most bioavailable forms of omega-3 for humans. (Murphy and
Howe 2008). ***3.2.4 Trans Fatty Acids (TFA)***

Various health-detrimental effects of TFA have been extensively documented over the
last two decades. The double-bond geometry of TFA is in the trans (E) configuration
as the hydrogen atoms are placed on the opposite sides of the double bond (Hunter
1992; Hastert 1996). While dairy fats contain small amounts of naturally occurring


-----

56 K. Bhattacharya and S. I. S. Rattan

TFA, it is the industrially-produced TFA during the process of partial hydrogenation
that has been studied the most. However, fully hydrogenated oils have less than 2%
TFA and are often considered as zero trans. The use of partially hydrogenated oils
have also been removed from food application in most parts of the world.
###### **3.3 Physiological Functions of Fats and Oils**

The physiological functions of lipids include storing energy, inter- and intra-cellular
signaling, and being the structural components of the cell membranes, and are briefly
discussed below. In addition, some vitamins, for example vitamins A, D, E and K,
require fats for getting dissolved and becoming bioavailable as essential micronutrients stored in the liver and other fatty tissues. The major sources of energy storage
in adipose tissue, both in animals and plants, are triglycerides. Lipases in the body
regularly synthesize and break down the adipocytes or fat cells, and oxidation of FA
provides high caloric content (about 9 kcal/g or 38 kJ/g), compared with 4 kcal/g or
17 kJ/g obtained from the breakdown of carbohydrates and proteins.
The role of FA in the composition of eukaryotic cell membranes is crucial. In
animal cells, the intracellular components are physically separated from the extracellular environment by the plasma membrane. The main structural components of
the cellular plasma membrane and the intracellular membranes of organelles are glycerophospholipids along with non-glyceride lipid components namely, sphingomyelin
and sterols (Stryer et al 2007). It is often considered that the formation of lipids into
protocell membranes was a key step in the origin of life (Segré et al 2001).
Another important physiological function of FA is the lipid-based signaling in
cellular functioning (Wang 2004). Lipid signaling is initiated by the activation of G
protein-coupled nuclear receptors, and several different lipid categories are identified
as the signaling molecules acting as the messengers (Eyster 2007). Such signaling
molecules include ceraminde-derived sphingosine-1-phosphate, which is involved in
the regulation of calcium mobilization (Hinkovska-Galcheva et al 2008), cell growth,
and apoptosis. Other examples of signaling molecules are diacylglycerols (DAG),
phosphatidylinositol phosphates, prostaglandins and phosphatidylserines involved
in the signaling for the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells or other broken components
of cells (Saddoughi et al 2008). **3.4 Lipid Metabolism**

Triglycerides, sterols and phospholipids from animals and plants are the main dietary
sources. Lipid metabolism includes the production and the degradation of lipids
inside the cells both for the production of energy and for the synthesis of structural
and functional lipids. However, unlike long chain-PUFAs, very long chain PUFAs


-----

3 Fats and Oils for Health and Longevity 57

are generally not obtained from the ordinary dietary sources, and therefore need to
be synthesized *in situ* from shorter FA precursors.
Lipids being hydrophobic molecules, require solubilization before being
metabolised. In comparison, PUFA are more readily mobilized and oxidized than
other fats. PUFA also have an influence on gene expression and appetite-controlling
peptides, providing some protective value against obesity. The initial step of lipid
metabolism is enzymatic hydrolysis of the triglycerides into its constituent FA in the
digestive system. This is followed by the absorption of the FA into the epithelial cells
of the intestinal wall where FA are packaged and transported to the rest of the body.
The processes of lipid digestion begin with lingual lipases starting the breakdown
of dietary fats in the mouth. However, cholesterols from the food are not broken
down by the lipases and generally remain intact until they reach the epithelium of
the small intestine. The chemical digestion of fats continues by gastric lipases and
the mechanical digestion, peristalsis, begins. In the small intestine, pancreatic lipases
and bile salt-dependent lipases help breakdown the triglycerides along with further
mechanical digestion. Triglycerides are finally converted into individual FA units
and are absorbed into the small intestine’s cells (Voet et al 2013).
Fat absorption is the next step in lipid metabolism. The triglycerides moieties FA
and glycerol along with cholesterol, aggregate into colloidal structures (micelles)
before diffusing across the membrane to enter the intestinal epithelial cells. Monoglycerides and FA resynthesize triglycerides in the cytosol of epithelial cells, forming
clusters of bigger particles called chylomicrons which are amphipathic structures that
transport digested lipids as they travel through the bloodstream to enter adipose and
other tissues in the body (Jo et al 2016).
Transportation of lipids between organs in an aqueous environment is facilitated
by lipoproteins, which are complexes of lipids with specific apoproteins. Such transportation process through blood is necessary because of the hydrophobic character of
membrane lipids, triglycerides and cholesterols. The lipoprotein lipase breaks down
the lipoproteins in the luminal surface of endothelial cells in capillaries, and triglycerides are released, which are then next split into FA and glycerol before entering
the cells, and the remaining cholesterol travels through the blood to the liver. The
glycerol is converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, and is subsequently oxidized
for production of energy while long chain FA are converted to fatty acyl-CoA in
order to pass across the mitochondria membrane (Feingold and Grunfeld 2000).
Triglyerides, membrane lipids and cholesterols can also be synthesized by the
organisms through various pathways. Biosynthesis of glycerophospholipids and
sphingolipids, the two main classes of membrane lipids occurs in the endoplasmic
reticulum membrane. The first step is synthesis of sphingosine or glycerol as the
backbone followed by the esterification of fatty acids to the backbone to make phosphatidic acid, which is further altered with the attachment of different hydrophilic
head groups to the backbone (Gault et al 2010; Choe et al 2016). Triglyceride biosynthesis occurs in the cytosol via phosphatidic acid which acts as a precursor (Lok et al
1976). Cholesterol biosynthesis occurs in the cytosol of liver cells from acetyl-CoA
through a multiple-step pathway known as isoprenoid pathway.

###### ***3.4.1 Sources of Lipids – Natural and Prepared Foods***

Oils extracted from crops such as soybean, canola, sunflower, safflower, corn, palm,
palm kernel, coconut, etc. are widely used in food items, including baked and fried
products, margarines and spreads, chocolate and various other confectionery products, ice creams, salad dressings and mayonnaise. Individual oils may be used in
these applications, or two or more oils may be blended in defined proportions with
or without modification. Such wide array of oils and fats provide us with a diverse
range of FA which fall into the categories as mentioned earlier.
Table 3.1 gives a comparative list of FA composition of common vegetable oils.
Only by understanding the relative importance and the health-beneficial or healthdamaging effects of various FA, one can choose among various sources according
to one’s needs and preferences. **3.5 Guidelines for Fat Intake**

With the globalization of internet and social media, the way consumers obtain
nutrition information has changed dramatically. This has also vastly contributed
to conflicting information of uncertain and variable quality leading to confusion in
many cases. One prominent example is the erroneous understanding and belief about
dietary fats leading to its general avoidance.
For years, an emphasis of nutrition communication was to balance calorie intake
and energy expenditure, and to decrease dietary fat intake. Reductions in total dietary
fat were recommended to reduce saturated fat, trans fat with the overall aim of
reducing calorie consumption. However, this resulted in an unintentional negative

health consequences. Reduction of fat in industrially produced food often led to its
substitution with refined carbohydrates and added sugars, which led to significant
increases in total energy intake and obesity rates (Liu et al 2017). In addition, it led
to avoidance of nutrient-dense foods rich in healthy unsaturated fats such as nuts,
seeds, avocados and vegetable oils.
###### ***3.5.1 Current Recommendations for Dietary Fat Intake***

Various national and international health organizations have put forward guidelines
on dietary fat intake, as summarized in Tables 3.2 and 3.3. Dietary guidelines from
the World Health Organization and other health organizations recommend a total
fat intake between 20 and 35% of total calories. The minimum of 20% is to ensure

adequate consumption of total energy, essential fatty acids, and fat-soluble vitamins
and prevent atherogenic dyslipidemia which occurs with low-fat, high carbohydrate
diets and increases risk of coronary heart disease. Table 3.2 shows the recommended
percent of energy from fats as recommended by various organizations and institutions; and Table 3.3 lists the recommended levels of n-3 LC-PUFA as per various
international organizations. These guidelines are as per 2017 (Liu et al 2017).

###### **3.6 Lipidome During Aging**

More than 75% of the human metabolome is represented by lipids, and the complete
set of all biological lipids is called lipidome (Ejsing et al 2009; Psychogios et al
2011). The plasma lipidome consists of thousands of lipids performing different
functions and having different structures (Almeida et al 2021). Changes in dietary
lipid intake during aging would influence the plasma or serum lipidome. For example,
there is a correlation between the FA ingested in the diet and the phospholipids of
the cell membranes and the TG of the adipose tissue and plasma (Abbott et al 2012).
These studies also showed that whereas dietary SFA, MUFA and PUFA did not
significantly influence membrane lipids, the composition of TG in adipose tissue
and plasma appeared to be influenced in accordance with the dietary FA (Almeida
et al 2021).
During ageing, there is a gradual decrease in the total intake of lipids. More
specifically, there is an increase in the intake of SFA and a decrease in the intake of
MUFA and PUFA (Almeida et al 2021). With regard to PUFAs, there appears to be
a deficit in the intake of omega-3-PUFA, such as α-linoleic acid, eicosapentaenoic
acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the elderly (Carrière et al 2007).
This specific group of PUFA is extremely important as it has numerous benefits.
For example, omega3-PUFA are associated with the maintenance of bone health and
muscle tone, inhibition of TG synthesis in the liver, decrease of the inflammatory
processes, and decrease in the cognitive performance decline associated with aging
(Almeida et al 2021).v
Due to the central role that lipids play in the body, changes in their metabolic
pathways can lead to the development of diseases, such as atherosclerosis, DM2,
arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases.


-----

3 Fats and Oils for Health and Longevity 61

A comprehensive description of the age-related changes in the lipid profiles during
normal ageing and pathological situations in old age is available in Almeida et al
(2021). Currently, there are several dietary supplements marketed with the claims of
increasing the plasma levels of omega3-PUFA (mainly EPA and DHA); and often,
these omega3-PUFA used in supplements are derived from fish oils (Almeida et al
2021). However, to what extent such food supplements can slow down or reverse
age-related changes in lipidome is presently not well demonstrated.
###### **3.7 Conclusion**

Ourdailydietismadeupofacomplexmixofoilsandfatsfrombothvegetable,animal
and marine sources. Fats and oils are essential for our health and survival at all ages,
and no single category of FA can be labelled as good or bad in its entirety. Of course,
any imbalance between the amounts of FA and the physiological requirements of the
body can lead to health problems and several diseases. Therefore, a focus should be
maintained on consumption of balanced intake between saturated, monounsaturated
and polyunsaturated rich oils in accordance with the needs of the body at different
stages of life. In future, more focus will be put on personalized diet that fits the
individual blood lipid profiling (Almeida et al 2021).
In case of industrially-produced food products, the consumer has only a limited
say in deciding the oils and fats used in the application. Selection of these oils and fats
is based on their contribution to the texture, structure and organoleptic properties of
the food item. Declaration on the nutritional labels and guideline recommendations
as mentioned in the above tables could be useful. One should also consider proper
protection of mono- and polyunsaturated oils against oxidation. Consumption of
recommended calories from carbohydrates, proteins and oils and fats, regular physical activity, maintenance of proper food safety and personal hygiene all contribute
to health and longevity.

##### **Chapter 4**
#### **Micronutrients in Ageing and Longevity**

**Božena Curko-Cofek** **[´]**

**Abstract** Ageing is a biological process that can be described as the accumulation
of molecular damage to cells in response to stress. A tendency in modern society
is to optimize longevity by trying to minimize a physical and mental decline and
to decrease susceptibility to disease. There are some nutritional factors, including
micronutrients, which can support this process of successful ageing. Micronutrients are vitamins (e.g., A, B group, C, D, E, folate) and minerals (e.g., copper,
iron, magnesium, selenium, zinc), needed in small amounts but essential for healthy
living. They have numerous significant functions in the organism as antioxidants,
coenzymes, cofactors in metabolism, and genetic control. Therefore, micronutrients contribute to the normal functions of the immune, nervous, and endocrine
system, protect the organism from oxidative stress, thus contributing to longevity
and successful ageing. The dietary intake of micronutrients is usually insufficient
in the elderly due to low income, reduced mobility, oral health problems, intestinal
malabsorption, presence of chronic diseases, and changes in cognition. The result is
an inadequate status of micronutrients which may contribute to suppressed immunity
and consequent predisposition to infections, cognitive decline, neurodegeneration,
development of the cardiovascular disease, disturbance of immune response and
other health disorders.

the micronutrients, only vitamin D is produced in the body while the rest must be
taken from the diet (Celep et al. 2017). The appropriate intake of the recommended
amounts is important since micronutrients deficiency can have severe consequences
for health.

The elderly population is particularly at risk of micronutrients deficiencies. They
undergo many physiological changes which decrease their energy requirements. At
the same time, the requirements for micronutrients are the same as for younger
adults (Kehoe et al. 2019). There are also many other limiting factors in access
and consummation of nutrient-reach food for the elderly. Some of them are low
income, reduced mobility, oral health problems, and changes in taste, smell, and
cognition (Marsman et al. 2018). Furthermore, in older age, most people have chronic
diseases. The presence of disease can affect the need for calories and micronutrients
(Marian and Sacks 2009). Medications used in the treatment of chronic diseases can
be nutrient wasting and cause a decrease in the status of micronutrients essential for
health (Marsman et al. 2018).
Micronutrient deficiency makes the older individuals a higher risk group in the
body’s immune response and increased susceptibility to infection (Bourke et al.
2016). Recent researches suggest that micronutrients participate in immune functions through several mechanisms. Those mechanisms are maintenance of physical
barriers,productionofantimicrobialproteins,andregulationofimmunecellsactivity.
Vitamins A, C, E, and the trace element zinc contribute to the enhancement of the skin
barrier function. The vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D, E, folic acid, and the trace elements
iron, zinc, copper, and selenium synergistically support the protective activities of
the immune cells. All these micronutrients, except vitamin C and iron, are essential
for antibody production. Therefore, the inadequate status of mentioned vitamins and
trace elements may result in suppressed immunity and consequent predisposition to
infections (Maggini et al. 2007).
Combined effects of ageing and insufficient intake of micronutrients contribute
to cognitive decline, development of cardiovascular disease, disturbance of immune
response and other health disorders. Uncontrolled use of dietary supplements can also
have detrimental effects on health (Watson et al. 2018). Therefore, it is necessary
to maintain an appropriate balance between the need for micronutrients and their
intake, as shown in Table 4.1.
There is a tendency in modern society to optimize longevity by trying to minimize
a physical and mental decline (Bowling and Dieppe 2005). This process of successful
ageing depends on several factors. Some of them, such as genetic background, cannot
be modified. In contrast, social, cultural, or lifestyle choices can be influenced (Porter
et al. 2016). The ageing process can be described as the accumulation of molecular
damage to cells in response to stress. Among other exogenous factors, there are
some nutrition components that can modify the rate of damage (Sofi et al. 2008). For
instance, the trace elements from the food can modulate the rate at which damage
accumulates in the cells. Also, they influence metabolic pathways, such as oxidative
and inflammatory processes, which alter during ageing (Meplan 2011). Therefore, we
can say that dietary, with pharmacological and lifestyle interventions, may promote
health and longevity.

###### **4.2 Vitamins**

Vitamins are organic substances that function as regulators in the body. They are
divided into two groups: fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, D, E and K) and watersoluble vitamins (vitamin B1, B2, B6, B12, C, folic acid, etc.) (Celep et al. 2017). ***4.2.1 Vitamin A***

Vitamin A includes several fat-soluble substances like retinol, retinyl palmitate, and
beta-carotene. There are two forms of vitamin A obtained through diet. From the
animal sources, preformed vitamin A (retinol, retinyl ester) is derived while provitamin A (beta-carotenoid) is derived from plants. For the use in biologic processes,
retinol and beta-carotenoid must be converted to biologically active forms, retinal
and retinoic acid (Moise et al. 2007).
Vitamin A has a great impact on the ageing process due to its role in immune
function and oxidative processes. Therefore, vitamin A deficiency is associated


-----

66 B. Curko-Cofek [´]

with a defective immune response to infection. The active form of vitamin A regulates immune cell differentiation and activates T cell responses. Recent researches
are trying to enlighten the role of vitamin A in the enhanced T cell response in
some diseases associated with ageing, such as cancer, infection, inflammation, and
immune-mediated diseases (Raverdeau and Mills 2014).
Theorganparticularlysusceptibletooxidativedamageisaneyeduetoitsexposure
to light and high metabolism (Rasmussen and Johnson 2013). Age-related macular
degeneration is one of the age-related degenerative diseases caused, among other
factors, by high oxidative stress (Gorusupudi et al. 2017). It is the second most
common cause of blindness after cataract in Europe (Bourne et al. 2018). Vitamin A
is one of the most effective vitamins (together with vitamins C and E) for reducing the
risk of macular degeneration. It plays an essential role in the human retinal pigment
epithelial cells. Carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin are concentrated in the macula
and therefore known as macular pigments. They are the most potent antioxidants for
the prevention and reduction of the risk of age-related macular degeneration. The
human body is not able to synthesize lutein and zeaxanthin. Therefore, they must be
obtained from the diet (Khoo et al. 2019).
The role of vitamin A in skin changes is also well studied. The ageing process
promotes imbalance of collagen homeostasis resulting in the wrinkled appearance
and atrophy of aged skin (Cole et al. 2018). The basis of this process is downregulation of type I collagen accumulation and promotion of collagen degradation.
Type I collagen is the major structural protein in the skin (Quan et al. 2011). Vitamin
A and its metabolites promote new deposition of collagen and prevent its degradation
by increasing type I procollagen and reducing matrix metalloproteinase-1 activity
(Bielli et al. 2019).
Retinoids play a significant role in the development and normal functions of the
human brain. Therefore, there is a great interest in potential therapeutic applications,
especially for Alzheimer’s disease (Das et al 2019). Alzheimer’s disease is the most
common neurodegenerative disease and the most common cause of dementia and loss
of memory in old adults (Andreeva et al. 2017). Retinoids inhibit the expression of
chemokines and neuroinflammatory cytokines in microglia and astrocytes, which are
activated in Alzheimer’s disease. Stimulation of retinoic acid receptors and retinoid
X receptors slows down the accumulation of amyloids, reduces neurodegeneration,
and thereby prevents pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (Das et al. 2019).
It is important to maintain the balance between the vitamin A intake and clearance
from the organism since the elderly may have difficulty clearing it (Bolzetta et al.
2015). Some of the manifestations of chronic vitamin A excess are fatigue, hair
loss, dry mucous membranes and skin, bone fractures, and abnormal liver function
(Marian and Sacks 2009).

###### ***4.2.2 Vitamin B***

B vitamins are a group of essential water-soluble vitamins which contribute to
normal physiological and biochemical functioning of the body. B vitamins include B1
(thiamine), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), B5 (pantothenic acid), B6 (pyridoxamine),
B7 (biotin), B9 (folate) and B12 (cobalamin). Vitamin B4 (choline) is not considered
as part of the B vitamins complex (Mikkelsen and Apostolopoulos 2018).
B vitamins have significant roles throughout life, from childhood to old age
(McNulty et al. 2019). As coenzymes, they participate in many enzymatic reactions
and metabolic processes, play a crucial role in the methylation cycle, synthesis and
repair of DNA and RNA, and maintenance of phospholipids. B vitamins are essential
for the normal function of the immune and nervous system and for maintaining the
cognitive functions (Mikkelsen and Apostolopoulos 2018).
Vitamin B deficiency within the ageing population can be caused by low intake
(B2, B9), malabsorption (B12) or increased requirement with ageing (B6) (Porter
et al. 2016). The ageing process affects absorption, transport, and metabolism of
B vitamins within the body. Some other factors can also contribute to B vitamin
deficiency such as interactions between drugs and nutrients, genetic disorders, and
some medical conditions (Mikkelsen and Apostolopoulos 2018).
Several diseases are connected to vitamin B deficiency, such as pellagra,
beriberi, and pernicious anaemia. Furthermore, vitamin B deficiency contributes
to neurocognitive disorders (Mitchell et al. 2014), immune dysfunction, inflammation (Mikkelsen et al. 2017), liver damage, peripheral neuropathy, and anaemia
(Mikkelsen et al 2016). In the older population, vitamin B deficiency is linked
to cardiovascular disorders, cognitive dysfunction, osteoporosis, and methylation
disorders (Porter et al. 2016). ***4.2.3 Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)***

Vitamin B1 is part of the coenzyme thiamine pyrophosphate (Mikkelsen and Apostolopoulos 2018). It has a crucial role in the normal function of the nervous
system because it participates in the generation of nerve impulses and synthesis
of neurotransmitters (Nemazannikova et al. 2017).
Deficiency of the vitamin B1 can cause neurological damage by the production of
free radicals and increased oxidative stress in the brain and neuronal tissue (Liu et al.
2017). The result is axonal damage, inadequate myelin production, and glutamatemediated excitotoxicity (Abdou and Hazell 2014). B1 deficiency also causes immune
effects through the T-cell infiltration and increased production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, leading to neuroinflammation. Neuroinflammation affects mitochondrial
function and increases oxidative stress which leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress


-----

68 B. Curko-Cofek [´]

(Wang et al. 2017). All these factors are included in the pathogenesis of ageingrelated diseases such as dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and
Huntington’s disease (Mikkelsen and Apostolopoulos 2018).
###### ***4.2.4 Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)***

Vitamin B2 is a powerful antioxidant involved in numerous oxidation/reduction
reactions in two coenzymatic forms, flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine
dinucleotide (Moore et al. 2018).
The free radical theory of ageing proposes aerobic metabolism as a cause of oxidative damage that accumulates in body cells and contributes to the ageing process
(Wickens 2001). Vitamin B2 acts as an antioxidant by preventing the lipid peroxidation and attenuating reperfusion oxidative injury (Ashoori and Saedisomeolia 2014).
Accordingly, riboflavin could be involved in prolonging the life span, but so far,
scientific research did not establish a strong link between riboflavin and slowing the
human ageing process.
Along with other B vitamins, riboflavin plays a role in slowing cognitive decline
and possibly reducing the risk of depression in ageing (Moore et al. 2018). Therefore, B2 deficiency in older adults is linked to reduced cognitive outcome, depression, personality changes and distinct alterations within the central nervous system
(Mikkelsen et al. 2016, 2016a). ***4.2.5 Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxamine)***

Vitamin B6 can be found in three forms: pyridoxine, pyridoxal and pyridoxamine. It
hasmanyessentialfunctionswithintheendocrine,neurologicalandimmunesystems.
A biologically active form of B6 is coenzyme pyridoxal-5 phosphate which, as a
cofactor, aids the synthesis of the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine
and GABA (Mikkelsen and Apostolopoulos 2018).
Pyridoxamine is an effective inhibitor of the formation of advanced glycation
end-products. The pathological complications of diabetes are directly related to the
effects of these nonenzymatic reactions between proteins and sugars (Ramis et al.
2019). The prevalence of diabetes is more than two times higher among elderly adults
compared to middle age or young adults (Cowie et al. 2009), and the incidence in
the older population is constantly growing (Narayan et al. 2006). A large portion
of the diabetes-related cost involves treating diabetes-related complications (ADA
2013). Several studies (Degenhardt et al. 2002; Murakoshi et al. 2009; Stitt et al.
2002) have shown that pyridoxamine has therapeutic effects on various complications of diabetes. Vitamin B6 forms stable complexes with metal ions that catalyze
the oxidative reactions taking place in the advanced stages of the protein glycation


-----

cascade (Adrover et al. 2008). It also reacts with reactive carbonyl compounds generated as by-products of protein glycation, thereby preventing further protein damage
(Voziyan et al. 2002).
Since the advanced glycation end-products have been linked to the increased
production of free radicals, they are implicated in causing tissue damage associated
with ageing. Advanced glycation end-products can be deposited anywhere within
the body and cause abnormal function of the organ or tissue, for example, cataract,
arthritis, nephrosis and plaque formation within the vessel wall (Voziyan and Hudson
2005).
###### ***4.2.6 Vitamin B9 (Folate)***

The term folates is commonly used for the entire family of compounds, naturally
occurring and synthetic variants. Vitamin B9 (folate, folic acid) has a vital role in the
normal functioning of the body. It is involved in immune response, brain function,
DNA synthesis, and it is inevitable for cell division. Without folate, cells cannot
divide and function (Craenen et al. 2020).
Folates play a key role in methylation reactions and DNA synthesis as one-carbon
carrier/donor (Imbard et al. 2013). It has been known for years that folic acid food
fortification and supplementation can reduce the prevalence of birth defects (Blom
et al. 2006). Furthermore, it has been noticed that in healthy individuals plasma folate
levels decrease while homocysteine levels increase with age, especially between the
age of 40 and 90 years (Magnus et al. 2009). Increased homocysteine cytotoxicity has
been conferred to have a role in ageing, neuronal plasticity, and neurodegenerative
diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease
(Obeid and Herrmann 2006; Kalani et al. 2014).
Dementia and depression are considered to be major disorders of ageing (WHO
2016).Folatedeficiencyhasbeenconnectedtocognitivedeclineandmemorydeficits.
Apart from that, folate deficiency can affect the duration and clinical severity of
depression. Also, it is associated with a weaker response to antidepressant medication
(Reynolds 2006). ***4.2.7 Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)***

Vitamin B12 is necessary for the normal function of the nervous system, nerve cell
maintenance, cell proliferation and survival, and breakdown of fatty acids and amino
acids (Mikkelsen et al 2016a).
VitaminB12(togetherwithfolate)isinvolvedinthepreventionofchronicdiseases
associated with ageing through the methylation of homocysteine. This process has a
vital role in the prevention of amyloid and tau protein accumulation, which lead to
cognitive decline (Watson et al. 2018).


-----

70 B. Curko-Cofek [´]

An optimal vitamin B12 status does not depend only on adequate dietary intake,
and deficiency of the vitamin B12 is not rare. An effective absorption is crucial, but
it diminishes with age (Hughes et al. 2013). The absorption of food-bound B12 is
difficult because of the decline in gastric acid secretion and the lack of intrinsic factor
production in old age (Sawaengsri et al. 2016; Marsman et al. 2018). Deficiency leads
to megaloblastic anaemia, demyelinating neurological symptoms, irreversible nerve
damage and neuropathy (Sawaengsri et al. 2016). Furthermore, depression, mania,
psychosis, and suicidal behaviours can develop (Petridou et al. 2016).
The risk of low B12 levels in elderly is increased by use of proton pump inhibitors
and histamine H2 blockers. They inhibit gastric acid secretion (Maes et al. 2017) and
interfere with the release of B12 from binding protein, thus reducing the absorption of
vitaminB12(Wong 2015). Sincetype-2diabetes is frequent intheelderly, it shouldbe
kept in mind that Metformin (a medication used for the treatment of type-2 diabetes)
reduces serum B12 levels and could worsen diabetes-associated neuropathy (Out
et al. 2018).
Low vitamin B12 levels were found to increase blood pressure, contributing to
cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, a decrease in vitamin B12 concentration can
result in hyperhomocysteinemia, which could quadruplicate risk of stroke due to
atrial fibrillation in elderly patients (Spence 2017). A recent study (Ao et al. 2019)
reported that insufficiency of vitamin B12 and folate is a risk for decreased muscle
strength, which increases the risk of falling and fractures.
Subclinical deficiency of vitamin B12 seems to be implicated in the development
of several chronic age-related diseases. Evidence suggests that suboptimal levels of
B12 can raise homocysteine which is associated with the risk of bone fractures (van
Wijngaarden et al. 2013) and risk of cardiovascular diseases (Kehoe et al. 2019).
###### ***4.2.8 Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)***

Vitamin C is involved in biological functions as a potent antioxidant and radical
scavenger. It protects the cell against oxidative stress-mediated by reactive oxygen
species (ROS) and free radicals. Vitamin C is considered the most effective antioxidant in the plasma because of its water solubility and the wide range of ROS that it
can scavenge (Harrison 2012).
Since vitamin C acts as a cofactor of the monooxygenase and dioxygenase
enzymes, it is required for the synthesis of several crucial biomolecules (Morelli
et al. 2020). Vitamin C-dependent enzymatic reactions are involved in the biosynthesis of collagen and cellular procollagen secretion (Kehoe et al. 2019). Also, they
participate in the biosynthesis of L-carnitine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and other
molecules. Vitamin C improves the absorption of the non-heme iron, thus increasing
the bioavailability of iron (Sourabh et al. 2019).
The ability to transport ingested vitamin C from the intestines into the blood is
limited by the saturable sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter (SVCT1) in the
gut and thus very high intakes and the use of supplements are often erroneously


-----

4 Micronutrients in Ageing and Longevity 71

considered to be of greater benefit than they really are (Harrison 2012). It has been
reported that ageing, oxidative stress, and inflammatory factors cause changes in
the expression of SVCT 1 and SVCT2, transporters expressed in liver, brain, heart,
chondrocytes, and osteoblast (Patterson et al. 2021).
Experimental studies on animals and human pointed to the important role of
vitamin C in the synthesis, remodelling, and maintenance of the dermal extracellular
matrix. Environmental and intrinsic oxidative stress decreases the natural cutaneous

antioxidative mechanisms and induces pro-ageing signalling pathways and the accumulation of structural and functional changes, thus inducing intrinsic ageing and
photoageing. The hallmarks of ROS-induced skin ageing are wrinkle formation,
decreased resilience, pigmentation changes, telangiectasia, dehydration of the skin
(Crisan et al. 2015). Vitamin C, as a natural antioxidant, is effective in preventing and
treating skin ageing. It stimulates the barrier function of the endothelial cells, protects
keratinocytes from UV radiation, and shows photoprotective effects (Barbosa and
Kalaaji 2014). Topically applied vitamin C contributes to the maintenance of the
collagen quantity and density at the dermal level and is also involved in strengthening
the collagen fibres (Crisan et al. 2015).
Vitamin C is essential for wound healing. It decreases the expression of proinflammatory mediators and enhances the expression of various wound healing mediators. Leukocytes, which are the major players in wound healing, actively accumulate
vitamin C (Mohammed et al. 2016).
Severe vitamin C deficiency which leads to scurvy has become rare in most countries. Low levels of vitamin C are much more common. They have been associated
with high blood pressure, endothelial dysfunction, heart disease, atherosclerosis,
and stroke (Morelli et al. 2020). Long-term vitamin C deprivation, evidenced by low
plasma levels in men with normal diets, was linked to nervousness, depression, and
emotional lability (Harrison 2012). Furthermore, studies have shown that patients
with conditions, such as diabetes, COPD, chronic hypertension, and viral-induced
sepsis, have decreased levels of serum and plasma vitamin C (Patterson et al. 2021).
###### ***4.2.9 Vitamin D***

Vitamin D is a nutrient, a pro-hormone and steroid hormone with an important role in
calcium and bone metabolism. The biologically inactive form of vitamin D, vitamin
D3, can be obtained from dietary sources or dermal synthesis. D3 is converted in the
liver and kidneys to the active metabolite calcitriol (Hill et al. 2018).
Optimal vitamin D status is necessary for mineral homeostasis, bone health, and
function of skeletal muscles (Cianferotti et al. 2017). Vitamin D is important for
immune response because it stimulates phagocytosis by macrophages and protects
immune cells against apoptosis (Watson et al. 2018). As for the current Covid19 pandemic, some studies offer evidence that vitamin D status may influence the
severity of response to Covid-19 and that the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency


-----

72 B. Curko-Cofek [´]

in Europe coincides with Covid-19 mortality (Laird et al. 2020). Through its interactions with different types of cells, vitamin D may have several ways to reduce
the risk of acute respiratory tract infections and COVID-19: reducing the survival
and replication of viruses, reducing the risk of inflammatory cytokine production, increasing angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 concentrations, and maintaining
endothelial integrity (Mercola et al. 2020).
Vitamin D intake and absorption drastically decreases with age due to various
environmental and biological factors (Boucher 2012). Reduced sunlight exposure,
nutrient intake, fat absorption, and conversion to its active form (Watson et al. 2018)
contribute to more common and severe hypovitaminosis D in older people (Boucher
2012). It has been reported that over 90% of older adults in most European countries
have intakes below 10 μg/day, which is an average daily requirement for vitamin D
(Kehoe et al. 2019). Impaired mobility and residential care often limit sun exposure
and cause a decrease in the synthesis of vitamin D in the skin while a decline in renal
function reduces vitamin D activation (de Jongh et al. 2017).
Regardingtheageing,vitaminDdeficiencycanbeassociatedwithimpairedcognition, depression, cancer, and cardiovascular disease (Watson et al. 2018). For sure, the
most significant impact of deficiency is on bone metabolism. For people over 70 years
of age, the predominant bone health concerns are bone loss and the resulting osteoporotic fractures (Pfortmueller et al. 2014). Osteoporosis is a silent disease, and it
is responsible for about 9 million fractures annually worldwide (Johnell and Kanis
2006). A meta-analysis conducted by the National Osteoporosis Foundation found
thatcalciumplusvitaminDsupplementationresultedinastatisticallysignificant15%
reduced risk of total fractures and 30% reduced risk of hip fractures (Weaver et al.
2016). Supplementation may reduce the number of subsequent fractures, enhance
muscular strength, and improve balance (Childs et al. 2016).
When taking vitamin D supplements, it must be careful not to cause an excess
of the vitamin. Consequences of vitamin D overuse are acute kidney injury and
pancreatitis, secondary to hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria (Razzaque 2018).
###### ***4.2.10 Vitamin E (Alpha-Tocopherol)***

Vitamin E includes a group of eight structurally related antioxidants: four tocopherols
and four tocotrienols, each designated as α, β, γ and δ. Among them, α-tocopherol is
the most abundant and bioavailable antioxidant form of vitamin E in human tissues

(Rigotti 2007).
Vitamin E has an important function as an antioxidant, protects cells from oxidative stress caused by ROS (La Fata et al. 2014). ROS are mainly produced in mitochondria and represent important regulators of cell signalling. At high concentrations, they are harmful and cause cellular damage contributing to the ageing process
(Bratic and Larsson 2013). It is known that older adults, over 65 years of age, have


-----

4 Micronutrients in Ageing and Longevity 73

less effective enzymatic antioxidant defence and compromised immune and inflammatory responses. This result in an increased risk of infectious and non-infectious
chronic diseases in the elderly (Meydani et al. 2018).
The brain is highly susceptible to oxidative stress. For this reason, oxidative stress
which increases during ageing is considered a major contributor to neurodegeneration. It is involved in the onset of pathological conditions typical of old age, such as
Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. Vitamin E could help in these conditions since its
high plasma levels were repeatedly associated with better cognitive performance (La
Fata et al. 2014). Due to the lack of appropriate treatment for Alzheimer’s disease,
vitamin E, because of its relative safety and low cost, could be a nutritional compound
to promote healthy brain ageing and delay Alzheimer’s disease-related functional
decline (La Fata et al. 2014).
Vitamin E also has important non-antioxidant functions. The immunomodulatory
role of vitamin E includes lymphocyte proliferation, prostaglandin E2 production,
gene transcription, translation, cell membrane, and signal transduction (Zingg and
Azzi 2004). Therefore, some of the age-related dysregulations of the immune and
inflammatory responses have shown improvement due to vitamin E supplementation
(Wu and Meydani 2008).
###### **4.3 Minerals**

Minerals are essential nutrients divided into two major groups. Major or macrominerals (calcium, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and chloride) are
present in the body at levels greater than 0.01% and required in amounts greater
than 100 mg/day. Therefore, their function is both structural and regulatory. Trace or
micro-minerals (iron, cobalt, chromium, copper, fluoride, iodine, manganese, selenium, zinc, and molybdenum) are present in the body at levels less than 0.01% and
required in amounts less than 50 mg/day. Trace minerals have primarily regulatory
role in metabolic and immune functions (Celep et al. 2017).
Trace elements are involved in numerous important processes altered during
ageing, such as immune function, oxidative stress, insulin sensitivity, and cognitive function. These elements are vital to enzymatic activity, free radical scavenging,
modulationofoxidativedamage,DNArepaircapacity,andproteinfunctions(Meplan
2011). As with other nutrients, conditions that are common in the elderly, such as
malnutrition, interaction with medications, and reduced digestion and absorption, can
contribute to reduced intake of the trace elements. Low or inadequate intake of trace
elements can affect the ageing process and has been linked to disease development
in the older age (Roussel 2002).


-----

74 B. Curko-Cofek [´]
###### ***4.3.1 Copper***

Copper (Cu) is an essential trace element to human health because of its involvement
in a wide range of biological functions, especially in a central nervous system. It
is an integral component of various enzymes, such as cytochrome C oxidase, lysyl
oxidase, superoxide dismutase, dopamine β-oxidase, catalase (Zheng and Monnot
2012). Reduction in the Cu concentration affects the activity of these enzymes and
consequently decreases the capacity of the organism to reduce oxidative damage or
enhance repair capacity (Mocchegiani et al. 2014).
Copper deficiency has also been linked to the appearance of osteoporosis. Lysyl
oxidase is a copper-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the formation of aldehydes from
lysine residues in collagen and elastin precursors. In the case of lower Cu intake,
the reduction of lysyl oxidase activity occurs and leads to bone mass loss, called
osteopenia of copper deficiency (Arredondo et al. 2018).
As an unbound metal ion, Cu participates in the metabolism of neurotransmitters and nerve myelination (Zheng and Monnot 2012). Free Cu ions are present
in an organism in a very low concentration to prevent the possibility of inducing
highly reactive free radicals (Zoroddu et al. 2019). Due to its chemical reactivity,
both a deficiency and an excess of Cu can be detrimental to the central nervous
system (Zheng and Monnot 2012). An increase of the circulating Cu which is
not bound to ceruloplasmin can contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases in the ageing population, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s
disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, dementia with a vascular origin, spongiform
encephalitis(Creutzfeld-Jakobdisease),andHuntington’sdisease(Squittietal. 2014;
Cerpa et al. 2005). ***4.3.2 Iron***

Iron (Fe) is an essential trace element inevitable for many biological functions such as
oxygen transport, DNA synthesis, and mitochondrial oxidation ( Curko-Cofek et al. [´]
2017). Therefore, it has an important role during ageing maintaining the immune and
antioxidant function and cognitive abilities (Mocchegiani et al. 2012). However, iron
homeostatic mechanisms change during physiological ageing and create the basis
for iron deficiency or increased body iron stores (Fairweather-Tait et al. 2014).
Anaemia and iron deficiency are two of the most prevalent disorders worldwide.
According to the WHO, anaemia affects more than 25% of the population, while iron
deficiency is even more prevalent. Chronic inflammation has an important role in the
impairment of iron status (Dao and Meydani 2013) and its effects can be further
enhanced by malnutrition (Fairweather-Tait et al. 2014). Both, chronic inflammation
and malnutrition, are often present in the elderly, making this population susceptible to the development of iron deficiency. Iron deficiency in older adults has been
associated with a decline in physical performance, cognitive impairment, increased


-----

4 Micronutrients in Ageing and Longevity 75

susceptibility to falling and frailty, and mortality (Price et al. 2011). In contrast, iron
overload is mainly associated with pathological conditions, but it could also be relevant during ageing (Grubi´c Kezele and Curko-Cofek [´] 2020). In older adults, body
iron levels can be elevated due to consumption of iron supplements or vitamin C,
which enhances non-heme iron absorption (Fleming et al. 2002). Previous researches
associate high body iron with coronary heart disease (Hunnicutt et al. 2013), type 2
diabetes (Bao et al. 2012), and risk of cognitive impairment (Penke et al 2012).
During ageing, iron accumulates in different brain regions, creating an imbalance between ROS production and antioxidant defence. Oxidative damage caused
by the accumulation of iron in the brain increases the susceptibility of the aged
brain to disease and could be the reason why ageing is the major risk factor for
neurodegenerative diseases (Ashraf et al. 2018).
###### ***4.3.3 Magnesium***

Magnesium (Mg) has great physiological importance as a cofactor for numerous
biological processes. It participates in oxidative phosphorylation, energy production, protein synthesis, glycolysis, nucleic acid synthesis and stability (Dominguez
et al. 2021). Through its role in the active transport of ions across cell membranes,
Mg modulates neuron excitability, muscle contraction, and normal heart rhythm
(Barbagallo and Dominguez 2013). Furthermore, Mg is involved in immune response
participating in signalling pathways that regulate the development, homeostasis, and
activation of immune cells (Tam et al. 2003).
Total body Mg and Mg in the intracellular compartment tend to decrease with
age (Barbagallo et al. 2009). According to the published data, 73% of older men and
41% of older women in the Western world have inadequate Mg intake (ter Borg et al.
2015). Other frequent causes of Mg deficits in the elderly are reduced Mg intestinal
absorption and bone stores, and the excess urinary loss (Barbagallo et al. 2009). Low
Mg intake and low Mg body levels are associated with chronic conditions usual in
the elderly, such as high blood pressure, type-2 diabetes, osteoporosis (Marsman
et al. 2018), and low-grade chronic inflammation. This type of chronic inflammation
involves several tissues and organs, which are frequently associated with multiple
chronic diseases, and that has been named “inflammaging” (Franceschi and Campisi
2014). The fact that chronic Mg deficiency is frequent in old age (Barbagallo and
Dominguez 2013) could be significant in a time of COVID-19 pandemic. Namely,
Mg deficiency creates an appropriate microenvironment for the virus to promote
thromboembolism (Iotti et al 2020), the main feature of COVID-19.
In contrast, use of Mg supplementation reduces plasma C-reactive protein concentrations (Simental-Mendia et al 2017) and significantly lower blood pressure in those
with insulin resistance, prediabetes, and other chronic diseases (Dibaba et al 2017).
Also, it has been shown that Mg supplementation improves glucose metabolism and
insulin sensitivity in type-2 diabetes (Gommers et al 2016).

The consequences of Mg imbalance in the elderly may contribute to the ageing
process itself. Namely, Mg is required to maintain intracellular genomic stability, and
it is an essential cofactor in almost all enzymatic systems involved in DNA processing
(Hartwig 2001). DNA is continuously damaged either by environmental mutagens or
by endogenous processes. Mg has a significant role in removing DNA damage caused
by any of these causes (Barbagallo and Dominguez 2010). The data from research
(Killilea and Maier 2008) have shown that Mg deficiency may accelerate cellular
senescence in the cultured human fibroblasts with a loss of replicative capacity and
accelerated expression of senescence-associated biomarkers.
###### ***4.3.4 Zinc***

Zinc (Zn) is involved in many homeostatic mechanisms as a structural and regulatory catalyst ion for many enzymes, proteins, and signal transcription factors,
including cell proliferation, genome stability, and the immune system efficiency
(Cabrera 2015). The immune system is specially affected by the ageing process, and
therefore the term immunosenescence is often used in this context. Immunosenes
cence is characterized by a progressive abnormal regulation of immune responses,
both innate and adaptive. The result is low-grade inflammation, susceptibility to
infections (Alonso and De la Fuente 2011), and lower efficacy of vaccines (Lang et al
2011). There are remarkable similarities in the immunological changes during ageing
and Zn deficiency. In the case of Zn content decrease, immune cells show a decline
in function. There is a decrease in monocyte cytotoxicity, reduced phagocytosis in
neutrophils, increased apoptosis in B cells, deterioration of T cells functions, but also
an increase in autoreactivity (Ibs and Rink 2003). Zn deficiency shows the closest link
to ageing and immunosenescence through the oxidative inflammatory ageing (oxiinflamm-ageing) process. The oxi-inflamm-ageing theory associates oxidative stress
with ageing effects, particularly on the nervous, endocrine, and immune cells, which
have a regulatory systems function (De la Fuente and Miguel 2009). Zn deficiency
increases oxidative stress and causes the generation of inflammatory cytokines, such
as IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6 and TNF-α (Cabrera 2015). Together, immunosenescence and
inflamm-ageing contribute to most of the diseases of the elderly, such as infections,
cancer, autoimmune disorders, and chronic inflammatory diseases. However, recent
data suggest that these two processes are not only detrimental but also adaptive and
remodelling, and therefore may be needed for extended survival/longevity (Fulop
et al 2018). Since many studies confirm a decline of Zn levels with age, bearing in
mind the important role of Zn in immunity, oral Zn supplementation has the potential to improve immunity and downregulate chronic inflammatory responses in the
elderly (Haase and Rink 2009).

4 Micronutrients in Ageing and Longevity 77
###### ***4.3.5 Selenium***

Selenium (Se) is a trace element essential for human health. However, the safe range
of exposure to Se is generally narrow, and both Se deficiency and excess can be
harmful to human health (Garcia-Esquinas et al 2021). Se is an essential component of several major metabolic pathways, including thyroid hormone metabolism,
antioxidant defence systems, and immune function. The biological functions of Se
are exerted by selenoproteins in which Se is incorporated in the form of the amino
acid selenocysteine (Kryukov et al 2003). Selenoproteins have antioxidant effects and
are involved in regulating antioxidant activities. Reactive oxygen species are initial
factors in ageing and ageing-related diseases. Therefore, Se alleviates ROS-mediated
processes, such as inflammation or DNA damage (Cai et al 2019). Skeletal muscle is
one of the major sites of Se storage (30–45% of the total pool), and several selenoproteins are involved in muscular function. Other potential health benefits of Se status in
older populations are reduced risk of immune dysfunction, cognitive decline, cardiovascular disease, certain tumours, and overall mortality (Garcia-Esquinas et al 2021).
However, there are still many contradictions regarding the role of Se in longevity
and ageing-related diseases, as well as about Se supplementation. In the case of Se
excess, Se is non-specifically incorporated into proteins other than selenoproteins,
changing protein structures and thereby affecting their function (Cai et al 2019). **4.4 Conclusion**

Micronutrients are vital for human health, especially in the ageing process. They
support the function of immune, nervous, and cardiovascular system, protect cells
from oxidative stress and enable call division, reduce cognitive decline. The best
way for the elderly to maintain the quality of life and prevent disease is a healthy
diet and a healthy lifestyle. Diet should be rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains,
and lean proteins and within micronutrients DRI values recommended by IOM.
However, many factors in the older population influence dietary intake and cause
undernutrition. In that case, oral supplements are needed but should be used with
caution. Potential drug-nutrient interaction and excess intake should be avoided.
Therefore, the best way is to adjust the intake to the actual needs of the organism
determined by nutrition assessment.

##### **Chapter 5**
#### **Probiotics and Prebiotics in Healthy** **Ageing**

**Aayushi Kadam, Deepak Kadam, Kanchanlata Tungare, and Heena Shah**

**Abstract** Probiotics and prebiotics have been reported to be useful in maintaining
health and ameliorating various disease conditions. This chapter provides insights
into the beneficial role of various probiotics and prebiotics along with their probable mechanisms of action. Several pieces of evidence from clinical trials and *in-*
*vitro* studies have been presented and discussed in this chapter specifically in relation to ageing, longevity and general well-being of an individual. Probiotics have
been reported to significantly enhance the skin elasticity, moisture content and gloss
with a reduction in wrinkle depth which are all aging related consequences. These
biotics increase antioxidants levels with decreased hair loss, skin ulcers and agerelated inflammation. It promotes the number of mitochondria in cell and extends
the lifespan. Also, they display a beneficial role in the prevention of abdominal pain,
diarrhoea, diabetes mellitus, infant colic, irritable bowel syndrome, *C. difficile* infection and ulcerative colitis. On the other hand, prebiotics is known for elevating
the antioxidant enzyme levels thereby minimizing harmful reactive radicals and
increase immuno-regulatory cytokines which may further impart double protection
when given with the right combination of probiotics. The results from several studies
reflectthepotentialofthesebioticsinvarioustherapeuticinterventions,albeititisalso
recommended to the researcher’s community to plan and execute active surveillance
to understand other side effects associated with the usage of these biotics.

###### **5.1 Introduction**

The microbiome comprises trillions of bacteria, viruses, and fungi in/on our body
(Brody 2020; Wang et al. 2017). The microbes found in the cecum of our large
intestine are referred to as the gut microbiome (Davani-Davari et al. 2019). This gut
microbiome is home to over 100 trillion good micro-organisms that include 1000
species and more than 9000 strain of each species. The gut is also considered as the
largest immune organ in the human body and a vital part of the endogenous host
defense system. It is the home of more than 80% of the antibody-producing cells
which is a little brain within the human body. Many of the gut microbiomes are
distinct pathogenic and beneficial bacterial species (Brody 2020). This gut microbiota imparts many benefits to the host, through various physiological functions such
as strengthening of gut integrity or shaping of the intestinal epithelium (Natividad
and Verdu 2013; Thursby and Juge 2017), harvesting energy (den Besten et al. 2013;
Thursby and Juge 2017), protecting against pathogens (Bäumler and Sperandio 2016;
Thursby and Juge 2017), modulating the metabolic phenotype, regulating epithelial
development (Wang et al. 2017), and influencing innate immunity (Gensollen et al.
2016; Thursby and Juge 2017; Wang et al. 2017). The gut microbiota starts colonizing right from birth and keeps on altering till the end of life. The modulation of
gut microbiota from time to time depends upon the ages, sexes, races, diets of the
host, illness, antibiotic treatments, environment, individual genetics, stress, hygiene
sanitation practice followed, etc. (Arrieta et al. 2014; Thursby and Juge 2017; Wang
et al. 2017).
Symbiotic relation of human and normal gut microbiota positively metabolizes
non-digestible compounds, supplies essential nutrients, maintains energy homeostasis, prevents the colonization by opportunistic pathogens, and contributes to
the formation of intestinal architecture enriching the long healthy lifespan (Round
and Mazmanian 2009). These non-digestible foods are primarily dietary fibers such
as cellulose and hemicellulose, which are commonly found in vegetables and can
be digested by a specific species of *Bacteroides* (Larsbrink et al. 2014). Other nondigestible soluble fibers, for example fructooligosaccharides and galactooligosaccharides are utilized by beneficial microbes, such as *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium*
(Goh and Klaenhammer 2015). As an end product, this gut microbiota produces
short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetic acids, propionic acids, and butyric
acids (Duncan et al. 2009). These SCFAs are used as an energy source to the host
intestinal epithelium, as well as are absorbed in the colon to serve various roles in
regulating gut motility, inflammation, glucose homeostasis, and energy harvesting
(Cani et al. 2013). Studies have been done to show the role of the gut microbiota in
lipid and protein homeostasis, microbial synthesis of essential nutrients and vitamins
such as folates, vitamin K, biotin, riboflavin (B2), cobalamin (B12), and possibly
other B vitamins (Morowitz et al. 2011). Moreover, this gut-microbiota encourages
the normal development of the humoral, cellular mucosal, innate immune systems
of the host (Cebra 1999; Thaiss et al. 2016). Also gut microbiota leads to the normal
development of gut-associated lymphoid tissue and antibody production (Round and


-----

Mazmanian 2009) and inhibits the dendritic cells mediated T-helper cell (Th17)
anti-inflammatory pathway (Magrone and Jirillo 2013).
However, with the modern lifestyle, there are changes in food habits, lack of
physical activity and excess stress which has led to the fluctuations in the population
of gut microbiota that culminates in various immune-mediated diseases. Moreover
many life events experienced at an early age disrupt the microbiota which may result
in the development of diseases later in life (Arrieta et al. 2014; Penders et al. 2007).
Too much of gut bacteria will ferment more fiber into excess fatty acids which
may get deposited in the liver and lead to “metabolic syndrome” that often leads to
various conditions such as type 2 diabetes, heart diseases, and obesity. Reduction
in the population count of anti-inflammatory gut bacteria may lead to inflammatory
bowel diseases, including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. On the contrary,
when the population of inflammatory bacteria increases it may cause rheumatoid
arthritis. Disorders of the CNS example—anxiety, depression, and autism spectrum
disorder are also linked by the ecosystem of gut bacteria. Dysbiosis, i.e., imbalances
in the ecosystem of gut bacteria may be the reason for the condition of colon cancer,
chronic fatigue syndrome, etc. (Menees and Chey 2018; Nagy-Szakal et al. 2017).
In this chapter, we will discuss the various probiotic strains and prebiotics (nondigestible fibers) and their mechanisms of action as well as their health benefits
specifically in relevance to aging and longevity. Various risks and safety-related
issues related to the use of these biotics will also be discussed.
###### **5.2 Probiotics**

A healthy individual has 10 times more the number of gut microbiota in comparison to the number of cells present in the body. Four dominant phyla i.e. *Firmicutes,*
*Bacteridetes, Proteobacteria* and *Actinobacteria* encompass different organisms of
different genus and species. The phyla of *Firmicutes* include all organisms belonging
to the genus *Lactobacilli*, *Staphylococcus* and *Clostridium* whereas *Proteobacteria*
encompasses most of the pathogen like *Enterobacteria*, *Salmonella*, *Escherichia* and
*Shigella* (Stojanov et al. 2020).The phylum called *Actinobacteria* includes *Bifidobac-*
*teria* . Many of these microbiotas are strategically associated with the gut epithelial
lining called Gut Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT) which further serves as a
habitatfor70%ofallimmunologicalactivecellsandalsoremainsinconstantcommunication with other immunologically active cells of the intestine (Belkaid and Hand
2014; Jandhyala et al. 2015).
There are specific probiotic strains known to display enhanced functionality,
specifically *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacteria* and hence popularly called psychobiotics for their potential therapeutic benefits (Sarkar et al. 2016). A vast majority of
probiotic bacteria belongs to the genus *Bifidobacteria* or *Lactobacilli* and within
the genus, many bacterial species display different probiotic activities with a difference in the rate of survival and response. *Lactobacillus* are very popularly used as
probiotics and are part of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) family that converts hexose


-----

sugars to lactic acid in the intestine thereby producing an acidic environment which
inhibits the growth of several harmful bacterial species (Fayol-Messaoudi et al. 2005;
Florou-Paneri et al. 2013). Further LAB family includes *Lactobacillus*, *Lactococcus*,
*Enterococcus*, *Oenococcus*, *Pediococcus*, *Streptococcus* and *Leuconostoc* species
and several other strains of the *Bifidobacterium* that are known for their resistive
mechanisms to bile salts (Fijan 2014; Ruiz et al. 2013). Similarly a strain called
*L. acidophilus* is resistant to bile acid and possess strong antimicrobial effect on
other intestinal pathogens including fecal *E. coli* strains (Plaza-Diaz et al. 2019).
*L. acidophilus* mainly ferments the non-digestible carbohydrate (include galactose,
mannose, trehalose, saccharose and esculin), convert it into organic acids (lactic
acid and acetic acid) and produce antibiotic substances (Lactocidin, Acidophilin,
Acidolin, Lactocin B) (Nagpal et al. 2012). All these organisms together impart
probiotic effect and influence the physiology of the individual.
###### ***5.2.1 Role of Probiotics in Aging, Longevity and Well Being***

The microbiota and their metabolites in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) system
play a critical role in modulating gut-associated immune systems (Magrone and
Jirillo 2013). There is a need for anti-aging and stress-reducing probiotics in all age
groups. Particularly, in the elderly population due to gradual deterioration of their
anatomyandphysiologicalfunctionsthatleadstoanimbalanceintheirgutmicrobiota
ecosystem. This change in microbial composition mainly contributes to metabolic
and inflammatory diseases such as irritable bowel disease, diabetes, cardiovascular
disease, celiac diseases, food allergies, rheumatoid arthritis and colorectal cancer
(Geier et al. 2006; Nagpal et al. 2018).
Moreover, the aging gut also contributes to the over-expression of proinflammatory cytokine IL-6, which significantly affects the function of the intestinal barrier
and mucosal immune system (Nagpal et al. 2018). Further decrease in mucus secretion by these healthy bacteria causes changes in intestinal permeability which leads
to the development of celiac disease, colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease
and even systemic as well as CNS disorders (Kho and Lal 2018). However, a healthy
lifestyle with a customized nutritional diet including probiotics can protect against
several age-related chronic diseases in elderly people (Landete et al. 2017).
The majority of probiotics inhabited in GIT are anaerobic and their mutualistic
behavior possesses wild ranging metabolic activity in the maintenance of physiological functions, including intestinal homeostasis, digestion of complex carbohydrates,
protection against pathogens, synthesis of essential nutrients and vitamins, and stimulation of the immune system (Gorbach 1996; Judkins et al. 2020). For example, many
probiotics in the lower intestine tract ferment wide a variety of dietary fibers in food
to produce SCFAsandother metabolites including acetate, propionate and butyrate
that have a distinct role in promoting gut health. SCFA is also involved in controlling
anorexigenic hormones by signaling to the gut via free fatty acid receptors (Lu et al.
2018). Acetate is mainly metabolized by the peripheral tissues and propionate is


-----

gluconeogenic. Butyrate is the major energy source for the colonic epithelium that
is significantly reduced in elderly people (Parada Venegas et al. 2019). The species
called *F. Prausnitzii* and *Roseburia* notably involves in butyryl CoA: acetate CoA
transferase route for butyrate formation (Shinohara et al. 2019). Moreover, butyrate
can be generated from the LAB family in the colon from the lactate as a precursor.
For example, *Bifidobacterium* species in combination with *A. hadrus* and *Eubacteri-*
*umhallii* form butyrate in the host colon that confers several health benefits (Rivière
et al. 2016). Studies also reveal that the supplementation of probiotics in the elderly
population, with or without specific diet composition can improve the functionality
of microbiota (Landete et al. 2017). In addition to this, a diet rich in phytoestrogens
has benefited the aging population since they are pro-estrogenic and antioxidant in
nature (Rietjens et al. 2017).
Lactobacillus species like *L. acidophilus*, *L. fermentum*, *L. reuteri* and *B. Bifidum*
have been reported to up-regulate transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) along with down-regulation
of interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in
older patients with Parkinson’s disease when supplemented for 12 weeks (Borzabadi
et al. 2018). Probiotics supplementation has also been beneficial in older patients
with osteoporosis. Treatment with Kefir fermented milk constituting *Leuconostoc*
and *Lactobacillus* for 6 months was found to increase bone formation with elevated

bone mineral density at the femoral neck and hip region (de Oliveira Leite et al.
2013; Tu et al. 2015). Further reports have suggested that probiotics can modulate
serum hs-CRP levels, pain symptoms and may improve quality of life in patients with
a history of knee osteoarthritis (Lei et al. 2017). Also in the same context, *L. casei*
strain resulted in minimized pain and early recovery in wrist flexion and grip strength
of elderly patients with distal radius fracture (Lei et al. 2016). Reports also point out
the beneficial aspect of probiotics in relieving constipation issues. Bifidobacteria in
yogurt has been reported to improve stool frequency (Tanaka and Shimosaka 1982).
A commercially available *L. rhamnosus* LC705 and *Propionobacter freundreichii*
mixture have been investigated to increase in defecation frequency of elderly subjects
by 24% (Ouwehand et al. 2002). On the other hand, *B. subtitlis* which is an active
ingredient of “natto” is proposed to be contributing to the long and healthy longevity
of the Japanese population. At recommended doses *B. subtilis* in human food may
decrease the rate of aging and stamp out disease because of the downregulation of
insulin/IGF-1 signaling with enhancement of innate immunity (Ayala et al. 2017).
More studies on various anti-aging properties of probiotics are represented in Table
5.1.

The probiotics in the gut ecosystem promise two major benefits that include
immunomodulatory activity that alleviate many age-related pathologies as well as
the formation of bioactive metabolites from dietary compounds (Hemarajata and
Versalovic 2013). The immune and protective functions of the microbiota are mediated by different mechanisms. One of them is competition with the pathogen in the
lumen and by enhancing the mucosal barrier (Bron et al. 2017; Plaza-Diaz et al.
2019). Microbiota stimulates the epithelium to secrete mucin and strengthen their
tight junctions between cells (Takiishi et al. 2017). There are micro-organisms that

classes of micro-organisms modulates the cellular immune response in the gut by
stimulating both Th1 and Th2 cell types (Yan and Polk 2011).

the effect of the brain on the gut microbiome can be found in studies documenting
that parental, early-life and psychological stress changes the composition of the
gut microbiota (Mohajeri et al. 2018). On the other hand, GIT physiology depends
on the function of the gut including its motility, its sensation, diet, microbiota and
immunefunction. Functionof GITmicrobiotaprimarilyproves beneficial indigestion
and metabolic activities. Many of these bacteria synthesize vitamins along with the
fermentation of non-digestible carbohydrates that reduce the pH of the gut and also
metabolize carcinogens (Gorbach 1996; Judkins et al. 2020; Rowland 2000).
Furthermore, immune development, modulation and enhancement of gut barrier
function are major components of gut microbiota. *Bifidobacterialactis* (strain Bp-12)
was the first bacteria to achieve GRAS status from the US-FDA for use in infants
from birth. The use of this *B. lactis* as oral probiotics by infants has a decade of
safety record (Pham et al. 2017). There have been systematic reviews and clinical
trials showing a group of babies growing adequately without having any severe side
effects and considered safe by regulatory agencies (Sanders et al. 2010). There are
reports on babies who have colic also expresses dysbiosis. Populations of children
with colic are reported to harbor less *Lactobacilli* or have less diversity of bacteria in
their gut ecosystem than babies who do not have colic. This unhealthy ecosystem has
more coliform bacteria like *E. coli* which leads to an increase in gut inflammatory
markers (Pham et al. 2017). Many reports explain the relationship between these
symptoms of crying in colic and an abnormal gut ecosystem. Supplementation of *L.*
*reuteri* increases the amount of *Lactobacilli* in the stools of babies and decrease of the

presence of *E. coli* in the gut thereby improving the symptom of infantile colic along
with the reduced frequency of functional regurgitation (Chau et al. 2015; Garofoli
et al. 2014; Indrio et al. 2015; Savino et al. 2010). Also, *L. reuteri* supplementation
significantly decreased the episodes and duration of diarrhea along with decreased
respiratory tract infection in children compare with placebo (Gutierrez-Castrellon
et al. 2014).
###### ***5.2.2 Incorporating Probiotics into Foods***

The incorporation of probiotics in foods has decades of history and is added into
several dairy and fermented foods to improve their structural and sensorial functionality. Although the techniques have matured over a period of time but their mechanism of action remains the same. These probiotics can be incorporated in fresh,
refrigerated dairy products and a broader range of supplementation as an ingredient.
However, the selection of compatible probiotic strain and incorporating into foods
and most importantly keeping them alive throughout shelf life is a challenge for food
biotechnologists. Besides fermented food products, one has to ensure that the food
matrix will support probiotic growth. Furthermore, it is also necessary to ensure that
the safety of incorporated probiotics does not adversely impact health as well as taste
and texture of food during new product development.


-----

5 Probiotics and Prebiotics in Healthy Ageing 93

These probiotic ingredients in food mainly are selected from *Lactobacillus* and
*Bifidobacterium* genus due to their predominant inhabitance in human GI microbiota.
A wild range of species in this genus has been used in food supplementation. Notably,
some strains of those species have exhibited healthy probiotic attributes. For example,
strain like *Bifidobacterium infantis, B. adolescentis, B. animalis subsp animalis, B.*
*animalis subsp lactis, B. bifidum, B. longum, B. Breve* etc. are demonstrated to be
effective probiotics in literature (O’Callaghan and van Sinderen 2016).
Phytoestrogens such as coumestans, ellagitannins, lignans, and isoflavones are
similar to endogenous estrogen and have both anti-estrogenic and estrogenic effects.
They are present in plants or foods derived from plants such as soya, cereals, vegetables, fruit etc. Phytoestrogens protect against various age-related chronic diseases
such as cardiovascular and bone diseases, cancers, and cognitive function (Landete
et al. 2017). These health benefits derived from phytoestrogens consumption are
attributed to bioactive metabolites generated by gut bacteria (Bolca et al. 2013).
Thus, the intake of a diet rich in isoflavones, lignans and ellagitannins in combination with selected probiotic bacteria may lead to the production of equol, enterolignans, and urolithins in the gut, respectively (Gaya et al. 2017; Romo-Vaquero et al.
2015; Shimada et al. 2010). This combination of bioactive-rich food with probiotics
should be looked upon in amelioration, mitigation and prevention of aging-related
pathologies. Nowadays, different bacteria such as *Butyribacterium methylotroph-*
*icum*, *Eubacterium callanderi*, and *Peptostreptococcus productus* and the strains
*Eubacterium limosum*, *Ruminococcus productus*, *Clostridium scindens*, *Peptostrep-*
*tococcusproductus* SECO-Mt75m3,and *Eggerthellalenta* SECO-Mt75m2havebeen
involved are being used in the production of enterolignans which further protect from
age-related diseases (Landeteetal 2017). Albeit direct anti-aging probiotic formulations are still to be explored, extensive research is being conducted to fortify various
food products with probiotics that influence the health status, nutritional levels and
well-being of a consumer.
*Bifidobacteriumanimalis* subsp. *lactis* which are included in LAB family are also
used in the fermentation of milk due to their proteolytic activity. These probiotics are
included in the dairy product for enhancing the sensorial property along with their
proteolytic activity. Besides *Bifidobacterium* strain also induces immunoglobulin
production that improved the nutritional value of food by assimilation of substrates
not metabolized by the host (Maldonado Galdeano et al. 2019). Thus these probiotics with different functionality are used in combination to yield better results. For
example *Lactobacillus delbrueckii* ssp and *Bulgaricus species* are used in combination for acid formation and the production of aroma substances such as acetaldehyde
are popular (Chen et al. 2017). Similarly, for the production of yogurt optimum
combination of *L. acidophilus*, *Bifidobacterium lactis* and *S. thermophiles* are used.
The strain *S. thermophiles* also show a symbiotic relationship with *L. bulgaricus* in
the yoghurt production. During yogurt production, there is increase in the acidity of
the media and oxygen consumption which is favorable for the growth of *L. bulgaricus*
that further forms valine, an essential growth component for *S. thermophilus* . In addition, these strains are also used in various starter cultures to produce fermented dairy
products and cheese. Strain *L. casei* is also used to enhance the sensorial property


-----

94 A. Kadam et al.

of traditional dairy products such as kefir and cheese (Horiuchi and Sasaki 2012).
Studies have also shown the use of *L. rhamnosus* GG strain in dairy probiotic products marketed for infant formulations. This strain is indigenous to human intestinal
flora and thus it has resistance to low pH values with superior adherence ability to
the gastrointestinal tract. Another genus called *Enterococcus* are also present in a
higher amount in dairy products and have been demonstrated to exhibit widespread
technological properties owing to the production ability of bacteriocin (Banwo et al.
2013). Studies have also shown effective use of *E. faecium and L. gasseri* in diarrhea treatment and thus can serve as a possible alternative to the usage of antibiotics
(Margreiter et al. 2006). As a probiotic, *E. faecium* have been used for reducing the
absorption of cholesterol from the digestive system whereas *L. gasseri’s* probiotic
activity is attributed to its reducing fecal mutagenic enzyme (Kumar et al. 2012).
###### **5.3 Prebiotics**

In 1995, Gibson and Roberfroid defined prebiotics as “a non-digestible food ingredient that provides beneficial effects to host by selectively stimulating the growth
and/or activity of one or a limited number of bacteria in the colon” (Carlson et al.
2018). In other words, prebiotics is food source which remains undigested by
host enzymes, but in the large intestine these are used by microbiota for nourishment. These substances should be selectively used by the host microorganisms and
fermented by one or a few colonic bacteria that are beneficial. Also, it has to confer
a health benefit which is a critical part because the health benefit has to be measurable and therefore confirmable. For example, a prebiotic called fructooligosaccharide (FOS) is used as a growth substrate for bifidobacteria and some other colonic
bacteria as well (Rossi et al. 2005). FOS has been shown to improve calcium absorption, therefore has measurable health benefits (Whisner and Castillo 2018). Similarly, other carbohydrates with low digestibility are also being tested for health
benefits which include mono-oligosaccharide (MOS), pectooligosaccharide (POS),
galactooligosaccharide (GOS), and xylooligosaccharide (XOS) (Belorkar and Gupta
2016). Several other prebiotics such as inulin, oligofructose, lactulose, human milk
oligosaccharide, arabinoxylan, resistant starch, polyphenol, etc. are being studied for
their modes of action and health benefit s . Recently clinical trial has been conducted
using arabinoxylan oligosaccharide (AXOS) as an oral supplementation that reveals
the increased total bacterial populations and fecal butyrate concentrations (Sanchez
et al. 2009). The natural food sources of the prebiotics are wheat, onions, bananas,
honey, garlic, berries, legumes, beans, peas, oats, jerusalem artichokes, asparagus,
dandelion, apple skin, chicory root, and leeks. In contrast to fibers, such as cellulose,
pectins, and xylans, which promote the growth of many microorganisms in the gut,


-----

5 Probiotics and Prebiotics in Healthy Ageing 95

prebiotics such as fructooligosaccharides and galactooligosaccharides mainly stimulate the proliferation of *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium* (“Probiotics and Prebiotics | World Gastroenterology Organisation” 2018; Quigley 2019). Fructooligosaccharides are one of the most common prebiotics, whereas other non-digestible carbohydrates like non-starch polysaccharides, plant wall polysaccharides, and pectins, are
not necessarily prebiotic agents, but are termed as dietary fibers. Thus all prebiotics
are not fiber and all fibers are not prebiotics. The only thing common in both prebiotics and fibers is that both cannot be digested in the human small intestine and are
fermented by the gut microbiota (Floch 2014).
###### ***5.3.1 Mechanism of Prebiotic Action***

Understanding the mechanism of prebiotic action is very critical as probiotic bacteria
use this prebiotics for their growth by fermenting them and releasing other metabolites as by-products. There are different routes for product formation which involve
bacterial cross-feeding where the intermediate products are substrates for other
bacteria (Blaak et al. 2020).
Production of SCFA by gut microorganisms from prebiotics and other substrates
facilitatesdirectutilizationoftheseprebioticsorcomplexcarbohydratesthatgenerate
butyrate or propionate as beneficial SCFA. Further degradation of these complex
compounds by short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria or non-fermentative
microorganisms can yield a different product. For example, Bifidobacteria can
produceintermediateproductssuchaslactateoreventheshort-chainfattyacidacetate
that are then used by gut bacteria (Blaak et al. 2020). Moreover the antioxidant action
of inulin-type fructans on colon mucosa and contractility is also reported. Inulin,
through SCFA, can act as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and appears
to resist cooking or digestion. Inulin can modulate responses to pathogenic bacterial
lipopolysaccharide and protect the gut from inflammatory processes. This mode of
inulin action is probably a defense mechanism against ROS by up-regulating colonic
mucosal detoxification enzymes like glutathione S transferase thereby restoring the
level of some important proteins involved in intestinal smooth muscle contraction (Guarino et al. 2020). However, the exact mechanisms by which inulin acts
on intestinal muscle functions to exert direct and/or indirect response to colonic
mucosa are not well understood. The various *in-vitro* effects of inulin-type prebiotics
are documented not only to stimulate the antioxidant enzymes and scavenge reactive radicals but also to prevent lipid peroxidation in the stomach, replace vitamin
C as dietary supplements and inhibit degradation of ascorbate (Busserolles et al.
2003; Kanner and Lapidot 2001; Miene et al. 2011; Phillips et al. 1995). β-GOS
is also reported to exhibit immune-modulating function by increasing the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10, with a significant reduction of IL-1β expression levels
(Vulevic et al. 2015). GOS mixture is documented to increase the blood level of
interleukin 8 (IL-8) and C-reactive protein and to improve Natural Killer (NK) cell
activity as well (Vulevic et al. 2015). Another report indicates that supplementation


-----

96 A. Kadam et al.

with GOS in mice improved lipid metabolism with significant enrichment of mouse
microbiota (Cheng et al. 2018). LBA also has anti-inflammatory properties, and in a
study on mice, it was demonstrated that its administration is associated with control of
obesity and associated metabolic parameters. Lactulose on the other hand is reported
to increase *Bifidobacterium* count (Bouhnik et al. 2004), but not Lactobacilli with
low production of SCFAs. 5 g/day dose extends the correct balance among the microbial population and SCFAs production, while 10 g/day decreases butyrate production
and increases acetate content (Bothe et al. 2017). XOS and soybean oligosaccharides
increases the population of *Bifidobacteria*, *Lactobacilli*, butyrate fecal concentration
and inhibit clostridium growth (Lecerf et al. 2012; Lin et al. 2016; Mäkeläinen et al.
2010). Polyphenols are also known to increase the growth of *Lactobacilli*, *Bifidobac-*
*terium*, *F. Prausnitzii* and reduce *Clostridium* growth (Okubo et al. 1992; Tzounis
et al. 2011). It also inhibits pro-inflammatory mediators cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2),
IL-6, TNF-α, Nuclear Factor kB (NFkB) and Vascular-Endothelial Growth Factor.
Polyphenols have also been reported to reduce serum triacylglycerol and C- reactive
protein (Guarino et al. 2020). Thus dietary intake of prebiotics seems to have a positive modulatory effect on intestinal microbiota by not only promoting the growth
of good intestinal bacteria, but also by producing metabolites that are potentially
protective of gut functionality.
###### ***5.3.2 The Health Benefits of Prebiotics***

The health benefits of prebiotics need to be validated in controlled studies on the
target subjects. This beneficial effect(s) are mainly categorized into local effects (gut
targeted) or systemic effects (whole-body). There are three immediate local effects
that prebiotics can have. First, prebiotics like dietary fiber contribute to fecal bulking
and also increased transit rate through the colon that protecting the gut or the colonic
epithelial cells from any toxic compounds that might have been ingested in the diet.
Increased transit rate make sure that any such toxins move through the large intestine
more quickly again protecting the gut cells. Second, bacterial fermentation of the
prebiotic causes a lowering of the pH. This helps to inhibit the growth of pathogenic
bacteria which donot generally grow in an acidic pH. Moreover it also improves
calcium solubility and therefore uptake of calcium and influences bone health (Slavin
2013). SCFAs like butyrate, acetate and propionate are important energy sources for
the gut epithelial cells which keep the gut healthy and help gut cell turnover (Parada
Venegas et al. 2019). So these local effects have very specific health benefits. Furthermore, the European food safety authority (EFSA) has also given a positive opinion
for the consumption of Native chicory inulin that increase stool frequency (Micka
et al. 2017). Probiotics like GOS and FOS supplementation in infant formula reveals
the increase in Bifidobacteria number (Vandenplas et al. 2014). Also, consumption of FOS and inulin resulted in increased in calcium absorption that improved
bone health in adolescents and menopausal women (Whisner and Castillo 2018).
The systemic effects of prebiotic fermentation by the gut microorganism have been


-----

5 Probiotics and Prebiotics in Healthy Ageing 97

studied during clinical trials and have revealed metabolic and immunomodulatory
functions (Hemarajata and Versalovic 2013). The effects are accomplished through
fermentation by the gut bacteria and then through uptake of metabolites or interaction
with the host. Food ingredients particularly diet as prebiotics are fermented by the
gut microbiota into the SCFA that is used as an energy source by the epithelial cells.
SCFAenterstheliverthroughthebloodstreamwheremostofitgetsinvolvedingluconeogenesis (den Besten et al. 2013). Moreover, this SCFA also reaches other organs
like brain, muscle and adipose tissue. SCFA may stimulate a particular effect through
interaction with receptors present in these organs. For example G-protein-coupled
receptors (GPR41/43) present in epithelial cells interact with SCFA and lead to the
secretion of hormones PYY and GLP-1 which then reach the brain and lead to satiety
(Koh et al. 2016). Similarly in adipose and muscle tissue SCFA lowers inflammation
(Vinolo et al. 2011). A randomized double-blind trial suggests a fiber-containing
yogurt sweetened with lactitol as a natural means of treating chronic constipation in
elderly hospitalized subjects (Rajala et al. 1988). GOS relieves constipation in few
but not all elderly people by ensuring an easy defecation process (Teuri and Korpela
1998). They suggested different people have different responses upon GOS ingestion.
Another trial to investigate the repercussion of lactose or inulin on the bowel habits of
constipated elderly patients revealed that inulin served as a better laxative effect than
lactose and reduced functional constipation with mild discomfort (Kleessen et al.
1997). Furthermore, the consumption of oral supplementation with FOS and inulin
for 12–13 weeks is reported to improve physical function, nutritional status, quality
of life, as well as frailty degree (Jayanama and Theou 2020). Inulin with vitamin D is
also reported to increase physical function, nutritional status and quality of life in a
multicentric prospective observational study (Abizanda et al. 2015). Inulin with FOS
enhanced handgrip strength and modulated Barthel index, body mass index along
with frailty phenotype (Kleessen et al. 1997; Theou et al. 2019). The beneficial effect
of GOS in increasing *Bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus* with decrease in
pathogenic organisms is also well established (Vulevic et al. 2015). This article also
reports increased IL-10 levels with a decrease in IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α post GOS
ingestion in a double-blind, cross-over, randomized controlled trial.
###### **5.4 Risk and Safety Issues**

Although probiotics have been used safely over a period of hundred years in the food
and dairy industry, the safety outcomes have not yet been effectively reported during
clinical trials. According to Marteau 2001, “the zero risk does not exist, and that
acceptance of the concept that probiotics may not only have positive effects but potentially also side effects is important.” A report by the Agency for Healthcare Research
and Quality (AHRQ) on the safety of probiotics extended comprehensive literature on
622 organisms from 6 genera viz., *Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Lactobacillus,*
*Streptococcus, Enterobacillus and Bacillus* but did not provide conclusive evidence
of risk and rather insinuated that the literature is not sufficiently equipped to claim the


-----

98 A. Kadam et al.

safety nature of the probiotics with assurance (Hempel et al. 2011). Clinical trials in
hospitalized children, hospitalized adults and immunocompromised subjects using
various strains have revealed no toxic effects. Likewise, trials conducted in pregnant
women, premature neonates, elderly people and patients with inflammatory bowel
disease also showed no harmful repercussion of the probiotics (Doron and Snydman
2015). A report by World’s Health Organisation (WHO) in 2002 suggested that
probiotics may have four types of typical side effects like a) Systemic infections b)
Excessive immune stimulation, c) detrimental metabolic activities and d) Transfer
of genes FAO/WHO (2002). There exists a plethora of literature suggesting the side
effects of the probiotic strains such as *S. boulardii, L. rhamnosus, B. subtilis, S.*
*pyogenes, K. pneumonia, L. acidophilus, B. infantis, S. thermophilus, L. bulgar-*
*icus* during clinical trial. Some reports have revealed the occurrence of systemic
infections caused by *S. boulardii* in subjects receiving treatment against fungemia
and have reported complication such as fever spike, septic shock, contamination of
central venous catheter, massive colonization by yeast and transmission of infection
(Cesaro et al. 2000; Hennequin et al. 2000; Lherm et al. 2002; Muñoz et al. 2005;
Perapoch et al. 2000). Munoz et al. 2005 have recommended that probiotics can
prove to be critical specifically in immunosuppressed patients. A child with the short
gut syndrome and a young man were reported with an incidence of bacteremia and
endocarditis along with septic arthritis respectively owing to treatment with *L. rham-*
*nosus* (De Groote et al. 2005; Presterl et al. 2001) *.* On the other hand, nosocomial
bacteremia and distinct septicemic episodes were recorded in subjects given with oral
preparation of *B. Subtilis* (Oggioni et al. 1998; Richard et al. 1988). The organism
caused severe immunodeficiency and persisted in the intestinal tract of 73 years old
male with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Oggioni et al. 1998). *Lactobacilli* strain
was also reported to cause a systemic infection like bacteremia by Land et al. 2005.
In other reports, *S. pyogenes*, *L. rhamnosus, K. pneumonia* and other bacterial probiotic cocktail caused immunostimulation in monocytes, monocytes derived
immature dendritic cells and bone marrow derived dendritic cells. *L. rhamnosus*

caused moderate increase in the expression of cell-surface co-stimulatory molecules
andchemokineresponse, whereas, *S. pyogenes* stronglyinducedmaturationof monocyte derived dendritic cells (Veckman et al. 2004). *K. pneumoniae* induced Th1
immune responses via dendritic cells and differential response to various bacterial strains exist owing to differential modulation of dendritic cells (Braat et al.
2004). Probiotic cocktail was reported to modulate dendritic cell surface phenotype
and cytokine release in granulocyte–macrophage (Drakes et al. 2004). A provoked
D-lactic acidosis case was reported in a Chinese boy with short bowel syndrome
upon probiotic ( *L. acidophilus* and *B. infantis* ) supplemention (KU et al. 2006).
Furthermore, 61 pediatric patients when supplemented with *L. rhamnosus*, the zilch
effect was observed in reducing the incidence of nosocomial infections and instead
promoted the infection (Honeycutt et al. 2007). *L. acidophilus*, *B. lactis*, *S. ther-*
*mophilus* and *L.bulgaricus* with oligofructose favorably altered the microbial composition of the upper gastrointestinal tract but had no effect on intestinal permeability
(Jain et al. 2004).

5 Probiotics and Prebiotics in Healthy Ageing 99

Lactic acid bacteria possess plasmids containing genes conferring resistance to
various antibiotics suchas tetracycline, erythromycin, macrolide, chloramphenicol or
lincosamide streptomycin, and streptogrammin. There are some reports that pediococcus and leuconostoc species can accept broad host range antibiotic resistance
plasmids from lactococcus species. Conjugation transfer from enterococci to lactobacilli and lactococci can occur in the gut of animals as well as in vitro; however, the
transfer to lactobacilli is quite rare (Doron and Snydman 2015). Lateral gene transfer
between probiotic organisms to other organisms in the gut or other sites is possible
though no clinical evidence of transfer of antimicrobial resistance has ever has been
reported. This is particularly important to investigate as probiotics arecommonly used
to rejuvenate the good microflora of gut post/during antibiotic treatment. Furthermore application of mono-strains or multi-strains need to be evaluated carefully for
their synergistic modulatory role.
On the other hand, prebiotics are known to cause significant change in the gut
microbiota composition, treat chronic constipation and facilitate easy defecation in
elderlypeople. Prebiotics posse’s better laxativepotential andcanimprovenutritional
status, physical function and quality of life of elderly subjects. Prebiotics are also
reported to improve stool quality (pH, frequency and consistency) in children as well
(Bozzi Cionci et al. 2018). It also reduced the risk of gastroenteritis and improves the
general well-being of a person. Not many reports are available with respect to effect
of prebiotics in elderly aged groups and thus more studies need to be undertaken for
component characterization, functional characterization, product formulation and
safety assessment using double blind, randomised-controlled human clinical trials.
###### **5.5 Research Trends, Research Gaps and Future** **Perspective**

Classical probiotics have shown promising effects on human gut microflora but
there is always an urge to develop better strains followed by the improved selection process. Previous studies have lead to the possible next-generation probiotic
strains like *Clostridium* clusters IV, XIVa and XVIII, *F. prausnitzii*, *Akkermansia-*
*muciniphila, Bacteroidesuniformis*, *Bacteroidesfragilis* and *Eubacteriumhallii* . The
next-generation probiotics were evaluated in preclinical trials and yielded positive
outcomes of possessing modulatory roles in inflammatory and metabolic disorders.
Extensive clinical trials can give information on the effective use of these next
generation microbes in mono-strains or multi-strains based formulations against
many age-related diseases. In addition, new techniques are required for the development of new probiotic products containing strains of human origin (El Hage et al.
2017). Other than next-generation microbes, postbiotics and paraprobiotics are the
upcoming horizons in the field. Postbiotics and paraprobiotics are cell constituents,
metabolic by-products and non-viable microbial cells, respectively that contribute
in health improvement (Nataraj et al. 2020). They are made from many probiotic


-----

100 A. Kadam et al.

strains and postbiotics by different inactivating methods. Various postbiotics include
metabolic by products of living probiotic organisms such as vitamins, cell free supernatants, bio-surfactants, phenols (urolithins, equol, enterolactone, valerolactones,
8-prenylnaringenin and enterodiol) flavonoids (norathyriol, daidzein, desaminotyrosine, equoldaidzein), terpenoids (paeoniflorin, genipin, paeonimetabolin I, II, III
and paeoni lactone glycosides) (Cortés-Martín et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2019). On
the other hand, parabiotic include ruptured components of probiotic cells such as
teichoic acids, muropeptides, pili, fimbriae, flagella, exopolysaccaride etc. (Chung
et al. 2019; Shenderov 2013).
The use of such molecules in therapeutic studies provides an upper edge in understanding the molecular mechanisms of each purified cell component as using probiotics may yield confusing outcomes owing to complex bacterial structure. They
havebeenlinkedtoharborimmunomodulatory,anti-inflammatory,anti-hypertensive,
hypocholesterolemic, anti-obesogenic, anti-proliferative, and antioxidant activities
(Vallejo-Cordoba et al. 2020). Postbiotic preparations have also received patents as
1) anti-tumour agents, 2) bio-therapeutics for immunomodulation specific claims and
feed additives for monogastric animals (Nataraj et al. 2020). These reports suggest
the excellent potential of these molecules to boost host health by mitigation and
prevention of the diseased condition. But their mechanism of action and elated signal
transduction pathways are still unexplored and may be extensively researched by
using of metatranscriptomic, metabolomic and metaproteomic approaches that may
contribute in understanding their mechanism of action. Further their potential applications in the pharmaceutical and food industry can be revealed. Also, advancement
in modern techniques and methods can lead to the production of bioengineered novel
recombinant probiotics (Vallejo-Cordoba et al. 2020). More number of clinical trials
authenticating the claims of these bioactive molecules may prove their direct therapeutic implications. Trials on subjects with low immune competence can unfold
the tolerance status of these bioactive molecules by immunocompromised subjects.
Stability related studies of para and postbiotics in in vitro and in vivo digestive
conditions can prove beneficial in further exploring their health benefits.
Therearestillsomeimportantunansweredquestionsrelatedtoprobioticsthatneed
the urgent attention from researchers such as scientific validation of all claimed benefits by the definition of probiotics? There are very meagre reported meta-analyses,
systematic reviews in comparison to the clinical trials conducted which reflects the
inadequate comparison of these trials. Predominantly, the efficacy of probiotics is
investigated widely in gastrointestinal diseases like antibiotic associated diarrhea,
*Clostridium difficile* diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease and necrotizing enterocolitis. Also, another major area of research is probiotic induced allergy and atopy.
Despite of so much research, there are issues with understanding the efficacy of
probiotics due to poor quality clinical trials, abysmal clinical trial reports and sufficiently evaluated safety reports. Moreover, Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality (2011) report complained about the inadequate literature to substantiate
whether probiotics consumptions are safe, but still probiotics are being consumed
by millions of people on daily basis further raising the concern.

###### **5.6 Conclusion**

Aging leads to several pathologies that may be directly or indirectly be associated
with the imbalances of the gut microbiota and associated immune system. Moreover,
intestine is considered to be the prime organ to enhance and improve the quality of
life in age-related senescence process. These beneficial organisms residing in the gut
may impart a powerful ameliorative effect in the prevention of age-associated health
deterioration by its immunomodulatory activity. Reduction in proinflammatory status
and age-related pathologies can be mitigated by adopting a healthy lifestyle along
with a customized diet for elderly people. Probiotics possess excellent potential in
preserving the integrity of the gut barrier and in evading infection. Prebiotics rich diet
can facilitate the probiotics to exhibit their important function and may lead to the
generation of equol, enterolignans, and urolithins, which are considered protective
against chronic diseases related to aging. Although investigating the toxicological/
safety aspect of probiotic and prebiotic is a pressing priority, their applications in
treatment, prevention and amelioration of the diseases seem to be gaining popularity and have been reported to be beneficial by many researchers. The limited
data expressed in the risk and safety section should not dishearten the investigator
to promote the usage of good bacteria in different food products. Moreover, it is
recommended to the researcher community to plan and execute active surveillance
to understand infections and other side effects associated with the usage of these
biotics. Also, it is important to investigate whether the probiotic usage is appropriate in subjects with low immune competence, short bowel syndrome, cardiac
valve disease and central venous catheters.

###### **6.1 Introduction**

Hormetins are the conditions—physical, chemical, biological and psychological—
which can bring about health beneficial effects by inducing stress responses in a
living system (Rattan 2017). Exercise is the most well-known example as a physical hormetin, which initially induces the production of free radicals, acids and cell
distortions, but eventually leads to numerous health benefits (Pingitore et al. 2015). S. I. S. Rattan ( B )

This phenomenon of stress-induced potential health benefits is known as physiological hormesis (Calabrese et al. 2007, Rattan and Le Bourg 2014, Rattan and Kyriazis
2019).
Nutritional hormetins are the natural compounds present in the food, which actually induce stress, but can elicit a range of biological effects, such as antioxidative,
anti-inflammatory, prebiotic, antibiotic, and metabolic regulatory effects. Almost all
spices, herbs and various other so-called medicinal plants come under this category of
being nutritional hormetins, without providing any significant amounts of the usual
nutritional components—proteins, carbohydrates and lipids. This article aims to give
a brief overview of the phenomenon, principles and mechanisms of hormesis, and
to discuss some examples of natural and synthetic nutritional hormetins, especially
with respect to their effects on health, ageing and longevity.
###### **6.2 Hormesis and Its Molecular Basis**

Hormesis is the non-linear stress response often described using various terms
addressing the shape of the dose–response curve as biphasic, bimodal, bitonic,
U-shaped, inverted-U-shaped, J-shaped, nonmonotonic, functional antagonism and
stimulatory inhibitory curve (Calabrese and Baldwin 2001b). Furthermore, terms
such as adaptive response, preconditioning, autoprotection, heteroprotection, and
paradoxical effects have also been used to describe the nature of the biological dose response patterns (Calabrese and Baldwin 2001a). However, the term
hormesis, which was coined originally in 1943 (Southam and Ehrlich 1943), has
now been widely adopted as a result of a collective article written by more than 50
leading researchers from a variety of disciplines, including biomedical gerontology
(Calabrese et al. 2007). Further refinements of the term hormesis were also made in
that article, such as conditioning hormesis, post-exposure conditioning hormesis and
physiological hormesis, dealing with specific aspects of the biological consequences
of stress.

The key conceptual features of hormesis are the disruption of homeostasis, the
modest overcompensation during counter-action, the reestablishment of homeodynamics and the adaptive nature of the process (Rattan and Le Bourg 2014, Rattan
and Kyriazis 2019). The ultimate consequences of stress can be both harmful and
beneficial depending both on the intensity, duration and frequency of the stress, and
on the physiological price paid in terms of energy utilisation and other metabolic
disturbances. But the most important aspect of stress response is that it is not monotonic with respect to the dose of the stressor, and is almost always characterized by
a nonlinear biphasic relationship (Calabrese and Mattson 2017). Another frequent
observation in studies of hormesis is that a single hormetic agent can improve the
overall physiological characteristics such as enhanced immunity, improved cognition, and increased tolerance to other stresses, in a holistic process of biological
amplification of health beneficial effects (Rattan 2008).

Physiological hormesis is the phenomenon in which low doses of a stressor, which
is generally toxic at high doses, could be beneficial for the system. The terms “stressor” and “stress” are defined as any physical, chemical or biological factors that
disrupt the homeostasis of a biological system and initiate a series of events in order
to counteract, adapt and survive (Rattan 2008, Giudice et al. 2018). This intrinsic
and dynamic ability of all living systems to respond, to counteract and to adapt to
the external and internal sources of disturbance is known as homeodynamic space
(Rattan 2020a). A wide range of molecular, cellular and physiological pathways are
the basis of this homeodynamic ability, and these range from multiple pathways
of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA repair to free radical counteracting mechanisms,
proteinturnoverandrepair,detoxificationmechanisms,andotherprocessesincluding
immune- and stress-responses (Rattan 2019). All these processes involve numerous
genes whose products and their interactions give rise to a “homeodynamic space” or
the “buffering capacity”, which is the ultimate determinant of an individual’s chance
and ability to survive and maintain a healthy state (Rattan 2020a).
A critical component of the homeodynamic space of living systems is the capacity
to respond to stress, which also provides the molecular basis to the phenomenon
of hormesis. Table 6.1 gives a list of the main molecular stress responses (SR),
some examples of commons stressors, and various immediate and late molecular
sensors and effectors, which are integral to the organismic property of homeodynamics and the phenomenon of hormesis (Bhattacharya and Rattan 2019, Calabrese
and Kozumbo 2021).
Each of these SR pathways is well understood in terms of its molecular biology,
and several excellent review articles can be found in the published literature and
online sources. Briefly, and as discussed in detail previously (Bhattacharya and
Rattan 2019), autophagy response is the lysosome-mediated and chaperone-mediated
sequestering of damaged membranes and organelles, which is a SR induced during
nutritional limitation, starvation, and hypoxia (Ryter and Choi 2013, Filomeni et al.
2015). Heat shock response (HSR) is a universal and primordial stress response to
protein denaturation, achieved by the activation of the HS transcription factors, and
followed by the preferential synthesis of several heat shock proteins (HSP) (Verbeke
et al. 2001, Ciocca and Caderwood 2005, Leak 2014). Similarly, accumulation of
misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) leads to the so-called ER
stress response, also known as the unfolded protein response (UPR), resulting in the
synthesis, activation and translocation of several chaperones (Lee 2001, Lin et al.
2007, Yoshida 2007, Banhegyi et al. 2007). Other primary SR include hypoxiainduced SR via hypoxia-inducible factor, DNA damage response involving several
DNA repair genes, inflammatory response by the activation of NFkB, and energy
and nutritional deficiency SR involving AMPK, mTOR, sirtuins and the deacetylation of histones and other proteins in response to reduced levels of metabolic energy
(Bhattacharya and Rattan 2019).
In the context of nutritional hormetins, a widely studied pathway through which
cells respond to oxidative stress is the Nrf2-mediated regulation of transcription of
antioxidant genes (Calabrese and Kozumbo 2021). The main regulator of this specific
antioxidant phenotype is the transcription factor Nrf2 which regulates the basal and

inducible expression of numerous detoxifying and antioxidant genes (Motohashi
and Yamamoto 2004, Singh et al. 2010). Under normal conditions, Nrf2 is held in
the cytoplasm by the specific inhibitory protein Keap1. Oxidative modification of
cysteine residues of KEAP1 induces conformational changes and a loss of Nrf-2
binding, allowing Nrf2 to translocate to the nucleus where it heterodimerizes with
specific co-factors, and leads to the transcription of various genes through the regulatory regions of antioxidant response elements (AREs). Some of the genes activated by
stress-induced activation of Nrf2 are heme oxygenas-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H-quinone
oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1), and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) (Bhattacharya and
Rattan 2019).
Although there may be some overlap, generally the initial induction of SR is quite
stressor-specific. The specificity of the response is mostly determined by the nature
of the initial damage induced by the stressor and the variety of downstream effectors involved (Bhattacharya and Rattan 2019). For example, cytoplasmic induction
of protein denaturation by heat, heavy metals and antibiotics will initiate HSR by
inducing the synthesis of HSP followed by the activation of proteasome-mediated
protein degradation. But, unfolded proteins in the ER will induce UPR, and will
initiate the induction of synthesis of a totally different set of proteins and their

downstream effectors. Similarly, whereas oxidative damage to proteins will generally initiate Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response, damage to DNA by free radicals or
other agents will result in the activation of DNA repair enzymes. In the same vein,
whereas nutritional deprivation and low energy levels will activate autophagy and
FOXO-sirtuin pathways, infections and antigenic challenge will generally initiate
pro-inflammatory NF *κ* B response (Bhattacharya and Rattan 2019).
However, often the source (stressor) of activation of SR cannot be easily identified,
and may involve more than one stressor and their effectors. Examples of such SR
include early inflammatory SR and neuroendocrinal SR, which lead to the synthesis
and release of interleukins and corticoid hormones, respectively. Similarly, pathways
involving NF- *κ* B, Nrf2, FOXO, sirtuins and heme-oxygenase (HO) activation may
involve more than one type of stressors and stress signals, including pro-oxidants, free
radicals, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and nutritional components (Bhattacharya
and Rattan 2019). Following the initial activation of one or more primary SR, higher
order (cellular, organ level and body level) responses are manifested, which include
apoptosis, inflammation, and hyper-adrenocorticism etc. (Giudice et al. 2018).
Therefore, although the exact nature of the initial molecular damage caused by
a compound may not be easily identified, activation of one or more primary SR
pathways is a good indicator of the potential nature of a compound as a hormetin.
###### **6.3 Hormetins in Food**

Nutritional hormetins are the hormesis-inducing chemicals present in the food, which
bring about any health beneficial effects by initially causing stress (damage) in a
biphasic dose response. As discussed in the earlier section, damage-induced activation of one or multiple pathways of SR can lead to potentially health beneficial effects
by removing, repairing or adapting to the causative damages. Often the biological end
point, such as anti-oxidative effects observed after exposure to a food component, is
mistakenly interpreted as if the original chemical compound was an anti-oxidant. In
reality, however, such compounds are not direct anti-oxidants, but are hormetins (Ali
and Rattan 2006, Rattan 2017), which are sometimes also referred to as adaptogens
(Wiegant et al. 2009, Panossian et al. 2021) or indirect anti-oxidants (Gutteridge and
Halliwell 2010, Sadowska-Bartosz and Bartosz 2014)}. Various dietary components
present in spices, herbs, and numerous medicinal plants, and some vitamins, trace
elements, minerals and others are actually hormetins (Franco et al. 2019).
As an example of a prevalent misinterpretation of the biochemical nature of a
compound as being antioxidant is the induction of Nrf2-mediated oxidative SR
which leads to antioxidative biological effects (Calabrese and Kozumbo 2021). Activation of Nrf2 transcription factor follows the electrophilic modification/damage of
its inhibitor protein Keap1, which then leads to the accumulation, heterodimerization, nuclear translocation and DNA binding of Nrf2 at the antioxidant response
element (Balstad et al. 2011). This binding results in the downstream expression
of a large number of the so-called anti-oxidant genes, such as haeme-oxygenease-1

(HO-1), superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and catalase, giving rise to a biologically
antioxidative result. Some well-known phytochemicals, which strongly induce Nrf2mediated SR, include curcumin, quercetin, genistein and eugenol and food extracts,
such as coffee, turmeric, rosemary, broccoli, thyme, clove and oregano (Balstad
et al. 2011, Lima et al. 2011, Calabrese and Kozumbo 2021. In other cases, such
as alpha lipoic acid and coenzyme Q10, it is their pro-oxidant activity in producing
hydrogenperoxide,whichinducesdefensiveresponses{Linnane,2007#6132).Similarly, certain mimetics of superoxide dismutase also appear to work through hormetic
pathways by inducing oxidative SR (Melov et al. 2000, Bayne and Sohal 2002, Keany
et al. 2004). None of these compounds should be called as anti-oxidants.
Another SR pathway, which has been studied in detail, and can be the basis for
identifying nutritional hormetins is the HSR. Induction of proteotoxic stress, such
as protein misfolding and denaturation initiate HSR, leads to the activation of the
processes of protein repair, refolding, and selective degradation of abnormal proteins
cleaning up the debris and an overall improvement in the structure and function of
the cells (Verbeke et al. 2001, Ciocca and Caderwood 2005, Leak 2014). Various
phytochemicals and nutritional components have been shown to induce HSR and
have health beneficial effects. These potential hormetins include phenolic acids,
polyphenols, flavonoids, ferulic acid, geranylgeranyl, rosmarinic acid, kinetin, zinc
and the extracts of tea, dark chocolate, saffron and spinach (Ambra et al. 2004, Son
et al. 2008, Berge et al. 2008, Barone et al. 2009, Sonneborn 2010, Wieten et al.
2010).
Components of various medicinal plants used frequently in the traditional Chinese
medicine (TCM) and in the Indian Ayurvedic system of medicine appear to be
achieved through hormetic pathways. For example, celastrols and paeoniflorin
present in some medicinal herbs used in TCM, have cytoprotective effects and induce
HSP in human cells (Westerheide et al. 2004, Yan et al. 2004). Other pathways of SR,
which are involved in initiating hormetic effects of nutritional components are the
NFkB, FOXO, sirtuins, DNA repair response and autophagy pathways. Resveratrol
and some other mimetics of calorie restriction work by the induction of one or more
of these SR pathways (Longo 2009, Sonneborn 2010).
With respect to ageing and longevity, Table 6.2 provides some examples of the
purified chemical entities from various food sources, which have shown stressinduced health beneficial hormetic effects. Most of these studies have used isolated
active compounds and tested them individually for their effects on survival, ageing
and lifespan, using experimental model systems, such as the fruitfly *Drosophila,*
the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans,* rodents rats and mice, and human cells in
culture. Some extension of lifespan and healthspan, along with slowing down of the
emergence of various ageing markers, is a common feature of all such studies, some
of which are cited in the Table 6.2. What makes these food components qualify as
nutritional hormetins is the fact that all these purified compounds from food sources
induce one or more SR described in the earlier section.

As regards the chemical nature of these nutritional hormetins affecting ageing,
lifespan and healthspan, the major chemical categories of identified so far are
polyphenols, flavonoids, and terpenoids. Additionally, vitamins, minerals, trace

elements, and modified bases of nucleic acids are other chemical categories of
nutritional hormetins in the context of ageing and longevity (Table 6.2).
Although the exact nature of the initial molecular damage caused by such
hormetins may not be easily identified, an activation of one or more SR is a good
indicator of the immediate and primary action of the compound. However, induction
of a specific SR pathway as the first response (immediate response) does not rule
out the induction of one or more other SR pathways later on (delayed response). A
complete and successful SR for effective homeodynamics and for the maintenance of
the homeodynamic space includes both immediate and delayed SR. Furthermore, as
argued previously (Demirovic and Rattan 2013), it is important that all SR pathways
are analysed simultaneously and a complete stress response profile is established
under a given condition, such as age-, health- and disease status, and during and after
exposure to single or multiple hormetins. Being able to map the kinetics and amplitude of different SR, and their effects on each other, can form the basis to evaluate
the health status of an individual and to develop effective means of aging modulators
and maintainers of homeodynamic space.
###### **6.4 Hormetins as Nutrition, Food and Diet**

It seems that non-nutritional foods (in the sense that they do not provide any significant amounts of proteins, carbohydrates and fats) have always been an integral
component of the dietary habits of human beings. Such food categories include
mainly spices, herbs and other plants claimed to have various medicinal and other


-----

6 Nutritional Hormetins in Ageing and Longevity 117

beneficial properties, and enhance the flavor and taste of the food. Different cultural
practices have given rise to a fascinatingly wide variety of food preparation and
consumption methods, along with various health-associated claims. But there is no
universally agreed notion of the best food for health and longevity. The mythology
of food and the cultural practices are full of stories and claims, which may or may
not be scientifically verified *(see the chapter by Ilias Stambler in this book).*
Modern scientific analyses of numerous food sources and non-food sources have
identified individual active molecules which account for their specific biological
effects. Such discoveries have also led to the successful development of some very
effective drugs, such as aspirin, atropine, digoxin, colchicine, morphine, quinine and
many others used in therapy against many diseases. Nutritional hormetins are a novel
category of “drugs for health”, which can stimulate body’s intrinsic abilities for maintenance, repair, tolerance and adaptation towards strengthening its homeodynamic
space and survival (Rattan 2017).
In practice, nutritional hormetins in food are already being used for thousands
of years in the dietary patterns of different societies with different food cultures
and habits; and there are numerous folk-remedies and recommendations based on
their experiences (Gerber et al. 1999, Rahman 2003). There are also epidemiological data showing the correlation between certain food habits and the occurrence of
various diseases in different populations (Martucci et al. 2017, Chopan and Littenberg 2017). However, modern scientific research, generally by using experimental
model systems, has identified the active compounds in some of those foods, and
has provided mechanistic explanations and information about the concentrations of
those compounds required to gain health benefits.
An important issue to emerge from such studies is that, owing to the serious issues
of low bio-availability of active compounds in vivo, it is almost impossible to achieve
those relatively high doses from normal dietary composition and consumption of
food. That is why there is a great incentive to develop and market single- or multiplehormetin products in the form of nutraceuticals, cosmeceuticals and food supplement
products (Rattan et al. 2013). Unfortunately, in the absence of any rigorous tests
performed on human beings, these commercial products are often based on naïve
extrapolations from model organisms, anecdotal evidence, overhyped claims and
false promises (Rattan 2020b).
###### **6.5 Challenges and Unresolved Issues**

We now understand that several things that we eat as food in our diet, and which are
considered to be generally health beneficial, are actually damage-causing stressors,
termed as nutritional hormetins. Plants generally produce them as toxic metabolites
for self-defense (Pallauf et al. 2016, Butt et al. 2018). It is basically with trial-anderror over long periods of cultural practices that humans have developed various
methods of cooking, mixing and preserving for safe consumption of such toxins

approaches have opened up the possibilities of identifying and using the most active
chemicals in these hormetins in the form of nutritional supplements, functional foods
and nutraceuticals.

However, several important issues remain to be resolved in order to develop
nutritional hormetin-based health care product and recommendations.

1. Determining the interactive and pleiotropic effects of multiple hormetins. This is
because hormetins in diet are almost always consumed as a part and combination
of the original food sources, such as curcumin in turmeric, capsaicin in chilli
peppers, rosemarinic acid in rosemary, resveratrol in grapes or wine and so on
where numerous other chemicals are also present.
2. Establishing the regimens for the consumption of hormetins in terms of the
quantities, timing and frequency.
3. Adjusting the levels of hormetins to account for age-related and general healthrelated changes in the sensitivity to stress-inducing compounds.

Finally, it may be useful to recount that not all components of the food are good
or bad in a simple and straight forward manner. Unlike the proteins, carbohydrates
and fats as the major macromolecules necessary for cell structure and physiological
functions, numerous other chemicals and small molecules have a paradoxical nature.
This applies especially to the plant metabolites which are generally toxic and offputting for most animals, but we humans have discovered and invented ways of using
those food sources safely. Nutritional hormetins are an integral part of the nutrition,
food and diets all around the world with its cultural variations and myths.

##### **Chapter 7**
#### **Notes Toward an Evolutionary Biology** **of Nutrition**

**Donovan P. German and Michael R. Rose**

**Abstract** One of the most important foci for adaptation among animal species is
their consumption, digestion, and utilization of food. Despite this centrality, the topic
has not been a major focus for evolutionary biology, with a few salient exceptions.
Here we raise fundamental evolutionary questions involving the biology of animal
nutrition.

The most important limitation on the evolutionary biology of nutrition is the
problem of specialization. No animal is entirely omnivorous. Instead, all animal
species specialize on the consumption of a finite range of foods. This central limitation is then more subtly modulated by a series of secondary constraints that we
delineate here: (i) long-term evolutionary history of prior nutritional adaptations; (ii)
ecological fluctuations producing rapid changes in the favored features of nutritional
adaptation; (iii) problems of reduced population size and inbreeding degrading nutritional adaptation; and (iv) falling forces of natural selection with adult age, which
limit the degree to which later-life features effective adaptation to current diets.
We apply these evolutionary considerations to three different contexts for research
that are affected by the evolutionary biology of nutrition. (1) Laboratory research
with recently caught wild animals, or their immediate descendants. Such research has
revealed something of the profound diversity of animal adaptations to the predicaments of nutrition. (2) Laboratory research using long-cultured model organisms.
This type of experimentation inherently involves a spectrum of basic evolutionary
issues, because long-cultured organisms inevitably undergo laboratory evolution.
(3) Clinical and related research on human nutrition and its associated health consequences. This is the case of greatest medical interest, but it too is entangled with
profound evolutionary considerations, such as interactions between our evolutionary
history and the range of alternative foods that humans now consume.
Overall, we believe that our discussion raises deep evolutionary issues that have
been neglected too often in scientific studies of nutrition ranging from animal
husbandry to experimental physiology to the epidemiology of human chronic disease.

###### **7.1 Introduction**

All animals must eat in order to survive, leaving aside the rare animals that have
photosynthetic commensals. But the evolution of adaptations that enable animals to
live off diverse nutrients is a subject that has too often been neglected, outside of the
optimal foraging literature (MacArthur and Pianka 1966; Pyke 1984) and the few
species cultured for human consumption (e.g., Van Soest 1994).
It needs to be said at the outset that there are frequently problems with the use
of evolutionary reasoning by scientists or physicians who did not receive extensive training in the field of evolutionary biology. Evolution by natural selection is
a powerful force. It has produced extensive diversity among the animals of our
planet, and no doubt still greater diversity across all the planets that have animal
species. But that evident power often blinds those who aren’t evolutionary biologists
to the profound limitations on what evolution by natural selection can achieve. And
such blindness has been a long-standing problem with respect to thinking about the
evolutionary biology of nutrition.
Let’s begin with a hypothetical Omnivorous Darwinian Beast that can devour any
kindofsubstratethatcontainsnutrients.Ineffect,ifthereisfuelthatcangeneratecalories in a bomb-calorimetry assay, then that Omnivorous Darwinian Beast (“ODB”)
can extract a large proportion of those calories. Furthermore, assume that the ODB
can synthesize all of the proteins, lipids, and other hydrocarbons required for its
metabolism from a minimal diet that contains water, a carbon source, a nitrogen
source, and trace minerals, from sulfur to iron. That is to say, this ODB has no need
of “vitamins” and faces no limitation with respect to the kinds of nutrients it can use
as catabolic or anabolic fuel.

The nutrition of such an ODB would be of relatively little evolutionary interest. It
can eat anything and thereby survive, reproduce, and live in excellent health, leaving
aside infectious disease, predators, parasites, and the general scourge of aging. Its
diet is not of particular interest from the standpoint of evolutionary thinking.
But that is not the way actual animal species ever evolve. Evolving species of
animals face a long list of evolutionary constraints and contexts which preclude
achieving such an ODB, and this is true of any organism from bacteria to animals to
plants (Allison et al. 2014). Here we provide a sketch of some of the more important
evolutionary constraints that would prevent such perfect omnivory. Then we continue
with three important applications of our evolutionary reasoning: (i) the appropriate
design and interpretation of nutritional experiments with laboratory animals; (ii)
the design and interpretation of nutritional experiments with recently caught wild
animals; and (iii) the appropriate invocation of evolutionary reasoning in discussions
of optimal human nutrition.

7 Notes Toward an Evolutionary Biology of Nutrition 125
###### **7.2 The Core Problem: Specialization**

The core problem for the evolutionary biology of animal nutrition is the heterogeneity
of potential foods. Nutrition can be derived from microbial organisms, such as the
commensalbacteriatobefoundinmanyanimalguts,orfromenvironmentalmicrobes
(e.g., detritus), which is common in terrestrial and aquatic systems; fermented human
foods would represent an extension of this mode of feeding. Nutrition can be obtained
from plant matter, or it can be obtained from the tissues of other animals. In rare
cases, important nutrients can be obtained from mineral sources, such as rock salts.
Within each of these broad categories, the mechanical properties of the sources
of nutrition vary widely. Some microbes and mineral sources may provide nutrients
that can be directly absorbed through gut walls. But many microbial species have cell
wallsmadeofpeptidoglycanorchitinthatrequirecatalyticormechanicaldestruction,
before the nutrients that they contain can be absorbed. Plant tissues vary from soft,
in the case of some fruit, to hardened, such as bark and the shells of nuts. The
latter often require the application of considerable mechanical force, fostering the
evolution of mandibles of some type and even manual destruction by animals with
limbs. The efficiency with which animals digest foods declines with the amount
of refractory material (e.g., fiber; Karasov and Douglas 2013) present in the food
(Fig. 7.1). Animals that are used for food require discovery, capture, subjugation, and
devouring. The adaptations that their predators have evolved to achieve those ends
are endlessly diverse, as are the adaptations that such prey have evolved to evade
their destruction. The natural history of acquiring and consuming prey is vast.
Even when nutritional material is in the gut of an animal, further adaptations are
required to extract nutrients from the gut contents, including the detoxification of
noxious substances present in the food. Large proteins must be broken down into
oligopeptides, dipeptides, and amino acids that can be absorbed. Fats must be broken
down into fatty acids and their glycerol or phosphate backbones that a particular
animal can absorb. Simple sugars, like those in nectar, can usually be absorbed

**Fig. 7.1** As a general rule, utilization efficiency of a food, whether on the scale of energy, or
nutrients absorbed, declines with increasing amount of refractory material in food. Refractory
material usually refers to plant insoluble fiber (e.g., cellulose), but can also refer to anything that
dilutes or makes soluble nutrients more inaccessible to digestive enzymes in the gut. After Karasov
and Douglas (2013)

directly, but sugar polymers like starch and cellulose require specific enzymes to be
broken down into their absorbable, monomeric units.
The diversity of foods needing to be digested has resulted in a range of digestive system morphologies and functions (Fig. 7.2). Some animals require the aid of
microbestobreakdownpolymers(e.g.,cellulose),ordetoxifysecondarycompounds,
and they do this by providing habitat within the alimentary canal (Moran et al. 2019)
(orotherbodycavities,likethegills;Waterburyetal. 1983;Altamiaetal. 2020)where
microbes can establish and flourish within that system. Some animals do this in the
foregut (e.g., ruminants, hoatzin), others do that in the hindgut (e.g., rats, termites).
Some animals have acidic stomachs, like most mammals, reptiles, and about 75% of
fish species, where hydrochloric acid aids in the initial digestive process, usually of
protein, but thousands of taxa lack this specialization. All animals have some absorptive tissue, which is usually in a tubular form, like an intestine (Stevens and Hume
1995). A tube gives the highest surface area for absorption within a body cavity

**Fig. 7.2** Basic design of a gut. Most animals have some form of an intestine, but vary as to
whether they possess other compartments such as crop, forestomach, stomach, caecum, and large
intestine/colon. As a general rule, catalytic enzymatic reactions occur in the intestine, whereas
microbial fermentation can occur in the forestomach, caecum, and large intestine/colon (shown
with stippled areas). Foregut fermentation is known to occur in four major clades of mammals
and in at least one avian species (the hoatzin). Hindgut fermentation, either in the caecum or large
intestine/colon, occurs in many clades of mammals, birds, reptiles and fishes, and some insects
(e.g., Termites). Modified from Karasov and Douglas (2013)

(particularly with the folding patterns of the absorptive tissues and cell membranes;
Karasov and Hume 1997).
How an animal digests its food generally falls into a “Rate vs Yield” continuum
(Clements and Raubenheimer 2006; German et al. 2015; Fig. 7.3). On one end,
there are rate maximizers that have high intake, rapid transit of material through
the gut, and an endogenous digestive process that mostly extracts soluble nutrients

**Fig. 7.3** Cumulative nutrient or energy gained by an animal as a function of time spent processing
a meal. **a** : For high quality food; **b** : for low quality food. The green horizontal dashed line represents
the extractable nutrient ingested in the meal. The slope of the red line “R” represents the maximum
rate at which the nutrient or energy can be absorbed from the meal. This is achieved by evacuating
the contents at time 1 (t1) and taking a new meal, although a portion of the nutrient or energy
consumed is lost in the feces (“wastage”). Maximum yield (blue line “Y”) is attained by extending
processing time to time 2 (t2), however, this is done at the cost of reduced digestive rate. For the
low quality food, long retention is unavoidable for maximum digestive rate. **c** : For two ingested

from ingested foods. These animals defecate the ingesta from the digestive system
before refractory material is digested, resulting in “wastage”, or nutrients that were
not acquired. Because these animals eat frequently, they will just take another meal
and make up for wastage through more intake. Transit times in these animals are
fast because of the high intake, and thus, they tend to have less reliance on microbial
digestion within their alimentary canals, with some rate-maximizing animals lacking
a demonstrable gut microbiome (Hammer et al. 2017). On the other hand, yield maximizers eat less, hold food for a longer period of time in their guts, and digest more of
the available nutrients or energy. A yield-maximizing digestive strategy can involve
enteric microbes since it provides the time investment needed by microbes, resulting
in higher digestive efficiency, even of refractory material that was indigestible to the
animal’s endogenous digestive process (Fig. 7.3). Even at the elevated temperatures
experienced in a mammalian gut, yield-maximizing herbivores reliant on microbial
degradation will have transit times of ingesta through the whole system of greater
than 20 h, whereas more rate-maximizing taxa that are reliant on endogenous digestive processes to digest more soluble nutrients will have shorter transit times (e.g.,
<10 h; Hofmann 1989). Animals eating more animal material will fall on the yieldmaximizing side of this continuum, but they tend to have a higher-quality diet than
herbivores adopting this strategy. Of course, many animals have diverse diets and
can slide along the rate vs yield continuum depending on what was ingested, but
they are limited in how far they can go in either direction by their gut morphology
(Fig. 7.2) and transit times (Fig. 7.3). Moreover, when one dissects ingesta into
specific nutrient categories, interesting patterns can emerge where an animal can
appear to be a rate maximizer for a common nutrient (e.g., cellulose), but a yield
maximizer for a targeted nutrient (e.g., protein; Fig. 7.3C). Hence, defining an animal
as a rate or yield maximizer can vary depending on the time and scale at which it is
examined.

Based on the discussion thus far, it is clear that digestion is a complex process
and to understand digestive efficiency, intake and transit time must be considered. In
addition to intake and transit time of material through the gut, nutrients (i.e., carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, nucleic acids) are usually acquired through the catalytic
breakdown by digestive enzymes, and the efficiency of those enzymes will vary
on several levels. Following Karasov and Hume (1997), and Karasov and Douglas
(2013), the following proportions are helpful to put gut function in the context of the
variables we have been covering thus far:

The digestive

efficiency of a given food is proportional to the amount and efficiency of digestive
enzymes present as a function of the substrate concentrations for those enzymes.
Thus, if a substrate is abundant in a given food type, then enzyme activities (e.g.,
amylase activity) against that substrate (e.g., starch) must be proportionally elevated
to digest the available substrate. This hypothesis, known broadly as the Adaptive
Modulation Hypothesis (Karasov 1992; Karasov and Martínez del Rio 2007),
is widely upheld for starch concentrations in the diet and the digestive enzyme

amylase, in a broad range of animals. There is a rich literature examining the genetic
underpinnings of this match between enzyme and substrate (e.g., Perry et al. 2007;
Axelsson et al. 2013; Heras et al. 2020), showing changes in gene copy number and
gene expression in different taxa.
More limiting, essential nutrients, like protein and lipid, can also invoke higher
enzyme activities to acquire these nutrients from diets low in them. When animals
ramp up digestive enzyme activities against more limiting nutrients, it is called
“Nutrient Balancing” (Clissold et al. 2010; Heras et al. 2020). There are good examples showing elevated lipase activities in fishes consuming high-fiber, low lipid diets
(German et al. 2004; Leigh et al. 2018; Heras et al. 2020), which has resulted in
expanded gene copy numbers of lipases in the genome (Heras et al. 2020). Consistent with the rate vs yield continuum, digesta held for extended periods of time in
the gut are more efficiently digested, and time is proportionally related to gut size as
a function of transit rates of digesta through the gut. Hence, if an animal has rapid
transit of material through the alimentary canal, they must have a larger gut to allow
for enough time to digest anything. Indeed, one of the hallmarks of digestive tract
morphology is that animals with lower quality diets have higher intake, and larger,
and longer guts (Fig. 7.4).
Once nutrients have been absorbed from the gut, further processing, usually in
a liver or hepatic-like organ, is required, and this may be where the downstream
limitations of dietary specialization manifest (Merkin et al. 2012; Betancor et al.
2018; Jin et al. 2018; Herrera et al. 2021). In mammals, and now in fishes, it is clear
that hepatic gene expression and metabolism is somewhat set by an animal’s genetics,
including epigenetics, at the population or species level. Hepatic gene expression
tends to not change dramatically with dietary fluctuations, instead reflecting the
genetic background of the organism (Herrera et al. 2021). The gut, on the other
hand, is more variable in gene expression, enzyme activity, and size in response
to dietary perturbations in the same individual (Sullam et al. 2015; Leigh et al.
2018; Herrera et al. 2021). No animal can simply use, transport, or store any and
all nutrient molecules with equal ease. Some nutrients, such as glucose, can be
used immediately for routine metabolic processes. But overly high initial spikes
even in glucose levels can cause metabolic problems, such as glycation, as well
as disruptions of the osmolarity of body fluids, which not all species can tolerate.
A variety of polypeptides could disrupt “hormonal” signaling among the animal’s
organs. Indeed, a “leaky gut” developing from lesions in the human intestine caused
by autoimmune problems that stem from a disruptive enteric microbiome, can lead
to the absorption of compounds (e.g., microbial peptides) that normally do not end
up in the blood stream. The metabolic outcomes can manifest in severe, systemic
autoimmune problems like Rheumatoid Arthritis or Multiple Sclerosis (Brandl et al.
2021). High levels of absorbed fats could produce mechanical strain for circulatory
organs, like hearts, across both open and closed circulatory systems. Dyslipidemia is
also the true precursor to insulin resistance in humans (Krssak et al. 1999; Montell
et al. 2001; Basciano et al. 2005; Dekker et al. 2010).
Finally, the functional allocation of nutrients across organ systems and functions
is not uniform. In a tradeoff known as “Capital vs Income” breeding, income breeders

family Stichaeidae, showing a gradient in the amount of algal material in the diet and gut length
relative to body size. Increasing the amount of refractory material in the diet leads to higher intake,
leading to more rapid transit of digesta through the gut, which in turn requires a longer gut to
maintain digestive efficiency (German 2011; Leigh et al. 2018). From top to bottom: *Cebidichthys*

*chirus* (omnivore), *Anoplarchus purpurescens* (carnivore). After German et al. (2014, 2015). The
slope of positive allometry of gut size relative to body size follows the gradient in algal material in
the diet (German et al. 2004; German et al. 2014), and that allometric pattern is maintained even
when the fishes are raised on a high-protein, animal-based diet in the laboratory (German and Horn
2006). Such a relationship between gut size and diet is inherent in nearly all animal clades examined
(Stevens and Hume 1995)

(e.g., many insect taxa) use almost all of their metabolically available nutrients for
immediate reproduction, whether synthesizing gametes, provisioning zygotes, or
even caring for their young. Capital breeders (e.g., some marine mammals), on the
other hand, build up extensive stores of nutrients for subsequent reproduction or for
later survival under conditions of restricted food availability (Davis et al. 2016).
Thus it is inevitable that no animal has or will ever evolve to be an ODB. All

animals specialize nutritionally, and this specialization can happen in the digestive
system itself (including the mouth, which can vary in shape, opening mechanism,
or dentition), or in downstream nutrient processing (Karasov and Martínez del Rio
2007). Animals seek different foods, behaviorally. They attack and devour different
foods, equipped with specific structures and behaviors for prey subjugation and
consumption. Even herbivores are confronted with plant adaptations, from thorns
to woody structures to poisons, that make their consumption of plants as food give
rise to natural selection for particular types of foraging and consumption, including
mechanical processing, detoxification, and catalytic processing.
As is apparent from the discussion above, there is a limited set of nutritional
adaptations that will always be beneficial, and therefore consistently and generally

fosteredbynaturalselection.Therehastobesomeflexibilityingutfunctiontoaccommodate fluctuations in resource availability, but there can be constraints built in (e.g.,
mouth shape or size, gut morphology, available digestive enzymes, enteric microbial
diversity) based on the animal’s phylogenetic history that can limit what they can efficiently digest, absorb, and metabolize. Nutritional adaptations may involve genetic
trade-offs, or “antagonistic pleiotropy,” that will lead to the evolution of different
nutritional adaptations among animal populations exploiting different sources of
food. Nutritional specialization is thus an inevitable product of evolution by natural
selection acting on animal species that confront different environments with different
body plans and physiologies. Humans can complicate the understanding of digestive
adaptations within primates since we cook our food, which is essentially predigesting
it with heat, chemicals, or microbial fermentations. Thus, there are limitations to what
can be inferred about human biology by studying other animals.
The core problem of animal specialization with respect to nutritional adaptation
then interacts with a variety of general evolutionary constraints on adaptation that
affect most, if not all, animal species. Among these constraints are evolutionary
history, ecological fluctuation, effective population size, and declining forces of
natural selection with age. We deal with each in turn.
###### **7.3 Evolutionary History**

Evolution by natural selection is not a globally optimizing process, contrary to the
suppositions of some applied mathematicians who dabbled in evolutionary theory
during the 1970s and 1980s (e.g. Gadgil and Bossert 1970). Instead, adaptation is
an historically contingent process that is subject to constraints which prevent the
achievement of optimal outcomes (Gould and Lewontin 1979; Rose and Lauder
1996).
As such, the functional biology of nutrition is conditioned by the prior evolutionary history of each and every animal species (e.g., German et al. 2004; Herrel
et al. 2008; Wehrle et al. 2020). Furthermore, recent research in the genomic foundations of adaptation has revealed that animal evolution is dominated by the fine-tuning
of extant genetic variation, rather than the wholesale introduction of novel mutations
that then undergo substitution (Burke et al. 2010; Burke 2012; Phillips et al. 2016;
Graves et al. 2017). For instance, the expansion in gene copy number in the salivary
amylase gene ( *amy1* ) in humans from agrarian backgrounds (Perry et al. 2007), and in
pancreatic amylase ( *amy2* ) in dogs in comparison to wolves (Axelsson et al. 2013) led
to advantageous increases in amylolytic activity to accommodate starchy diets. Thus
we should expect that the adaptations involved in the biology of nutrition involve
tinkering with the same basic functional elements (e.g., Heras et al. 2020), even
when such adaptations involve many-fold changes to physiological characters (vid.
Rose et al. 2004, 2005). An excellent example in the context of digestive physiology
is the wood-eating catfishes in the family Loricariidae. Although one might expect
these fishes consuming a wood diet would develop the adaptations (e.g., expanded


-----

132 D. P. German and M. R. Rose

hindgut that houses cellulolytic microbes; Fig. 7.2) seen in well-known wood-eating,
and digesting, animals like termites or beavers, the wood-eating catfishes maintain a
rather long, thin-walled intestine and a rate-maximizing digestive strategy consistent
with other loricariid catfishes (German 2009; German and Bittong 2009; Lujan et al.
2011; McCauley et al. 2020). Thus, wood-eating catfishes are detritivores that digest
the soluble nutrients in their detrital diet and virtually none of the cellulose (German
2009; German and Bittong 2009; German and Miles 2010; Lujan et al. 2011). Furthermore, wood-eating has evolved three separate times in that family (Lujan et al. 2017),
each time with the same outcome (poor wood digestibility), and the only “adaptive”
feature being the repeated evolution of thick, cupped teeth that are excellent for
scraping wood. Thus, some parts of the digestive system (i.e., the mouth) showed
changes, but others did not (German 2009; German and Bittong 2009), suggesting
that selection can indeed act on some aspects of nutritional biology, but loricariids
are otherwise rate-maximizing in their approach to intake and digestion which limits
what nutrients they can efficiently digest and assimilate.
In the same way that cetacean respiration uses lungs rather than gills, we should
expect that the evolutionary biology of digestive systems within sizeable taxonomic
groups will nonetheless feature variations on common adaptations for feeding, digestion, and the processing of nutrients within intermediary metabolism. Excellent
examples of this abound within entire families of fishes where the gastric stomach
has been lost (Wilson and Castro 2011; Castro et al. 2014), yet a gut that is essentially only an intestine can digest a wide array of food items ranging from detritus,
to plankton, to animal material, to algae. Absent gut commensals, we should not
expect to find animals which can evolve to consume radically novel foods, with
one salient exception. That exception would be humans that have learned how to use
extra-somatic tools for foraging and processing foods; we will address this exception
later in this article.

genetic variation readily tracks shifting selection regimes, due to the relative rarity of
selective sweeps that proceed to fixation (e.g. Burke et al. 2016; Graves et al. 2017).
Rutledge et al. (2020, 2021) have recently published evidence showing rapid
adaptation to banana-molasses medium among fruit flies cultured on that food for
hundreds of generations, despite an evolutionary history that did not feature use of


-----

bananas for nutrition. These same fruit flies have never been exposed to orangebased medium, and show measureable deficits in adaptation to that novel diet. [We
will return to this example of dietary adaptation later.]
Yet most animals will face seasonal and other climatic variation in the availability
of foods that are within their capacity to ingest and digest. To the extent to which
such variation is considerable, then evolution by natural selection may do a poor
job of adapting species like small, short-lived insects to such variable diets. Natural
selection may have not tracked such ecological fluctuations well in specific insect
lineages, or led to different generations actually specializing on different resources.
On the other hand, larger and longer-lived animal species, such as most mammals
and many birds, may be selected to accommodate the range of foods that arise
over the course of lifespans that stretch across multiple years. In this way, such
species may develop the ability to adjust their nutritional physiology in a manner
that accommodates considerable ecological variation in food supplies. For example,
birds that experience considerable seasonal fluxes in available foods (e.g., fruits vs
seeds), or migrate into different habitats with different resources, do indeed show
digestive flexibility (Karasov and Martinez del Rio 2007). A well-cited example with
yellow-rumped warblers shows that it takes greater than six days for the digestive
physiology of the bird to transition from a fruit diet to a seed diet (Fig. 7.5). In fishes,
it can take as few as four weeks for a gut to show incredible plasticity to dietary

shifts, but again, it is the liver that doesn’t necessarily adjust to the influx of different
nutrient classes (Herrera et al. 2021).
Nonetheless, given the commonplace pattern of seasonal and episodic variation
in climate, and thus food availability, most species should have their adaptations to
the consumption and digestion of varying foods impaired *relative to* their ability to
adapt to the consumption of consistently available foods (Leigh et al. 2018). Such
impairment can arise at many functional levels, from feeding behavior to dentition to
digestion (Figs. 7.2, 7.3) to metabolic use of varied foods. Again, this is a corollary
of the core principle that trade-offs prevent the evolution of an ODB, that can eat
anything equally well.
###### **7.5 Effective Population Size and Inbreeding**

One of the chief findings of theoretical and experimental work on the evolutionary
genetic machinery of adaptation is the importance of effective population size (“N e ”)
(Lynch and Walsh 1998). As N e decreases, the response to selection demonstrably
attenuates. This is not usually a problem for abundant species evolving in the wild,
but it is a considerable difficulty for less abundant species in the wild, as well as
virtually all laboratory stocks, which are kept at much smaller N e compared to their
wild ancestors.

This fundamental limitation on the power of natural selection will prevent adaptation to novel foods in animal populations that are at lower population sizes. Note that
this problem is expected to afflict an animal population (i) that has recently colonized
a new habitat, (ii) that has undergone population declines as a result of climatic and
other ecological changes reducing availability of its favored foods, or (iii) that has
been sampled from nature for rearing in a laboratory setting. These challenges are
notably common in the face of ecological disruptions arising from anthropogenic
change, deliberate or inadvertent. **7.6 Declining Forces of Natural Selection with Adult Age**

Another fundamental problem facing the evolution of nutritional adaptations is the
declining forces of natural selection with adult age in animal populations with agestructure (Hamilton 1966; Charlesworth 1980). Such declines will produce agedependent deterioration in nutritional adaptations even on a long-standing diet. In
addition, recent major changes of diet will foster rapid evolution of nutritional adaptations at early ages, but not later ages (Rutledge et al. 2020, 2021). Below we discuss
this limitation to nutritional adaptation in the context of both laboratory experiments
and human nutrition.

###### ***7.6.1 Application One: Physiological Studies of Recently*** ***Caught Wild Animals***

Nutritional studies on wild-caught animals go back centuries. The most detailed
studies come from those animals that we raise for consumption: a handful of ruminants, pigs, chickens, and a limited number of mostly carnivorous fishes. Most
studies of animals cultured for human consumption focus on getting the animals
to grow the quickest, producing the most flesh for us to eat. However, this has led to
detailed studies of digestion and metabolism, the development of chemical methods
to examine the digestibility of feedstuffs (Van Soest 1994), and what happens with
animal flesh once the animal is killed. The physiological genomic approaches using
different lines of these cultured animals have revealed how, through artificial selection, we have generated animals that digest the grain-based foods we feed them with
varying efficiency. The main exception being cattle consuming large amounts of
corn-based feeds requiring the use of antibiotics. The antibiotics serve two purposes:
they keep the animals from falling ill despite eating foods that aren’t optimal for
foregut fermenters (i.e., they should be eating grasses directly), and the antibiotics
cause the animals to grow faster. It now takes about 15 months to grow a calf to a
size fit for slaughter, whereas just seventy years ago it took nearly six years (Pollan
2006). Of course, just because they grow faster, doesn’t mean they are healthier, and
in fact, the animals are obese, leading to the meat being more marbled with fat than
in the past (i.e., there is a double novelty here: rapid growth of the animal, and a
human food source that is fattier than in the past). The mechanism of faster growth
in antibiotic-treated animals remains incompletely understood, but may be linked to
a shift in the enteric microbiome towards an “obese” microbiome.

Although there was a literature on nutritional adaptations prior to the 1980’s
(again, largely focused on animals raised for human consumption, or in zoo settings),
in terms of western science, evolutionary nutritional physiology really emerged
from the laboratory of Dr. Jared Diamond at University of California, Los Angeles.
Although Dr. Diamond is broadly known for bird and island biogeography, and more
recently, his popular science and societal writing, his training and laboratory studies
focused on nutritional physiology and biochemistry. Studies out of the Diamond
lab examined nutrient transport rates across the intestinal epithelium, and rates of
enzymatic hydrolysis of various substrates in many different taxa in accordance with
their natural diets. A core tenet of the work is the “Krogh Principle”, which states
that “for such a large number of problems there will be some animal of choice,
or a few such animals, on which it can be most conveniently studied” (Krebs and
Krebs 1980). That is, for a given question on a given animal system, there will be a
species or line of animal that allows a researcher to most efficiently answer the question at hand. Indeed, the sheer number of vertebrate animal models (e.g., mammals,
birds, amphibians, fish) used in the Diamond lab supports this contention. However,
the diverse nature of the work itself established nutritional physiology in evolutionary and comparative contexts outside of the biomedical field. Although Optimal
Foraging Theory (MacArthur and Pianka 1966; Pyke 1984) had certainly set the


-----

136 D. P. German and M. R. Rose

stage for thinking about what animals eat and the consequences of this on an ecological scale, Diamond’s work (and that of his lab colleagues) showed that the gut itself
was central to the entire process and that it, therefore, must be considered in studies
of nutritional ecology in an evolutionary context (Karasov and Diamond 1988).
The list of students and postdoctoral researchers who emerged from the Diamond
Laboratory is impressive, and each made impacts on the field. Two in particular,
Dr. William Karasov (University of Wisconsin; cited extensively in this chapter),
and Dr. Stephen Secor (University of Alabama), have published hundreds of studies
with their trainees and colleagues on how the gut responds to dietary perturbations
(summarized in Karasov and Martínez del Rio 2007), feeding frequency (Secor and
Diamond 2000), or how animals may be adapted to use specific resources (e.g.,
various forms of carbohydrates; Brun et al. 2020).
Core tenets emerging from the Diamond laboratory include the concepts of “evolutionary match” [rooted in Symmorphosis (Weibel et al. 1991) and including the
concept of “Reserve Capacity”], and the “Adaptive Modulation Hypothesis”. Within
these hypotheses, it is argued that processes, like biochemical pathways, require the
expression of proteins (enzymes, transporters) the synthesis of which costs ATP, and
if embedded in a membrane, take up valuable space. Hence, a cost–benefit analysis
suggests that pathway proteins should not be expressed at levels far exceeding what is
needed by the system, nor should they be under-expressed so as to form bottle necks.
Diamond (2002) argues that, typically, reserve capacities of 2-3X what is needed (in
some cases up to 10X) are within the norm and allow an animal to handle larger fluxes
in nutrients through pathways than are typically experienced, even titling an article
“enough, but not too much” (Diamond and Hammond 1992). Several other studies
have followed up on this in metabolic pathways, generally finding support (e.g.,
Salvador and Savageau 2006), and theoretical examinations suggest redundancy in
regulation of pathway robustness (Frank 2007). However, this view is not without
its critiques (Dudley and Gans 1991), especially relating to structural components,
like bones or tendons. But, for pathways like digestion and absorption of individual
nutrients, where specific enzymes and transporters are needed for each step of the
process, reserve capacities appear to make sense, and led to the “Adaptive Modulation
Hypothesis” (AMH; Karasov 1992; Karasov and Martínez del Rio 2007).
As originally postulated, and aligning the nutrient supply organ with Optimal
Foraging Theory, the AMH suggests that rates of nutrient hydrolysis at the intestinal
brushborder and absorption of nutrients like glucose, should match with ingested
loads of the nutrient over evolutionary time scales (Karasov 1992). Indeed, numerous
studies in a wide range of wild-caught animal taxa have found support for the AMH,
particularly relating to carbohydrate digestion (e.g., Diamond and Hammond 1992;
Perry et al. 2007; Karasov and Martínez del Rio, 2007; Kohl et al. 2011; German et al.
2010; Axelsson et al. 2013; German et al. 2015; Heras et al. 2020; Brun et al. 2020).
Although there is some support for protein digestion following similar patterns in
some animals (Schondube et al. 2001), this pattern is not universal (Buddington et al.
1987) because all animals need protein, whereas carnivores consume low amounts
of carbohydrates and may have metabolism that is geared for gluconeogenesis from
amino acids, or others a ketotic metabolism tied to enteric fermentations (Willmott


-----

7 Notes Toward an Evolutionary Biology of Nutrition 137

et al. 2005; Heras et al. 2020). Another aspect of the AMH is that limiting micronutrients, like vitamins and minerals, may have the opposite pattern: when these essential
nutrientsareinshortsupply,ananimalmayupregulateintestinaltransportersforthem
to ensure scavenging of these nutrients from their dilute diet. These patterns are also
generally supported (Karasov and Martínez del Rio 2007). Recent work in herbivorous fishes suggests that this may also apply to lipid because essential fatty acids must
be obtained from a diet that is already low in lipid, and fiber binds to fat, making it less
available than in animal material. Hence, it is common to observe elevated lipolytic
activities in the guts of herbivorous fishes, which also show expanded gene copy
number for lipase genes (German et al. 2004; Leigh et al. 2018; Heras et al. 2020).
Most other specializations largely stay in accord with the Rate vs Yield continuum
discussed above (Fig. 7.3).
Because of the Krogh principle, studies of nutritional physiology of wild-caught
animals have relied upon the comparative method to infer specializations. Many
studies are on single species and qualitative comparisons are made with other organisms. Modern work in a phylogenetic context, utilizing closely related species with
different dietary affinities, have revealed specializations by exposing animals to
dietary perturbations in a laboratory setting, and observing what changes and what
doesn’t, or making use of natural clines. Such studies have revealed that digestive
enzyme activities and nutrient transport rates of carbohydrates do indeed support the
AMH broadly. A deeper dive into the molecular underpinnings of common patterns
is warranted, but already it has been shown that not all increases in amylase activity,
for example, are underlain by changes in amylase gene copy number (German et al.
2016; Heras et al. 2020). In other words, there is more than one way to skin a cat
to achieve the same physiological phenotype. Nevertheless, laboratory studies of
wild-caught animals have indeed led to a formulation of the general principles of
digestion, and when put in the context of chemical reactor theory (Penry and Jumars
1987), actually provides great benefit to biomedical sciences in addition to comparative and evolutionary physiology. Rodent models in digestion and metabolism have
continually failed to be totally utilitarian, leaving researchers looking for additional
models, which can be found broadly in the animal kingdom. Animal populations
reared in the laboratory can prove useful in this regard.
###### ***7.6.2 Application Two: Nutritional Research with Laboratory*** ***Domesticated Populations***

A great deal of research on nutrition is conducted using animals stocks that have
been maintained in the laboratory for a number of generations. These species range
from rodents, such as *Mus musculus*, to insects, such as *Drosophila melanogaster.*
The previously described difficulties create considerable problems for the use of
such laboratory animals for studying the evolutionary biology of nutrition. We will
discuss the importance of each in turn.


-----

138 D. P. German and M. R. Rose

***Evolutionary History:*** Almost all laboratory studies of nutrition which use established laboratory stocks are conducted on small animals, no bigger than dogs or
cats. The laboratory rodents that are commonly studied afford an inherently limited
window into the evolutionary biology of nutrition, even among mammals. In this
regard, rodents may be particularly poor models for human nutritional biology, with
a glaring difference being that rodents have an intact uricase gene (and enzyme)
that makes their metabolism of fructose categorically different from higher primates
(including humans), which lack an expressed and active uricase enzyme (Lanaspa
et al. 2012; Kratzer et al. 2014). Thus, the elevated consumption of processed,
fructose-rich foods that result in considerable hepatic uric acid production (and downstream effects) in humans produce problems that are **not** completely analogous with
how rodents metabolize fructose in their livers (discussed in more detail below).

Among insects, the most commonly used species are those that can survive and
reproduce on foods which can be readily supplied in labs, such as fruit flies and
*Tribolium* species. Insect parasitoids, for example, feed off the living guts of other
insects, but are rarely cultured in the laboratory. Despite that, they are among the
most abundant of all insect species.
Thus our most penetrating and extensive studies of the biology of nutrition are
limited by the evolutionary histories of the kinds of species that are most commonly
studied. Groups with radically different kinds of evolutionary histories are not known
in comparable detail, and thus, we are in need of more lines of laboratory animals
evolved on different diets to study closely how an animal’s digestive system and
metabolism change to meet new nutritional needs.

***Ecological Change:*** Every species that is brought into laboratories and cultured
therein is undergoing a major ecological change from its first generation of lab maintenance. Natural selection will then set about adapting such laboratory populations
to their new lab environment, especially with respect to the type(s) of food that are
provided to them (e.g., Leigh et al. 2018).

Thus it is mistake to believe that such laboratory stocks provide a reliable window
into the nutritional biology of the species in general. Research projects using laboratory populations of any species are necessarily a study of how that species responds
to the evolutionary predicament of consuming often a single laboratory diet, among
other features of the laboratory environment.
In effect, every experiment conducted with long-cultured laboratory stocks is an
experiment in the field that is known as “experimental evolution” (Garland and Rose,
2009), whether the experimenter is aware of it or not. And if there is any type of
selection which is likely to be fast acting, it is selection to adapt a population to a
novel laboratory diet (Leigh et al 2018). Such selection will not usually be focused
chiefly on juvenile survival, if the food being supplied is sufficient for the completion
of development. Instead, the more likely targets of selection are adult longevity and
reproduction (Fig. 7.6). That in turn is fraught with possibilities for age-dependent
heterogeneity, as we will discuss below.

***Reduced N*** ***e*** ***and inbreeding:*** Another inadvertent effect of laboratory cultivation
will be greatly reduced N e . And in some fields, such as population genetics, experimenters will actively inbreed laboratory stocks. An extreme example of this is the
creation of “isofemale lines” from generation after generation of laboratory culture
using only the progeny of sibling matings. Such heavily inbred lines are almost
completely homozygous.
Whether moderate or severe, inbreeding degrades adaptation. Inbred stocks will
have impaired nutritional adaptations on *any* diet. Furthermore, the ability of inbred
laboratory strains to adapt to the novel laboratory diet will be specifically degraded.
In addition to this predictable “inbreeding depression” of functional characters
from inbreeding and the failure of inbred lines to adapt to novel laboratory conditions,
a collection of inbred lines will randomly diverge from their wild ancestors (Santos

**Fig. 7.7** Fructose metabolism in hepatocytes. Because 95% of all assimilated fructose is metabolized in the liver, an excessive carbon load is processed via glycolytic pathways, but starting with
Fructose Kinase. This first step is consumptive of ATP and leads to significant uric acid production
(Johnson et al. 2009; Lanaspa et al. 2012), which itself leads to oxidative stress in the cell. Although
most of the fructose eventually enters the mitochondrion for entry into the Kreb’s Cycle (thick black
arrow), some F-1,6-BP is converted to Xylolose-5-Phosphate, which, through a cascade, activates
Carbohydrate Responsive Element Binding Protein (ChREBP), which activates the fat synthesis
cascade (Kabashima et al. 2003). Combined with the effects of uric acid (indicated by *, and detailed
in Figure 7.8), this ensures a large amount of citrate exits the mitochondrion, resulting in excess
fat production from fructose carbon. The resulting excess very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)
concentrations in the blood leads to dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance (IR) by muscles (Krssak
et al. 1999; Montell et al. 2001; Basciano et al. 2005; Dekker et al. 2010). Excess lipid returning to
the liver leads to Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD; Ouyang et al. 2008; Dekker et al.
2010; Zámbó et al. 2013; Jegatheesan and De Bandt 2017; Jensen et al. 2018), and the associated
inflammation leads to IR (and additional oxidative stress) in the liver (Rutledge and Adeli 2007;
Dekker et al. 2010; Lim et al. 2010). With IR by many tissues, the pancreas over-produces insulin,
leading to hyperinsulinemia (Lustig 2006; Shanik et al. 2008); this blocks the sensing of leptin at
the brain (Kellerer et al. 2001; Shapiro et al. 2011), thus not allowing leptin to stimulate the satiety
center and leaving the hunger center activated (Friedman and Halaas 1998; Ahima and Flier 2000;
Isganatis and Lustig 2005). Leptin resistance leads to overeating, typically of energy dense foods,
especially fructose. This repeating loop leads Type two diabetes to (T2D) (Isganatis and Lustig
2005). **Thick** arrows indicate large carbon loads. **Red** arrows and labels indicate metabolic abnormalities caused by excess fructose consumption. Dashed lines indicate multiple steps represented

**Fig. 7.8** The action of uric acid within a hepatocyte. Large amounts of uric acid are generated by
excessive fructose metabolism and humans lack a working uricase enzyme (due to pseudogenization
of the uricase gene; Kratzer et al. 2014) to degrade that uric acid. Excess uric acid causes oxidative
stress in the cell, which causes the enzyme NADPH Oxidase 4 (NOX4) to migrate from its normal
location in the cytoplasm, into the mitochondrion. Once in the mitochondrion, NOX4 is a powerful
inhibitor of the Kreb’s Cycle enzyme aconitase, which produces isocitrate from citrate. With aconitase inhibited, citrate piles up in the mitochondrion, and thus, leaks out in significant quantities
(thick arrow) into the cytosol for use in fat production (see Fig. 7.7). Thus, other elements of fructose metabolism [carbon load at the liver (thick arrow into mitochondrion), xylulose-5-phosphate
production upregulating fat synthesis enzymes] aid in fat production, but uric acid ensures that the
starting point of fat synthesis (citrate) is in the cytosol in large amounts. Metabolic abnormalities

et al. 2013). Thus, not only are inbred strains degraded, they are also randomly
divergent. Worse material for the study of any type of functional biology is hard to
imagine, excepting perhaps inbred lines that have been subjected to genome-wide
mutagenesis using radiation or mutagenic compounds.
Yet such inbred and degraded organisms are the commonplace subjects of research
on such phenomena as dietary restriction and the effects of dietary supplements (e.g.
Weindruch and Walford 1988). For example, it is now known that while some lab
rodent strains respond to dietary restriction with increased lifespan, other rodent
strains do not. That is to say, the “reaction norm” that determines the response of
lifespan to varying dietary intake is dependent on the genetic background of particular
rodent lab strains. Reaction norms are examples of phenotypic plasticity, and the
evolution of phenotypic plasticity is a long-standing and important subject within
evolutionary biology. Such evolutionary phenomena should be taken into account in
studies of the functional biology of nutrition among laboratory organisms.

***Age-Dependent Adaptation:*** In laboratory populations that have not been deliberately inbred, but have been domesticated over as few as forty generations, we can
expect considerable adaptation to laboratory conditions (Matos et al. 2000). It might


-----

142 D. P. German and M. R. Rose

then be supposed that the evolutionary biology of nutrition in such laboratory populations therefore reflects overall adaptation to the food supplied to them, again, usually
a single laboratory diet.

But that would be a mistake. The forces of natural selection will scale adaptation
according to age, with juveniles and young adults achieving high levels of adaptation
to the laboratory food. But the declining forces of natural selection suggest that older
adults will not adapt to the novel laboratory diet as well as younger organisms. This
problem has in fact been demonstrated in the work of Rutledge et al. (2020, 2021).
In flies that had long been selected for the use of banana-molasses medium, they
found that younger flies did as well or better on that diet compared to either a novel
orange medium or a crude emulation of their long-abandoned apple diet (Fig. 7.6).
But at later adult ages, the same flies did as well on an orange diet as they did on
the banana. Furthermore, at those later adult ages, these flies had *enhanced* survival
and reproduction on lab medium that crudely emulated their long-abandoned apple
diet. This is a signal example of the degree to which the design and interpretation of
laboratory research on the evolutionary biology of nutrition should be informed by
knowledge of the specific constraints that evolution places on the functional biology
of nutrition.
###### ***7.6.3 Application Three: Nutritional Research with Human*** ***Patients***

Human populations have a number of advantages with respect to the study of their
nutritional biology, at least from an evolutionary perspective. Here we will again
organize our discussion in terms of the same four evolutionary considerations that
we have used hitherto.

***Evolutionary History and Ecological Change:*** Humans are a relatively good target
for research on the evolutionary biology of their nutrition. Above all, physical anthropologists have been extensively studying the evolutionary history of the patterns of
food acquisition, processing, and consumption of our species. We have a fairly good
idea of our food consumption patterns over the last million years: omnivory with
extensive food processing, including the cooking of both animal tissues and otherwise toxic starchy foods. Different human populations vary with respect to the mix
of animal and plant tissues used for nutrition, but extreme carnivory or herbivory
were apparently rare before the advent of agriculture, up to 20,000 years ago.

Most importantly, it is well-known that most of our recently ancestral populations
underwent a major change in food acquisition and consumption with the Neolithic
agricultural revolution. Initially, it is clear that this dietary change had a substantially
deleterious impact on human health, as shown in the skeletal remains from populations that underwent that change. But there is significant evidence for biological
adaptation to the agricultural diet among Eurasian populations, with a continuum of


-----

7 Notes Toward an Evolutionary Biology of Nutrition 143

adaptation from those populations to those of Australasia, the most recently agricultural large collection of human populations (e.g., Perry et al. 2007; Enattah et al.
2008). [There are also some minor non-agricultural populations that are peripheral
to regions where people practiced agriculture, such as the Inuit of North America
and the indigenous tribes of the Amazonian and Congolese rainforests.]
Finally, it is generally understood that the last few centuries have seen the
widespread consumption of largely novel foods, from refined sugar to heavily
processed “junk foods”, to marbled meats, as mentioned above. Thus much recent
nutritional physiology reflects a virtual absence of natural selection fostering
adaptation to such novel “industrial” foods.
Perhaps one of the clearest examples is fructose metabolism in the human liver.
Ancestral human diets had sucrose in fruits, some plant parts (e.g., beet root), and
in honey. The first examples are encased in fibrous cell walls, and only available
seasonally in many locations, the latter defended by bees (Lustig 2012). Thus, sucrose
was somewhat difficult to obtain, even after mastication. With the advent of food
processing, food processors realized that humans were drawn to sugar, and in fact,
could become addicted to it. Thus, they added it, in large quantities, to processed
foods, first as granulated sugar, then as high-fructose corn syrup after the Farm Bill
of 1973 led to a glut of corn available for processing. Sugar consumption really
took off after the 1982 “low fat guidelines” went into effect. These guidelines by
the US congress suggested that Americans limit fat consumption to 30% of their
daily caloric intake. This led food processors to make an array of new, “low-fat” or
“non-fat” foods. Of course, fat tastes good, so when it is removed from food, the
food doesn’t taste good. This led to the addition of more sugar in processed foods
to make it more palatable, and thus begun the obesity and type 2 diabetes epidemic
(Lustig 2012).
In humans, 95% of fructose is metabolized in the liver. This leads to many problems, but the main issue is that if greater than about 10% of daily caloric intake is
composed of sucrose, the fructose overloads the liver with a large carbon load that
must be metabolized (Fig. 7.7). The way that fructose is brought into hepatocytes and
metabolized there is categorically different than for glucose for many reasons. First,
the phosphorylation of fructose is consumptive of ATP with little ATP given back in
reward, and this process ends up generating Uric Acid (Fig. 7.7). Second, the activation of carbohydrate response element binding protein ensures that fat synthesis
pathways are upregulated to use the excess citrate that will eventually be produced in,
and leave, the mitochondria. The fat synthesis pathway leads to excess fat production
from the fructose carbon, dyslipidemia, and eventually insulin resistance (Fig. 7.7).
If it goes on long enough, insulin resistance can lead to extensive liver inflammation,
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes (hyperinsulinemia)
can lead to leptin resistance, which leads to further overeating, and thus, reinforcement of the entire pathway. Hence, over consumption of sugar across hundreds or
thousands of meals, leads to the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes plaguing
society, and it all starts with over consumption of fructose (Fig. 7.7), not glucose,
per se (Stanhope et al. 2009).

Tiedinwiththisisuricacid(Fig. 7.8).Asmentionedabove,uricacidisproducedin
large amounts in hepatic fructose metabolism (Lanaspa et al. 2012), and humans lack
a working uricase enzyme to break down this excess uric acid (Kratzer et al. 2014).
Beyond gout, uric acid leads to many problems on its own, including hypertension
by inhibiting nitric oxide synthase, and to massive oxidative stress in hepatic mitochondria (Fig. 7.8). Essentially, elevated hepatic uric acid leads to a depolarization
of the mitochondrial membrane potential, allows a cytoplasmic enzyme (NADPH
oxidase 4) to enter the mitochondria, where it inhibits aconitase. Aconitase is the
enzyme in the Citric Acid Cycle that converts citrate to isocitrate. Thus, this causes
citrate to pile up and leave the mitochondria to enter fat synthesis, which is already
upregulated by the fructose metabolic pathway (Fig. 7.8). Hence, excess uric acid
ensures that fructose carbon will end up as fat. The lack of a working uricase enzyme
in higher primates sets us apart from other mammals, such as monkeys, rodents, pigs,
or other animal models (Kratzer et al. 2014). Therefore, there is no excellent model
for human liver metabolism other than perhaps isolated human liver cells, which
pose their own problems by not being part of the larger physiological organism.

***Effective Population Size and Inbreeding:*** Another considerable advantage in the
study of the functional biology of human nutrition is that we remain a “wild” population from the standpoint of population size and inbreeding depression. Our populations are not undergoing deliberate or inadvertent reductions in effective population
size, so that inbreeding depression is not a common problem in studies of human
nutrition.

***Age-Dependent Forces of Natural Selection:*** The trickiest aspect of the functional
biology of human nutrition is the interaction between our evolutionary and ecological
history, on one hand, and the evolutionary biology of our aging, on the other hand.
That is because there are effectively three different evolutionary forces acting on us
simultaneously, each corresponding to different epochs in our evolutionary history,
and to different phases of our life histories.

(i ) Ou r ancien t evolutionar y histor y underpin s ou r lifelon g nutritiona l physiology,
eve n t o ver y lat e ages. For at least a million years, humans have been selected for
adaptations to a relatively abundant and easily digested diet. With the invention of an
extensive and efficient repertoire of tools for hunting, foraging, and food-processing
more than a million years ago, our dietary intake was transformed. This is reflected
in multiple unusual features of our nutritional anatomy and physiology.
Human dentition features teeth that are no longer used to attack other animals,
or even conspecifics. We also lack thick enamel, continued adult growth of teeth, or
continued replacement of lost teeth during adulthood, unlike some other mammalian
species for which teeth play a large role in the mechanical crushing or tearing of
food material. Evidently, this reflects dental evolution in the context of millions of
years of tool use for hunting, gathering, and food processing, from spears to digging
implements to pounding with stones. In a sense, our primary feeding “implements”
are hand-held tools, not teeth. Because we “pre-masticate” our foods, we don’t spend
up to 80% of our time chewing, as our ancestors did.


-----

7 Notes Toward an Evolutionary Biology of Nutrition 145

The human gut is also different from that of many other mammals. The human
stomach does not produce abundant acid to kill potential parasites, as in obligate
carnivores. Indeed, the evolution of the stomach in elasmobranchs was a novel,
vertebrate innovation, and it has changed much in many animal lineages, including
its loss multiple times (Wilson and Castro 2011; perhaps most recently in humans
undergoing gastric bypass surgery). As mentioned earlier, cooking is an entirely
humanendeavor.Althoughmanyanimals,frominsects,tosnails,tofishes,farmfoods
for consumption, none of them deliberately cook their foods with heat, chemicals,
or fermentations, before consuming them. Hence, humans are unique in that they
“predigest” foods by cooking them. One of the main outcomes of cooking is the
denaturation of proteins, which have led to a stomach pH (2) that is not as acidic as
strict carnivores. Beyond the denaturation of protein, cooking and grinding our foods
also makes fiber less of a barrier to digestion, meaning we are less reliant on enteric
microbes to degrade fibrous material than our hominid ancestors or closely related
apes. Thus, human intestines lack a large caecum for culturing commensal microbes
to provide nutrients, particularly calories from fiber degradation. Instead, the human
gastrointestinal tract seems to have evolved toward the absorption of nutrients that
have been made relatively accessible through the use of cooking and other types of
food preparation.
In a treatise on the evolution of cooking, Wrangham (2009) argues that cooking
with fire was essential in human evolution. Once we started cooking foods, particularly animal material, our braincase increased in size, and tools became more sophisticated. One of the things that fire does is that it causes the crosslinking of proteins
with glucose in what is known as the “Maillard” or browning reaction. The browning
reaction releases glutamate, which is what is sensed by our umami taste buds. Hence,
in many ways, we have evolved to be drawn to glutamate-rich foods, and cooking
makes that more available with the browning reaction. This is also not lost on food
processors, who add monosodium glutamate to foods to make them hyperpalatable. Moreover, in addition to denaturing proteins, cooking with heat sterilizes food,
making a highly acidic stomach of true carnivores not as necessary for humans since
the microbial load ingested with our food is reduced through cooking.
With so much of human digestion achieved extra-somatically, and a long-ancestral
diet that featured omnivory, it is a common assumption that humans are essentially
“pan-omnivorous,” with a capacity to derive nutrition for almost any food that is not
toxic. But we believe that this is an important mistake. There is no reason to expect
that any human is well-adapted to the consumption of foods that are fundamentally
novel, relative to our evolutionary history. No human population has evolved with
sustained,highlevelsofsucroseconsumption.Nohumanpopulationhasevolvedwith
sustained, high levels of consumption of low-fat, high-starch, high-salt, chemicallyladen, fiberless junk foods, such as those which can be found in the middle aisles of
most Western supermarkets. While human bodies do absorb abundant calories from
such foods, these foods are nonetheless not foods that we are well-adapted to. Thus it
is not surprising from these evolutionary considerations that the “Standard American
Diet” (“SAD”) is associated with higher levels of chronic illness, compared to the
more traditionally agricultural “Mediterranean Diet.” Of course, low-fiber diets are

linkedwithanalteredlargeintestinemicrobiome,whichmayhavedownstreamhealth
effects, including autoimmune disorders. With the recommendation of 25–60 g of
fiber a day, most Americans only get 10–15 g. A recent Course-based Undergraduate
Research Experience (CURE) course at UC Irvine showed how a high-fiber diet
intervention shifted the microbiome of the participating students (Oliver et al. 2021).

(ii ) Wit h th e Neolithi c agricultura l revolution, human s hav e bee n strongl y selected
fo r biologica l adaptation s t o diet s base d chiefl y o n th e consumptio n o f larg e grass
species. Most humans now descend from populations that have chiefly fed on foods
obtained through agricultural cultivation of large grass species: grains, rice, and corn,
chiefly. Some Old World populations have also consumed foods derived from the
milk of herd animals, chiefly ungulates. This was a major “ecological” change for the
action of natural selection on human nutritional biology. And such natural selection
has been sustained for hundreds of ancestral generations for much of the present
human species.
Such sustained natural selection will necessarily have significant effects on human
nutritional adaptation. Our long-ancestral diets generally featured omnivory, with
an exceptional diversity of foods consumed by hunter-gatherer populations. By
contrast, agricultural diets for the majority of “civilized” human populations lack
diversity. In addition, both grass species and ungulate milk feature an abundance
of pro-inflammatory agents. Grass species yield seeds that contain a great deal of
omega-6 fatty acids. Ungulate milk, particularly in animals fed corn-based diets, is
laden with short polypeptides, and branched amino acids, that are known to stimulate the adaptive immune system of calves. Humans who lack agricultural ancestry
are well known to suffer a variety of chronic inflammatory disorders when they
are subjected to agricultural diets (Lindeberg et al. 2007). By contrast, individuals
who have relatively more ancestry from areas that feature milk-derived foods show
longer maintenance of lactase production (Lindeberg et al. 2007; Enattah et al. 2008).
Overall, it is apparent that agricultural human populations have become biologically
adapted to the sustained consumption of agricultural foods, from bread to cheese to
boiled rice. At least at early ages.

(iii ) Later-lif e reversio n t o pre-agricultura l nutritiona l biology. The evolutionary
theory of ageing is fundamentally predicated on some degree of age-specificity in
genetic effects on life history across biological ages (Rose 1991). Without such
age-specificity, ageing is not expected to evolve.
The same principle in turn applies to the immediate evolution of species in
response to a major ecological change. As shown by Rutledge et al. (2020, 2021),
adaptation to a sustained change in diet produces strong dietary adaptation at early
ages, but weaker adaptation at later ages (Fig. 7.6). In the case of human populations
with agricultural ancestry, we can therefore expect that at later ages adaptations to
agricultural diets will weaken. Eventually, given continued survival to later ages, the
better diet may be one which emulates a diet that is no longer based chiefly on grass
species or the milk of ungulates. That is to say, at late enough ages, reversion to a
“Paleolithic Diet” may yield improved chronic health, with possibly reduced risk of
chronic disorders like type 2 diabetes and some types of cardiovascular disease.

7 Notes Toward an Evolutionary Biology of Nutrition 147

Note, however, that this is not an argument in favor of universal adoption of such
diets. Children and young adults from human populations that have long consumed
agricultural foods should be relatively well-adapted to such foods.
###### **7.7 Conclusion**

Theodosius Dobzhansky famously said, “Nothing in biology makes sense except in
the light of evolution.” We believe that this is certainly true with respect to nutritional
biology, where evolutionary history, ecological change, inbreeding, and age will all
have species-specific effects that will need to be taken into account in scientific
research on the topic. The field of nutritional physiology, particularly in evolutionary
and ecological contexts (i.e., outside of culturing animals for human consumption),
is in its infancy. Much work remains to be done to tease apart how each facet of the
inner tube of life truly feeds the fire of metabolism that is life itself. One thing is for
sure, though, we cannot throw away the gut anymore. It deserves our full attention.

###### **8.1 Introduction**

Diet plays a major role in directly affecting longevity by altering biochemical
constitution of cells and metabolic pathways or indirectly through interactions
with the genome. Plant and animal based food and food-derived biomolecules are
known to promote longevity. Animal and plant based dietary options are complex
and preferences are classified as vegan, ovo-lacto-vegetarian, pesco-vegetarian or
omnivore/non-vegetarian. The choice of plant and animal based diet is often based on
geographical location, availability, cost, religious views, traditional practises, health
status and age. Often vegetarian diets are cereal and legume based and in this chapter
we will discuss that the benefits derived from vegetarian diets are also accounted to
fresh fruits and vegetables. However availability and cost influence the addition of
fresh produce to the so called vegetarian diets. Animal diets are often enjoyed for
their taste and satisfaction and despite them being calorie laden and concentrated in
saturated fats, are often a source of essential amino acids, minerals and vitamins.
The role of diet on longevity is studied based on the effect of consumption of
dietary components on certain biomarkers of health and longevity. Most studies focus
on markers implicated in diseases such as cardiovascular, cancer, neurodegenerative
and common metabolic diseases such as diabetes known to reduce life span (Barnes
2015). However minor ailments and resulting low quality of life have an additive
effect on ageing. Plant based diets are known to be low in saturated fats thereby
playingacriticalroleinreductionofcardiovasculardiseasesinpeoplefollowingthese
diets. Common ailments such as scurvy can easily be prevented by including vitaminC rich plant based food products. On the flip side, vegan diets are known to de devoid
of vitamin B-12, deficiency of which is associated with stroke, Alzheimer’s disease,
vascular dementia, Parkinson’s disease and cognitive impairments. Ageing is often
accompanied with lowered level of digestive enzymes and higher incidences of food
intolerances. Thus transformation in dietary preferences from animal to plant or vice
versa as a result of age or sickness/deficiency is not uncommon. Lactose intolerant
individuals seldom derive benefits from dairy products and have to switch to plant
based alternatives just as individuals allergic to nuts such as cashews or almonds
cannot consume plant based dairy alternatives. In general, ageing is accompanied
with changes in microbiome along with reduced intestinal uptake of nutrients thus
affecting dietary preferences across age groups (Vemuri et al. 2018).
The focus of this chapter is to compare composition of animal- and plant-based
food and its effects on health, gut microbiome and ultimately human life span. It
will also review common food preparation methods and agricultural practises and
their role in altering biocomposition of select food items. The chapter concludes by
enlisting novel alternatives available such as 3-D printed food for the health conscious

consumers.

###### **8.2 Epidemiological Studies and Dietary Preferences**

An ideal diet should include safe, palatable, healthy and tasty food which can provide
health, mental satiety and longevity. Several reports show that people in various parts
of the world consume diets that enable them to live longer, e.g. Mediterranean diet and
Japanese diet. Mediterranean diet involve abundant plant-based food ingredients such
as fruits, vegetables, grains, beans, nuts, and olive oil seeds as the primary source of
fat. A study revealed that, adherence to Mediterranean diet improved the health status
ofindividualswithdecreaseinmortality(9%),mortalityfromcardiovasculardiseases
(9%), incidence of or mortality from cancer (6%), and incidence of Parkinson’s
disease and Alzheimer’s disease (13%) (Sofi et al. 2008). Likewise, longevity factor is
also observed in people living in Japanese island Okinawa. Health statistics show that
Okinawan’s have the longest documented life expectancy at 85.1 years for women
and 77.2 years for men. Centenarians in Okinawa number about 35 per 100,000
people compared with 5 to 10 among the same population in the United States.
There exists a variety of dietary patterns observed worldwide which are generally
based on availability of specific food (plants and animals) and is largely governed
by the geography, climate and environmental factors. Table 8.1 gives on overview of
different diets and their benefits. **8.3 Factors Affecting Bio-composition of Plant and Animal** **Food Sources**

For comparison of plant and animal diet and its effect on longevity it is imperative
to study the bio-composition of the dietary source. It has been widely reported that
the environment and use of specific agricultural and farming practises can affect the
produce either favourably or unfavourably. Environmental factors such as water, air
and soil can significantly affect the nutritional quality, safety and sensorial traits of the
food. Air, water andsoil arecontinuouslymonitoredandregulatorylimits for residues
and pollutants are well established by agencies such as environmental protection
[agency (http://www.epa.ie/pubs/reports/indicators/SoE_Report_2016.pdf). Despite](http://www.epa.ie/pubs/reports/indicators/SoE_Report_2016.pdf)
the limits, anthropogenic activities lead to pollutants such as gases (NH3, SO2,
CO, C6H6, volatile phenols), suspended particles (PM10 and PM2.5, Pb, Ni, Cd,
polyaromatic hydrocarbons) and ionizing radiation in air or chemicals (fertilizers &
pesticides/industrial dyes/heavy metals) in water & soil that can be toxic to animals
or plants (Gheorghe and Ion 2011). Toxic effects range from cancers in farm animal
to presence of residues in animals and plants which when consumed by humans
can be detrimental to their health and longevity. Agricultural practice followed for
cultivation and rearing of animals has a direct impact on the composition of the plant
and animal products. Thus grass fed cows produce nutritionally superior milk and
the products produced from such milk rank high in palatability as well as bio-actives.

on a rise. It has been demonstrated that caged hens undergo tremendous stress that
leads to production of stress hormones such as corticosterone in the hen which leads
to lower quality off-springs (Bulmer and Gil 2008; Kim et al. 2014). Several studies
have debated the nutritional superiority of caged versus range eggs. Few studies have
demonstrated higher levels of pigments in yolk of free range eggs and lower total
lipid content while other studies have shown higher microbial count on egg shells
from free range systems (Molnár and Szollosi 2020). Nutritional composition of
eggs and microbial contaminants will effect consumer health and hence selection
of the egg type needs consideration. Similarly hormone induced- milking practises
have detrimental effect on humans. Massive sales of organic produce demonstrate
preference of consumers towards residue free product.
Mass cultivation using pesticides and fertilizers not only affect the farming
community but the consumers at large. High percentage of cancers and other
long term ailments from exposure to pesticides affect human life directly and
needs cautious approach. Finally PUFA rich fish has been promoted as part of
several longevity promoting diets such as Japanese or Eskimo diets (Sugano and

Hirahara 2000; López and Ortega 2003). An important criteria here is farmed
fish versus wild caught. Often fish such as farmed catfish or tilapia have been
condemned for their high content of pro-inflammatory omega-6 content (Weaver
et al. 2008). On the other hand wild caught omega-3 rich mackerel, sardines and tuna
have a positive anti-inflammatory effect. European food safety authority (EFSA)
dictates caution on fish consumption by pregnant women as it is often a source
of heavy metals and thus despite its health benefits fish consumption needs to
be regulated (https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-provides-advice-safety-andnutritionalcontribution-wild-and-farmed-fish). A growing trend in aquaculture worth
mentioning is that of multitrophic aquaculture. Integrated salmon-seaweed culture
leads to utilization of salmon metabolic waste for the growth of seaweed (Fossberg et al. 2018). Such systems often result in high protein seaweed which are a rich
source of branched amino acids such as leucine, directly implicated in muscle growth
and prevention of sarcopenia in ageing population (Martínez-Arnau et al. 2020).
Thus agricultural practices followed and residue limits as determined through good
labelling practices and regulatory approvals help consumers select health promoting
dietary components while rejecting detrimental plant and animal food products.
###### **8.4 Plant and Animal Food for Longevity**

Though several epidemiological studies, dietary pattern analysis as well as controlled
feeding/intervention studies have explored the ever-lasting debate on plant versus
animal food, no conclusive merit can be given to one over the other. This is mainly
because any diet or intervention study starts with a hypothesis around a single food
item but in reality daily dietary recalls or interventions need to consider the macro
and micronutrient substitutions in the overall diet as well as the interaction of food

matrix with the nutrient under study. Studies that have implicated carbohydrates as
bad focus on refined sugars rather than complex carbohydrates, while the condemned
fat molecules are generally saturated fats and not polyunsaturated fats. Similarly
studies that compare animal and plant protein sources and their effect on metabolic
diseases often disregard the overall macromolecular composition and the type of
animalprotein.Forexamplethechoiceofagoodproteinsourceisnotbasedonanimal
or plant origin, rather it should provide the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of
protein which is 0.8 g protein/kg body weight of adults along with suppling RDA
for each essential amino acid ( *Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate,*
*Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids* 2005). The next section
will attempt to decipher the differential effect of animal and plant dietary components
on longevity.

*Plant Food*

Fruits and vegetables provide a powerful boost of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. High intake of fruits and vegetables have been associated with reduced risk

diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer etc. Studies reveal that many of the
phytonutrients in fruits and vegetables can both protect against and repair damage
to the body’s cells. E.g. Antioxidant quercetin found in onions and apples help
in preserving brain cells. Anthocyanins found in berries, grapes, pomegranate, red
onions, beans help to improve cholesterol and blood sugar levels and helps preventing
heart diseases (Cassidy et al. 2011). Dietary carotenoids such as lutein, zeaxanthin
found commonly in green leafy vegetables such as spinach, lettuce, pistachio nuts
reduce the risk and progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), leading
cause of blindness in old people (Eisenhauer et al. 2017). Soy protein has been implicated in reduction of cholesterol mainly due to the presence of phytosterols in soy
bean (Lin et al. 2004). Many other fibre rich plant protein sources have demonstrated
lipid binding & faecal elimination leading to cardio protective functionalities. Table
8.2 enumerates variety antioxidants available from plant and animal food and their
benefits.
Bonehealthisalsoanimportantfactorresponsibleforhealthyactivelife.Micronutrients such as vitamin K, folate, magnesium, potassium, calcium and antioxidants
such as vitamin C and carotenoids present in fruits and vegetables are useful for
healthy bones. Consumption of bone protecting foods such as broccoli, cabbage,
okra, prunes throughout life help to improve the indices of bone health (Higgs et al.
2017).Alongwithfruitsandvegetables,legumesalsohavebeenlinkedwithlongevity
food cultures such as the Japanese (soy, tofu, natto, miso), the Swedes (brown beans,

to ‘Food Habits in Later Life’ (FHILL) a cross-cultural study conducted by International Union of Nutritional Sciences (IUNS) and the World Health Organization
(WHO) reveal that for every 20 g increase in daily legumes intake there was an
8% reduction in the risk of death. Thus suggesting that higher legume intake is the
most protective dietary predictor of survival amongst the elderly, regardless of their
ethnicity (Darmadi-Blackberry et al. 2004).

*Animal Food*

Dairy products are rich in minerals (calcium, potassium, and magnesium), protein
(casein and whey), and vitamins (riboflavin and vitamin B-12). In dietary guidelines, dairy products, including full or specifically low fat milk, are recommended
as sources of protein and calcium for bone health, and in some diets as prevention
against hypertension. However studies show that the proposed benefits of milk for
bone health are not clear and controversial. A cohort studies in men and women

carried out by Michaëlsson et al. 2014 showed that higher milk intake is associated
with higher mortality. However this was not observed with fermented dairy products such as yoghurt and cheese. Recent study by Tucker 2019, also reported that
consumption of high fat milk increased biological aging. Accordingly latest Dietary
Guidelines for Americans (2015–2020) recommend consumption of low-fat milk as
part of a healthy diet instead of high fat milk.
Eggs are rich source for high biological value protein, as well as vitamins and
minerals such as folic acid, vitamin B12, vitamins E and D, selenium, choline, zinc,
etc. About 50% of the fat in the egg is MUFA. However, because of the high saturated

cholesterolisassociatedwithhighbloodcholesterollevelsandcardiovasculardisease
(Kritchevsky and Kritchevsky 2000). But studies revealed that dietary cholesterol
in general and cholesterol in eggs in particular have limited effects on the blood
cholesterol level and on cardiovascular disease (Jones 2009).
Fish is a rich source of high-quality proteins, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
(PUFAs), and other nutrients, such as minerals, trace elements, and vitamins (Hosomi
et al. 2012). Epidemiologic evidence shows relationship between vitamin D deficiency and various age related and chronic diseases such as autoimmune disease,
cancer, cardiovascular disease, depression, dementia, infectious diseases, musculoskeletal and bone health. A diet high in oily fish such as salmon, mackeral, sardines,
tuna help in preventing vitamin D deficiency. Omega-3 [(n − 3)] fatty acids are known
to be associated to healthy aging throughout life. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and

docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) found
abundantly in animal food e.g. fish, fish oil supplements, while alpha-linolenic acid
(ALA) another omega -3 fatty acid is found in plant food such as nuts and seeds.
These fatty acids show a wide array of health benefits in prevention of cardiovascular disease, cancer and metabolic syndrome (Sugawara et al. 2013). Of these, EPA
and DHA are essential for proper foetal development and healthy aging (Dunstan
et al. 2007). However, some studies have reported contradictory results. Tsuduki
et al. 2011 demonstrated that administration of fish oil containing high levels of
EPA and DHA to senescence-accelerated mice P8 (SAMP8) shortened their lifespan
significantly. However further studies on *C. elegans* showed that large amounts of
fish oil significantly reduced the lifespan of *C. elegans* but an appropriate amount
of fish oil extended their lifespan significantly (Sugawara et al. 2013). In line with
this Champigny et al. 2018 also observed increase in lifespan of Drosophilia fed
with diets supplemented with EPA and DHA. Recently a cohort study revealed that
higher levels of circulating omega-3 from seafood, especially EPA, is associated with

healthy aging (Lai et al. 2018). Further research needs to be carried out in humans
to assess various clinical outcomes.

Meat which includes unprocessed red meat (such as beef, pork and lamb), unprocessed white meat (such as chicken, turkey and poultry) are among the best dietary
sources of high quality protein. Red meat contains essential micronutrients such as
iron, zinc, selenium, potassium, and range of B vitamins including thiamin, niacin,
riboflavin, pantothenic acid, and vitamins B6 and B12. For those who consume
little or no oily fish, meat also helps in contributing long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Large number of studies have shown that consumption of red and
processed meat is associated with increase in total mortality, whereas low meat intake
is associated with greater longevity (Singh et al. 2003; Virtanen et al. 2019). Meat
rich in branched chain amino acids that promote muscle synthesis are particularly
beneficial to ageing populations showing signs of sarcopenia while vegan diets low
in essential amino acids such as lysine, isoleucine, tryptophan need dairy or animal
protein supplementation. However current research shows conflicting results not in
favour of dietary advice to limiting unprocessed red meat (Micha et al. 2010; Binnie
et al. 2014). Fresh lean cuts differ dramatically in their composition when compared
to processed cured meat. Processed meat contains 400% more sodium and 50% more
nitrates than unprocessed meat hence a critical risk to health. A systematic review
has concluded that processed red meat is associated with 42% greater risk of CHD
but the key word being ‘processed’ and not just red meat (Micha et al. 2010). The ill
effects of red meat are often attributed to saturated fat and cholesterol or to advanced

glycation and lipid oxidation products. Lean meat rich in branched amino acids and
bio-actives has been accorded health benefits in contrast to sodium and nitrates laden
cured meat. Having said that recent studies on dry cured ham as a source of bioactive
peptides has completely spun the narrative (Gallego et al. 2019).
Thus the studies show that both animal and plant sources have molecules of health
benefits but unless we have data of purified food fractions with known molecular
compositions and inter-molecular interactions, the results need cautious interpretations. Nutritional experts and related organizations, such as the U.S. Department
of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services of the Spanish
Society of Community Nutrition (SENC), recommend an increased consumption of
fruits and vegetables, grains, legumes, low-fat dairy products, lean meats and fish,
especially fatty fish species that are high in n-3 PUFA for healthy life. Thus we can
say consumption of minimally processed plant and animal food is equally important
in providing health benefits in individual. Further, bio-accessibility and bioavailability of biomolecules from these foods have to be studied which plays a crucial
role to exert beneficial health effect.

###### **8.5 Effect of Plant and Animal Source Diet on Health** **Through Gut Microbiota**

Human digestive system sequentially involves physical, biochemical and fermentation processes. Although the first few steps vary in a narrow range for most human
beings, the fermentation in large intestine could be quite diverse in different subjects.
Scientific research has established the importance of interplay between consumed
food, gut microbiota and health. In fact, gut microbiota plays a central role in between
food and human health. A schematic representation shown in Fig. 8.1 showcases
different dietary sources and their effect on gut microbiome and health.
Human gut contains trillions of microorganisms with a variety of species showing
dominance of *Actinobacteria* and *Proteobacteria* phyla in neonates whereas *Firmi-*
*cutes* and *Bacteroidetes* in healthy adult (Eckburg et al. 2005). Major functions of
gut microbiota are defending body from pathogens, modifying absorption of nutrients and producing vitamins. According to some studies there are similarities in the
gut microbiota of healthy individuals but these are highly influenced by external
factors like environment and diet (Conlon and Bird 2015) and a balanced microbiota
is important for human longevity.

**Fig. 8.1** Schematic highlights interplay of gut microbiome with plant and animal foods and their
effect on health


-----

168 A. S. Naik et al.

Many researchers have attempted to decipher the effect of plant based diet on gut
microbiome and human health. Broccoli has glucosinolates which reduces *Lacto-*
*bacillus, Enterococcus and Clostridium perfringens* which helps in reduction of
colonic inflammation (Raskin et al. 2002). Martinez showed diets rich in brown
rice and barley increase the count of *Eubacterium rectale* which in turn increases
the insulin response (Martínez et al. 2013). Cereal grains like sorghum, oat, rice,
corn, wheat and barley rich in starch and xylan are digested by *Bifidobacterium,*
*Ruminococcus* and *Roseburia* to produce essential defence elements SCFAs such
as butyrate, acetate and propionate (Scott et al. 2013). Butyrate reduces propensity
towards cardiovascular diseases and cancers (Wong et al. 2006). Another important
disorder to focus on is obesity, known to impact quality of life. Dietary patterns
effect composition of gut microbiome which in turn have profound effect on underlying mechanism that leads to obesity. Diet rich in high fibre and low fat such as
spinach, tomato, seeds, broccoli, artichokes etc. helps to increase *Bifidobacteria* and
*Lactobacilli* which tend to found at higher levels in healthy individuals compared
to obese individuals. In contrary high fat and low fibre foods like processed juices,
fried chips increases Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes which are directly linked to enhanced
occurrence of obesity (Anhê et al. 2015). It was found that diet rich with cranberry
extract increases *Akkermansia* species that help in controlling obesity.
Animal based food also plays an important role in gut microbiota composition and
health. Some of the important nutrients like Vitamin B12 & D3 and DHA are absent
in plant based diet and can be naturally obtained only through animal-food intake.
Consumption of animal-based food increases bile acid-tolerant microorganisms such
as *Bacteroides, Alistipes* which help in absorption of lipo-soluble nutrients (David
et al. 2014). Fish oil increases the probiotic microbes metabolic profile thereby having
detrimental effect on obesity. Animal derived food is a major source of protein and
amino acids which are often used as energy source by microbes when the diet is
limiting in carbohydrates. Red meat has Tryptophan that is converted to indole by
commensal bacteria *Lactobacillus*, which in turn helps in production of immune
cytokine IL-22. Another example is egg yolks, meat liver and fish that are known to
be rich in vitamin D, which increases the overall diversity of gut microbiome and
it was found that good health is associated with diverse microbiota. Scientists have
found that active vitamin D is critical in maintaining increased levels of Bacteroidetes
thereby promoting health and reducing risk for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.
Fermented foods play a major role in skin health, as consumption of fermented
milkhelpstoincreaseBifidobacteriumleadingtoreductionofphenolanditsilleffects
on skin (Miyazaki et al. 2014). Fermented foods also help in increased production
of SCFAs such as butyrate. Kefir is a probiotic product that has kefir grains made of
beneficial yeast and bacteria that promote bone health. Tempeh is another fermented
food made of soybeans rich in protein known to reduce risk of heart disease by
lowering LDL level. Daily consumption of yoghurt rich in live *lactobacilli* is a
regular dietary habit in Indian subcontinent. Further, particularly in southern part
of India known for its hot tropical climate (unsuitable for growth of lactobacilli),


-----

8 Animal- and Plant-Based Food for Health and Longevity 169

daily consumption of gourd family vegetables is common and Sreenivas and Lele
(2013) have reported these vegetables to possess prebiotic properties especially ash
gourd ( *Benincasa Hispida* ). Palamthodi and Lele (2014) have shown nutraceutical
effects of some important gourds that are regularly consumed in India. Food additives
such as non-caloric sweeteners alter gut microbiota by changing *Bacteroidetes* to
*Firmicutes* and there by increases the chance of glucose intolerance and insulin
resistance which has indirect effect of diabetes and obesity (Suez et al. 2014). Thus
eliminationofdietarycomponentsthathaveadverseeffectonhealthygutmicrobiome
and incorporation of probiotic and prebiotic plant and animal derived fermented food
will promote health and longevity.
###### **8.6 Healthy Food Preparation Practises and the Associated** **Risk/Benefits**

While discussing the benefits and risks of various food groups, people often neglect
the major role food preparation methods play in the final nutritional quality of a
culinary preparation. Raw food in the form of vegetables, unpasteurized milk, fish
(sushi) is consumed by many but consumption of cooked packaged food far exceeds
raw consumption. Since the discovery of fire by the caveman and progress in the
field of food processing and culinary sciences, novel processed products and innovative recipes have evolved. With advancement of science and communications
the world is becoming flat and many food preparations are now used across the
globe and geographical barriers have disappeared. Many consumers seek minimally
processed or raw food. However, despite sushi and sashimi offering health benefits of PUFAs, pathogenic bacteria and parasites present in raw fish pose a potent
health risk to connoisseurs (Muscolino et al. 2014). Consumption of raw vegetables if grown under unhygienic conditions of soil and water have risk of *E.coli*
infections. Unpasteurized milk is known for bio-actives, enzymes and for promoting
growth of lactobacillus in gut however needs to be carefully monitored for microbial loads and food safety precautions (Butler et al. 2020). Cooking methods such
as blanching, steaming, roasting or using microwave to cook food is often associated with reduction in antinutrients like tannins, saponins, oxalates while preserving
natural pigments and nutrients in the food. For example microwave cooking is associated with increased levels of Sulforaphane, an anti-cancer bioactive produced by
hydrolysis of glucoraphanin in broccoli when compared to raw counterpart (Lu
et al. 2020). Similarly sprouting of seeds and fermentation of plant and animal food
products is often association with increased digestibility and enhanced bioactivities.
Sprouts (lentils, flaxseed) and microgreens (kale, amaranth) have been labelled as
superfoods that showcase several bioactivities including anti-diabetic and anticholinergic activity (Wojdylo et al. 2007). Fermented cabbage or ‘kimchi’, a plant based
product has been reported to have anti-cancer, anti-oxidant, anti-obesity and antiageing properties amongst others (Park et al. 2014). On the other hand, bioactive


-----

170 A. S. Naik et al.

peptides derived from *lactobacillus plantarum* fermented milk have been reported
to possess the anti-inflammatory, antihaemolytic, antioxidant, antimutagenic, and
antimicrobial activities (Aguilar-Toalá et al. 2017).
Deep frying of food at high temperatures is often associated with formation of
acrylamide (Yang et al. 2016). Thus vegetables consumed in the form of fried fritters
have high content of cancer causing acrylamide and beats the purpose of incorporating health promoting vegetables in the daily diet. Similarly mashed potatoes as
the preferred carbohydrate source are better than a portion of potato chips despite
the starting ingredient being the same humble potato. Meat products have several
essential nutrients and are a source of essential amino acids, however the cooking
method plays a major role in the projected health benefits. Barbecued meat is a source
of nitrosamines while cured meat is rich in nitrates and nitrites all three implicated
as cancer causing agents (Song et al. 2015). Acrylamide, nitrosamines, nitrites and
anti-nutrients impact health negatively thereby affecting life span of the consumers.
Food preparation is often accompanied with utilization of add on ingredients to
enhance taste, preserve food as well as aid in cooking. Spices, enzymes and extracts
have been used for the mentioned purposes with some additional health promoting
effects. Red meat is often tenderized using enzymes such as papain, bromelain,
ficin to reduce cooking times and improve eating qualities. Often as a result of
tenderization, proteins in the meat are hydrolysed into bioactive peptides with health
benefits such as (ACE) inhibitory activity and antioxidant, lipid-lowering, antithrombotic and antimicrobial properties that can be incorporated in functional foods (Wu
et al. 2015). Natural fermented sauces such as soy sauce or fish sauce are a source
of many such bio-actives peptides that are often heat resistant and impart health
benefits to the consumers. Spices form a major group of ingredients often added to
food preparations in many Asian cuisines. Spices are preservative in nature due to
anti-microbial molecules but also have several active ingredients that are known to
be health promoting. Curcumin in turmeric, crocin and safranal in saffron, allicin in
garlic, eugenol in cloves, carnosic acid in rosemary, piperine in black pepper, thymoquinone in cumin, cineole in cardamom, gingerols in ginger are few bio-actives worth
mentioning for their innumerable health effects (Embuscado 2019). Spices are used
in vegetarian and non-vegetarian preparations including savoury and sweet dishes.
Thus the molecular composition of plant and animal food, the cooking method and
the composition of added ingredients determine the final quality and benefit of the
food items as shown in Table 8.3. Food labelling takes consideration of these factors
and hence the list of ingredients as well as percent composition of essential nutrients
is listed on packaged food products.

ples where processing tries to combine multiple health benefits. There is a need for
developing hybrid food products that have blended ingredients from plant and animal
sources. Novel food processing technologies such as 3-D printing, high moisture
extrusion, fermentation and cell culture are being employed for manufacturing meat

analogues or animal free cultured meat. Isolated purified ingredients from animal and
plant source are used, for instance plant derived proteins or polysaccharides as scaffolds for culturing meat (Ben-Arye and Levenberg 2019) or blended proteins such
as soy, pea, oats and others for manufacturing extruded meat analogues or texturized
vegetable protein (De Angelis et al. 2020). Another example would be 3-D printing
nutritionally superior meat products derived from high quality protein ingredients
derived from in vitro cell culture, meat by-products/waste, insects and plants devoid
of saturated fats while demonstrating enhanced sensorial traits (Ramachandraiah
2021). Specialised textured meat is aimed at geriatric population to overcome their
problems associated with consumption of tough meat and tenderization procedures
aid in supplementing the diets of old people(Dick et al. 2019). Most of the processing
technologies require ingredients that support the techno-functional properties of the
meat product. Plant derived hydrocolloids provide functionality such as emulsion
stability, viscosity, and gelation to ingredients. Meat analogues also require pigmentation or inks that paint the meat red or pink and provide the meat like aesthetics.
Seaweed and fungi derived pigments or vegetable derived inks such as beetroot ink
can be employed to manufacture faux meat. Quorn a fungi-derived mycoprotein rich
in essential amino acids and fibre has been reported to support post exercise recovery
better than milk protein (Monteyne et al. 2020). Thus, in our search for more sustainable and nutritionally superior protein sources, the trend shifts towards incorporation
of low carbon food ingredients such as algae, fungi and insects for manufacturing
functional food products aimed at promoting longevity.
###### **8.8 Concluding Remarks**

Food, life style, environmental factors, genetic constitution, gut microbiome are some
of the important parameters that have significant impact on human longevity – a long
healthy life. Food is one of the most prominent factors that could be easily managed
for good health. Human digestion system works like a series of bioreactors and
quality, quantity and frequency of meals in a day impacts the performance. Digestion and retrieval of nutrients from food is altered with age as a result of changes
in expression of digestive enzymes as well as microbiome composition. Research
shows that both plant and animal food can have beneficial as well as adverse health
effects. Based on epidemiological studies, dietary interventions, in both in vitro and
invivostudieshavereportedthatseveralplantandanimalfoodproductssuchasfruits,
vegetables, dairy products, fresh fish and meat retard ageing through action of antioxidants, minerals, proteins, peptides, polyunsaturated fatty acids and other functional
molecules. To obtain maximum benefit and minimise adverse effects, recommended
daily allowances, food preparation practises and farming and agricultural methods
need to be revisited before indulging in anti-ageing diets. Sudden drastic change in
diet by inclusion of newer foods or exclusion of regular foods, may lead to developing allergies and perturbed microbiota. Interactions between bio-molecules such
as dietary fat and beta-carotene or phytates and minerals resulting in synergistic or


-----

antagonistic effects requires more exploration. Extreme caution needs to be followed
in extending benefits derived from whole food such as ‘catechins in tea’ to purified
concentrated supplements such as green tea extract (GTE) that may alter metabolic
pathways to a much greater extent.

##### **Chapter 9**
#### **Fermented Foods in Aging and Longevity**

**S. Heeba and P. Nisha**

**Abstract** Fermented foods have been in the human diet for thousands of years
because of their nutritive, preservative, and organoleptic properties. Recently,
fermented foods gained more attention among people due to the functional microbes,
which possess antioxidant, antimicrobial, probiotics, peptide production properties
etc., thereby modulating specific actions in the human body related to healthy aging
and longevity. Growing evidence suggests that fermented foods change the metabolic
activitiesinthegut,acquirenewcharacteristics,andincreasebenefitinage-associated
changes. Gut microbiota and the brain maintain bidirectional communication and
modulate behavior via the “microbiota-gut-brain axis” in the human body. A series
of relevant benefits associated with fermented foods in healthy aging and longevity
have been reported that includes preventing allergic reactions, gastrointestinal disorders, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, obesity, improving metabolic function
and neuroendocrine effects, etc. Therefore, the ultimate way for longevity may be
obtained by healthy lifestyle habits that comprise a healthy diet inclusive of various
fermentedfoods.Thischapterfocusesonreviewsandcriticalanalysisofpast,current,
and future research of fermented foods in aging and longevity.

Fermented foods are evolved from an ancient food processing and preservation
technique known as fermentation. Around one-third of the human population’s diet
consists of foods that are fermented and are consumed by people of various cultures S. Heeba · P. Nisha ( B )

and lifestyles around the world (Carvalho et al. 2018). Existing scientific data show
that functional microorganisms convert the chemical constituents of raw materials
of food to beneficial metabolites during fermentation. Thereby, fermented foods
promote the bio-availability of nutrients, improve organoleptic properties, impart
bio-preservation and food safety, eliminate toxic components, develop antimicrobial
and antioxidant compounds, induces probiotic activities, and thus modulate specific
actions in the human body (Tamang et al. 2016). Fermented foods have gained attention, and the term probiotics was introduced in 1907, after assessing the importance of
fermented milk on longevity by the Nobel Prize Laureate Elie Metchnikoff (Anukam
and Reid 2007). Various studies reported that the consumption of fermented foods
prevents cardiovascular diseases, cancer, gastrointestinal disorders, allergic reactions, diabetes and obesity (Tamang et al. 2016). Emerging evidence has shown a
link between nutrition, diet, probiotics, and fermented foods for the human body’s
vital functions from the immune system to mental stability (Kim et al. 2016).
Aging refers to gradual changes in the dynamics of biological, behavioral, environmental, and social processes. It involves a gradual decline in the immune system,
resulting in an imbalance between anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory activity
(Das et al. 2020). Fermented foods enrich microbes residing in the gut known as
gut microbiota, which is essential for health and helps to maintain many brain and
immune functions. Emerging evidence suggests that the gut micro biota plays a
major role in age-associated diseases (Badal et al. 2020). Therefore, the best way
for longevity may be to adopt healthy lifestyle habits comprised of healthy diet
and fermented foods. The present chapter provides a comprehensive review on the
available literature the regarding the role of fermented foods in aging and longevity.
###### **9.2 Microbes Involved in Food Fermentation**

Several microorganisms are present in foods. The majority of them are associated
with spoilage of food and toxin production, but a group of microorganisms are
involved in enhancing food quality, nutrition, and also act as a natural preservative
(Ray and Joshi 2014). Bacteria, yeasts, and mould are the common microbes involved
in fermentation. Lactic acid bacteria like lactobacillus, streptococcus, oenococcus,
pediococcus, and acetobacter species present in the food oxidize alcohol into acetic
acid useful for vinegar production. Beneficial yeast like *S.cerevisiae* plays an important role in bread making and alcohol production. Schizosaccharomyces boulderi and
*S. Pombe* areyeasttypes present in millet responsible for fermented beverage production (Joshi et al. 2011). Moulds like Penicillium species in some food products help
in flavour development, such as cheese processing (Battcock and Azam-Ali 1998).
Fermentation takes place in two ways. “Wild ferments” fermentation occurs naturally
in the raw material or due to the environment, such as kimchi, sauerkraut. “Culturedependent ferments” happen when a starter culture is added externally, for example,
kefir. Another method is back slopping, in which some amount of already fermented
batch is added to the raw material, for example, vinegar (Parker et al. 2018).

###### **9.3 Mechanism Behind Fermented Foods in Health** **and Longevity**

The gut microbiota plays a significant role in the human body by communicating
betweenthegutandbrainandmodulatethebehaviourviathe“gut-brainaxis”through
hormonal, neural, and immune mediators (Cryan and Dinan 2012). Short-chain fatty
acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate, propionate, acetate, etc., formed by fermentation
of prebiotics by gut microbiota, inhibit the growth of many harmful microbes by
lowering pH. It also promotes mineral absorption, metabolism of glucose and lipids,
stimulate proliferation and differentiation of intestinal enterocytes. In addition to this,
SCFAs were reported to have positive impact on central nervous system functions
(Rowland et al. 2018). The SCFAs stimulate the secretion of GLP-1, which inhibits
glucagon secretion, modulates insulin secretion, improves insulin sensitivity and
decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis. Probiotics form intestinal barrier, which inhibits
absorption of antigens to prevent damage to β cells. Strong evidence is available in
literature about the gut microbiota being at the core of several age-associated changes
(Bana and Cabreiro 2019).
During the fermentation process, the phytochemicals present in food are altered
by the resident gut microbiota, which further inhibit the hypothalamic–pituitary–
adrenal axis and regulate neurotransmitters activity and thereby maintain mental
health (Cryan and Dinan 2012). Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is naturally
produced by microbes, plants, and mammals, mostly present in a wide variety
of foods. During fermentation, L-glutamate undergoes decarboxylation using the
enzyme bacterial glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) and produce GABA. Increasing
GABA content significantly inhibits excitatory neurotransmitters in the nervous
system and promotes many physiological functions of the body (Gan et al. 2017).
A pictorial representation of the mechanism behind fermented foods in the human
body are presented in Fig. 9.1.
A weak immune system is one of the signs of aging. The antioxidant defence
system of the body also becomes weak with aging due to which there is an increased
accumulation of reactive oxygen species in the body leading to DNA damage.
Fermentation metabolites present in many of the fermented foods (e.g. SCFAs)
as well as the phytochemicals (e.g. wines) are reported to enhance the expression
of immune players such as cytokines (interleukins- IL-6, IL-10, IL-12,and IL-1 β)
and immunoglobulins (IgA, and IgG) thus help in health and longevity (Das et al.
2020). The production of antihypertensive peptides through proteolytic action during
fermentation is reported to delay aging by modulating microflora in the gut thus
improving immune response (Hsieh et al. 2015).

###### **9.4 Types of Fermented Foods**

Wide varieties of fermented foods are produced using fermentation technology that
has changed from ancient practices and empirical science to industrial processes
and life science-driven technologies. Fermented foods can be broadly divided into
dairy-based fermented foods, meat-based fermented foods, fruit and vegetablebased fermented foods, cereal/pulse-based fermented foods, and miscellaneous
fermented foods. Some of the health benefits of different types of fermented foods
are summarized in the Table 9.1. ***9.4.1 Dairy-Based Fermented Foods***

Fermented dairy foods produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) by milk fermentation show a broad area of health benefits for longevity, such as the production of
antihypertensive peptides through proteolytic action, modulate microflora in the gut,
improve immune response thus delaying aging (Hsieh et al. 2015).
Yogurtisacoagulatedmilkproductformedbyfermentationusingstartercultureof
*Lactobacillus bulgaricus* and *Streptococcus thermophilus* . Lactic acid fermentation
results in folate production, increased protein content and digestibility, conjugated
linoleic acid content, and calcium absorption. This further helps to restore gut microbiota and stimulates immune functions that decline during the process of aging (Eales
et al. 2015). On the other hand, controversy still exists to prove the health benefits
of yogurt through clinical trials.

Increasing evidence of the benefits of fermented milk is reported through in vivo
and in vitro studies. Shida et al. (2017) established the potential benefits of fermented
foods and showed beneficial effects against infections in the upper respiratory tract.
Similarly, Yang et al. (2008) reported improvement in constipation in adult Chinese
women after consumption of fermented milk with probiotic strain yogurt starters
(Streptococcus thermophilus, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus; 1.2 × 109 CFU
per day) and Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173010 1.25 × 1010 CFU per day). Ishida
et al. (2005) reported improved condition of a group of people in Japan with cedar
pollen allergy and ocular symptoms medication scores after the consumption of Lb.
acidophilus L-92 mediated fermented milk. Some other studies have also established
the positive role of fermented milk against cardiovascular diseases, treatment of
metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and modulating effects of
adipocytes (Saez-Lara et al. 2015).
Mor kuzhambhu, a traditional recipe prepared in South Indian food, showed an
excellent antibacterial response against pathogens L.monocytogenes and Salmonella
typhi, which causes foodborne illness (Satish et al. 2013). Dadih, fermented milk
from buffalo, is kept for 48 h in bamboo tubes and covered by banana leaves for
fermentation to obtain yogurt-like texture in Indonesia. It was reported that Lc. lactis
subsp. lactis IS 10,285 cultured Dadih reduces cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolemic rats due to its ability to colonize in the gut. However, Lc. lactissubsp.lactis
IS 2986 did not normalize cholesterol levels in *invivo* studies because of its inactivity
in the gut (Pato et al. 2004). Hence the benefits of specific strains need to be explored
for promoting health and longevity. Studies on cheese showed that it is enriched with
conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) which protects against atherosclerotic conditions
and many other diseases (Hur et al. 2017). Koumiss, a raw mare’s milk product from
central and west Asia demonstrated a positive effect on endocrine glands, immune,
nervous, cardiovascular systems, kidneys, liver, avitaminosis, gastric, and intestinal
diseases (Rong et al. 2015).
###### ***9.4.2 Meat-Based Fermented Foods***

LAB play a crucial function in the fermentation of meat by producing bacteriocins
and adjusting optimum pH as well as protecting from the development of spoilage
and pathogenic microorganisms, thereby providing safety, shelf life, and stability to
fermented meat products (Dincer and Kivanc 2012).
LAB strains present in fermented fishes such as Tungtap, Hentak, and Ngari
show better antibacterial effects, presence of proteolytic enzymes, and absence of
biogenic amines (Satish et al. 2013). Sucuk, is a traditional Turkish fermented meat
product prepared by adding a starter culture to the meat. Different combinations of
microbes were used during sucuk processing, which provided many physicochemical, microbial, and biochemical properties in addition to its organoleptic properties
Thapa et al. (2004). Several reports in literature provide evidence that meat fermented
products as a probiotic starter culture carrier is increased due to its activities such as


-----

186 S. Heeba and P. Nisha

ACE-inhibition and inhibition of fatty acid oxidation and proteolytic action, and it
also prevents the growth of spoilage microbes that produce biogenic amines peptide
(Ichimura et al. 2003). In contrast, some nutritionists criticize its high fat, biogenic
amines, salt content, and possibilities of infection (Kjeldgaard et al. 2012). Deniz
et al. (2016) Reported that Pastırma, a traditional semi-fermented meat product most
popularly consumed by Turkish people, exhibits ACE inhibitory and anti-oxidant
properties, which further helpto slow down the process of aging.It is reported that
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are present in higher
amounts in fermented products such as fermented fish oil as compared to natural
fish oil (Han et al. 2012). Ichimura et al. (2003) reported that fermented fish sauce
has the potential to stimulate insulin secretion, which combats diabetes by bringing
down hypertension by producing ACE-inhibitory peptides. Some fermented fish oil
has a large amount of Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which can prevent an
allergic reaction in the human body (Han et al. 2012).
###### ***9.4.3 Cereal/Pulse-Based Fermented Foods***

Short-chain fatty acids are produced in the large intestine during Cereals and legumes
fermentation, forming an acidic environment in the gut that further multiplies lactic
microbiota (Roopashri and Vardaraj 2009). Some anti aging-associated characteristics of fermented foods are reported in Table 9.2. Wide varieties of fermented cereals
and legumes are consumed all over the globe every day, but their benefits for healthy
aging and longevity are still not clear.
In most of the southern part of India, fermented cereal foods such as dosa, koozhu,
pazhaiya soru (Fermented rice), idli, and ambali are taken regularly by locals (Nisha
et al. 2005). Moreover, these foods are reported to have a higher amount of probiotics (Satish et al. 2013). Pal et al. (2005) reported that LAB isolated from dosa
inhibited pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, V. parahaemolyticus,
and the antibacterial activity was attributed to protein bacteriocins. Kefir, fermented
milk produced from kefir grains during acid-alcoholic fermentation, was shown to
have anti-hypertensive, hypocholesterolemic, anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory antimutagenic, anti-allergenic, anti carcinogenic, anti-diabetic, anti-oxidant activity, and
alsoprobioticeffectsintheimmunesystem(Kesenkaetal. 2013).Fermentedlegumes
demonstrate anti-diabetic properties bymodifying the enzymes such as amylase,
glucosidase, and acetylcholinesterase, during fermentation (Ademiluyi et al. 2015).
Higher amount of ferulic acid was produced by fermented rice bran as compared to
normal rice bran, which further improves health by reducing oxidative stress (Kim
and Han 2011). Intake of fermented red rice is reported to reduce the level of cholesterol and oxidative stress-induced DNA damage (Kong et al. 2015). Ekinci et al.
(2016) reported that Shalgam juice, a non-alcoholic beverage prepared by fermentation, is rich in probiotics, anti-oxidant, anti-proliferative properties, and also has a
protective effect on colon cancer.

its anti-oxidative, vasodilatory, anti-mutagenic, probiotic, probiotic and anti-diabetic
properties (SanJose et al. 2017). But the excessive consumption of beer may be
harmful and leads to severe health issues (De Gaetano et al. 2016). During fermentation of sourdough, ACE-inhibitory peptides were produced, which further reduced
the glycemic index and increased mineral availability in bread (Novotni et al. 2012).
Intake of red wine in a particular amount also plays a role in the immune system
and acts as an anti-aging agent (Magrone et al. 2008). Seo et al. (2009) reported that
wine prepared from rice showed higher intracellular antioxidant capacity in human
fibroblasts and keratinocytes. As observed from the literature, red.
yeast rice (produced by fermenting yeast over the rice) has cholesterol lowering
effect in people affected with mildly hypercholesterolemic patients (Cicero et al.
2017). Nuruk, an alcoholic beverage prepared in Korea with several starters,
possesses ABT Scavenging activity and produces Superoxide dismutase activity in

H 2 O 2 -treatedHepG2 cells (Lee et al. 2012). Rats fed with Chung kookjang, a Korean
soybean fermented paste, has higher antioxidant potential (Kwak et al. 2007). GABA
content of edible seeds such as soybean, faba bean, wheat, millet, rye, and quinoa
is reported to increase during lactic acid fermentation (Gan et al. 2017). GABA
plays a critical role in the regulation of blood pressure and many other physiological
functions of the body.
###### ***9.4.4 Fruit and Vegetable-Based Fermented Foods***

Fruits and vegetables are rich in naturally occurring bioactive compounds that have
been identified having anti-aging effects through many in in-vivo and in-vitro studies.
The microorganism in fermented fruits and vegetables help to prevent some diseases
such as diarrhoea and cirrhosis and, also antioxidants may help to eliminate harmful
free radicals that play a significant role in degenerative diseases (Swain et al. 2014).
Kimchi, fermented vegetables contain some species such as Leuconostoc, Weissella, and Lactobacillus during fermentation. Some health benefits are reported which
including anti mutagenic and anticancer activities, constipation prevention, improvement of the immune system functions, and aging process (Patra et al. 2016). The
effects of kimchi’s anti-aging properties have been reported to reduce HT-29 human
colon carcinoma cells by increasing the protein production and mRNA factors
that could promote cell apoptosis and arrest the carcinoma cells during the cell
cycle (Yu et al. 2020). Fermented olives, a rich source of probiotics, is reported to
prevent cancer, allergic reaction, modulate immune system, and aid digestion (Peres
et al. 2017). Sauerkraut (fermented vegetables) contains a high amount of vitamins,
phenolic compounds, and minerals like calcium, iron, potassium, and phosphorus,
and is reported to possess positive effect against carcinogens, inflammation, and
reactive oxygen production (Penaset al. 2017). Acetic acid formed during vinegar
production can inhibit body fat and hepatic lipid accumulation without changing
skeletal muscle weight and food intake (Kondo et al. 2009). ***9.4.5 Miscellaneous Fermented Products***

Kombucha, a fermented tea product from northeast China promotes liver function,
prevent cardiovascular diseases, various types of cancers and stimulates immune
system which may be correlated with the healthy aging of this population (Jayabalan
et al. 2014). Pulque, a Mexican alcoholic fermented beverage made from the cactus
plant, was found to be rich in amino acids, vitamin B, and iron content during fermentation and also reported to have many health benefits. Gari, chickwanghe, fufu, lafun,
agbelima, attieke, and kivunde are some of the fermented food products prepared
from cassava roots in African countries, sochu an alcoholic beverage produced in

Japan from fermented sweet potatoes, are also reported for their functional properties
(Ray and Sivakumar 2009).
###### **9.5 Risk of Fermented Foods**

Naturally fermented foods if not sterilized properly can have the risk of presence
of pathogenic microbes. Production of toxic and harmful substances during fermentation is another risk factor associated with fermented foods. Biogenic amines are
also a significant risk associated with fermented foods. However, consumption of
fermented foods with an elevated amount of biogenic amines (>100 mg/kg) alters
the detoxification system and are a cause of concern for health (Alvarez and Arribas
2014). Ethyl carbamate (urethane) is formed in fermented foods mostly in fermented
alcoholic beverages and is considered as a possible cancer causing substance and
has probable health risk for people regularly consuming alcoholic beverages (Gowd
et al. 2018). **9.6 Future Prospects of Fermented Foods**

Emerging technology for food processing may help to modify substrate, alter the
fermentation process, apply particular stress to microbial load for fine tuning their
beneficial effects to enhance the production of a wide variety of fermented products in
the future. The use of innovative technologies for food fermentation at the industrial
level is still new. Some researchers are focusing on developing new culture strains
to improve the health benefits of fermented foods during fermentation. Advances in
metabolic engineering, synthetic biology, and other genetic engineering tools have
givenhopetoalterthemicrobialgenomeandthusmodifysomedesirablepropertiesof
the starter cultures during fermentation (Terefe and Augustin 2020). In this advanced
era, with the keen interest of food processing technologists and microbiologists, the
scope for developing new products through fermentation technology with confirmed
health benefits are tremendous that may help to combat aging and associated health
problems. **9.7 Conclusion**

Nowadays,increasingawarenessaboutfermentedfoodsattractsconsumerstoinclude
more fermented food products in their daily diet. This chapter’s primary intent was to
review the mechanisms of potential benefits of fermented food for healthy aging and
longevity. Consumption of fermented foods in the diet along with moderate physical
activities may be beneficial for longevity as well as better quality of life. Although

the anti-aging characteristic of fermented foods have been evaluate during different
*invivo* and *invitro* models but further studies need to be planned at the clinical level
on a wide variety of fermented foods to ascertain their health benefits in humans.

##### **Chapter 10**
#### **Milk and Other Dairy Product Trends** **in Health and Longevity**

**Dino Demirovic Holmquist**

**Abstract** In recent years, the dairy industry is undergoing a disruption in consumer
trends and efforts for a sustainable production. Being the only species consuming
milk and dairy products post infancy and from other species, this has been an important nutritional source. Today, in the western society, the traditional consumption of
dairy products is being challenged by a vast number of alternatives, which is forcing
the dairy industry to innovate and bring new products into market. Some of the new
trends have a focus on functionality, health, and availability. Here we will go through
the basic nutritional elements of milk and dairy products, and cover some of the new
trends and their effects on human health.

###### **10.1 Introduction**

Mammals are characterized by the presence of mammary glands which in females
produce milk for feeding their young offspring. Humans seem to be the only species
who consume milk and other dairy products after infancy, and the only species that
consume milk and dairy products from other animals on a regular basis. Due to the
high nutritional value of dairy products, these have been an optimal primary food
source in many developing countries. In recent years, however, the consumption of
milk has declined globally, which might be due to the myths and fallacies, or due to
other trends in food consumption. Here we will go through the components in milk
and dairy products, and their relevance in human health together with recent trends
in dairy foods. D. D. Holmquist ( B )

###### **10.2 Nutrients in Dairy Products**

Dairy products mainly consist of three macronutrients, fat, protein, and lactose, plus
some other micronutrients and minerals such as calcium, potassium, magnesium
and zinc. Furthermore, most dairy products have a significant concentration of vitamins D and B12. Bovine milk contains approximately 4.6% lactose, 4.2% fat, 3.4%
protein, 0.8% minerals and 0.1% vitamins. This composition of milk undergoes
changes depending on various factors such as breed, feeding, seasonality, days in
milk, lactation stage, cow- and herd-managements etc. (Timlin et al. 2021).
The lipids in milkfat are present in microglobules as an oil and water emulsion
consisting of mostly triglycerides (98%), cholesterol (less than 0.5%), phospholipids
(about 1%) and free fatty acids (about 0.1%). It has often been reported that dairy
products with a high fat content have a negative effect on longevity and health, while
the opposite might be true with lower fat dairy products (Tucker 2019). However,
other studies show that there is no increased mortality with intake of dairy products
with higher fat content (Dehghan et al. 2018), suggesting that other dietary factors
also play a major role in longevity and health. ***10.2.1 Proteins in Dairy***

Dairy proteins primarily include caseins (which is a conglomeration of alpha caseins
1 and 2, beta casein, and kappa casein), alpha-lactalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin,
and bovine serum albumin. The beneficial properties of dairy proteins are often
attributable to their bioactive peptides released during digestion or food processing
(McGregor and Poppitt 2013). Studies have shown several bovine peptides having
biologically active properties, including osteopontin, which have shown promising
results in infant nutrition and has been shown to attenuate colitis and alcohol-induced

liver injury (Christensen and Sorensen 2016). Furthermore, bovine milk contains a
great number of peptides which either during food processing or in the gastrointestinal tract can be degraded into peptides that possesses antihypertensive effects
(Siltari et al. 2019) and some of them in a dose-dependent matter (Leeuw et al.
2008). More than 200 dairy peptides have shown to have beneficial health effects on
human health which therefore attract the interest of researchers as a health promoting
functional food (Patil et al. 2017). ***10.2.2 Dairy Sugars***

Milk carbohydrates are predominantly lactose with trace amounts of monosaccharides and oligosaccharides. Lactose is a disaccharide of glucose and galactose. The
pasteurization of the milk and dairy products usually does not have a significant


-----

10 Milk and Other Dairy Product Trends in Health and Longevity 195

effect on the sugars, however ultra-high temperature (UHT) pasteurization can cause
Maillard reactions which can produce undesirable flavors and colors (Stojanskova
et al. 2017). The majority (almost 65%) of the world’s population have some sort
of lactose malabsorption or intolerance, especially in the African and Asian regions
(Scrimshaw and Murray 1988). This has caused an increasing demand for low-lactose
or lactose-free dairy products.
###### **10.3 New Product Development**

While the dairy industry for a long time have had the principle of not manipulating
the raw product as far as possible, and only subjecting it to pasteurization for the
removal of pathogenic microorganisms, and homogenization for product stability.
There is usually no further treatment of milk, although some countries may require
addition of certain vitamins, such as in United States all fluid pasteurized milk must
be fortified with vitamin D at a minimum of 400 International Units (IU) (FDA
Pasteurized Milk Ordinance 2017), whereas fortification with 2000 IU vitamin A
has been mandatory for lower-fat fluid milk and optional for whole milk (Yeh et al.
2017). This is constantly pressing the dairy industry to innovate the products through
other means, and one of the new approaches is to manipulate fatty acid composition
of the raw milk by both genetic breeding of the dairy cows and by manipulating
their feeding rations and composition (Schroeder et al. 2003). Recent studies have
shown that the major groups of fatty acids (saturated, mono-unsaturated, and polyunsaturated) can be manipulated by up to 30% by feed alone (Holmquist et al. 2019).
This is already leading to new product development in various countries, including
Denmark, Norway, UK and Switzerland, which enables new flavors and textures of
cheeses and butter products.
Today the dairy industry faces new challenges by new consumer trends with
increasing sales of the so-called non-dairy alternatives, including beverages made
from soy, almonds, oat etc. These products are made in a more sustainable production
environment, which appeals to increasing number of consumers. However, despite
some countries having the designation “milk”, these products have rarely the same
nutritional benefits as of the milk from mammals (Walsh and Gunn 2020). There
is no significant difference in the consumption of these non-dairy alternatives when
it comes to countries where the designation “milk” is allowed (such as USA) and
where marketing of the word “milk” is prohibited (such as the European Union),
according to data from Information Resources Inc. (IRI), Chicago, US 2020. ***10.3.1 Low Fat – High Protein***

One of the most recent and successful dairy trends has been the introduction of
low-fat, high-protein products. Since the early 2000’s the high protein products have


-----

196 D. D. Holmquist

mainly been targeted to serious heavy bodybuilding athletes and the old persons. The
latter is due to the fact that the older persons are at high risk of insufficient protein
ingestion. Older individuals therefore need to ingest a greater quantity of protein to
maintain muscle function (Landi et al. 2016). More recent years, however, have seen
an increase in high protein content products, such as various ready to drink products
and yoghurts, which appeal to the general consumer. These products also tend to
have lower amounts of total fat and usually no added sugars.
Recently, a new category of dairy products with A2 beta-caseins have emerged by
the genetic profiling of the dairy herds. Approximately 5–10,000 years ago a point
mutation occurred in some European dairy cattle introducing a new beta-casein
type, the A1. The difference between A1 and A2 beta-caseins is that A2 beta-casein
has a proline amino acid on the 67 [th] position of the 209 amino acid long protein,
whereas the A2 beta-casein has a histidine amino acid on this position. Once milk
or milk products are consumed, the action of the digestive enzymes in the gut on
A1 beta-caseins releases the bioactive opioid peptide beta-casomoprohin-7 (BCM7), which seems to significantly increase gastrointestinal transit time, production
of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and the inflammatory marker myeloperoxidase (Pal et al.
2015). In humans a double-blind, randomized study has shown that participants who
consumed A1 beta-casein type cows’ milk had a statistically significant higher Bristol
stool values, as compared to users of A2 beta-casein type of cow’s milk (Ho et al.
2014).
The most common assumption for milk intolerance is the insufficient lactase
enzyme activity; however, the National Institute of Health made a consensus statement in 2010 on lactose intolerance stating that “many who self-reported lactose
intolerance shows no evidence of lactose malabsorption. Thus, the cause of their
gastrointestinal symptoms is unlikely to be related to lactose” (Suchy et al. 2010).
Therefore, some milk intolerance appears to be linked to the presence of BCM-7
after digestion of A1 beta-caseins, though more research has to be completed on
these cases.

Other functions of dairy proteins have been linked to various bioactive peptides
within the amino acid sequences of native milk proteins. Once bioactive peptides are
liberated, they exhibit a wide variety of physiological functions in the human body
such as gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, immune, endocrine and nervous system.
Usually, the bioactive proteins are inactive within the sequence of the native or parent
protein, however they can be released by the hydrolysis in the digestive system or by
proteolytic microorganisms, or by proteolytic enzymes derived from microorganisms
or plants (Korhonen and Pihlanto 2007).
###### **10.4 Minerals, Vitamins and Antioxidants**

Milk contains a large concentration of non-nutritional components, such as minerals,
vitamins, and antioxidants. The latter have a role in the protection of the oxidation of
the milk, and may also have antioxidant effects in the milk-producing cells and for


-----

10 Milk and Other Dairy Product Trends in Health and Longevity 197

the udder. The major antioxidants in milk are the vitamins A and E and the mineral
selenium (Lindmark-Mansson and Akesson 2000).
Bovine milk has a calcium concentration of about 1 g/l, and daily intake of milk
and dairy products has a central role in securing calcium intake in humans. Sufficient
calcium intake is essential for healthy bones and teeth, and it also prevents hypertension, decrease the risks for colon and breast cancers and reduces the risk of kidney
stones (Insel et al. 2004).
Another noticeable non-nutritional component is selenium, which has a role
in immune- and antioxidant system and in DNA synthesis and repair (Dodig and
Cepelak 2004). Milk also contains large amounts of iodine (about 60 µg iodine/l,),
which is sufficient for up to 50% of the recommended daily intake for adults. Iodine
plays a vital role in thyroids hormones, which regulates body metabolic rate, temperature regulation, reproduction and growth. Milk furthermore has a good concentration of magnesium, containing about 100 mg/l. Deficiency in magnesium has been
linked to atherosclerosis, as studies have shown that deficiency may cause oxidative
stress (Hans et al. 2002). Milk is also a good source of zinc, which has several functions in the human body including in DNA repair, cell growth and replication, gene
expression, protein and lipid metabolism etc. (Insel et al. 2004).
As mentioned above, milk also has increased levels of vitamins, among which
is Vitamin E, which is associated with decreased risk for cancer and coronary heart
disease (Hayes et al. 2001). Other vitamins in milk includes vitamin A, which plays
a role in vision and growth in children; folates which has been associated with the
growth of neural networks; riboflavin which has antioxidant effects; and vitamin B12
which plays a vital role in homocysteine metabolism.
###### **10.5 Conclusion**

Milk and dairy products have had a great impact in our society and is still playing
a major role in human nutrition in developing countries. In developed countries,
consumer trends are moving to many alternatives to classical bovine (or other
animals’) milk, usually coming from a plant, nut, or bean source. With emerging
companies such as the Israeli and US-based ImaginDairy and Perfect Day, there is
another movement which is not looking to change existing milk and dairy products,
but rather developing dairy products from ingredients produced by microorganisms
in a laboratory. However, this new technology still needs both scalability for a larger
production, and a general broad consumer acceptance.

**Abstract** Inflammageing underlies ageing- and age-related chronic diseases, while
age-related chronic diseases also underpin inflammageing and ageing. The featured
inflammageing mechanisms are the inflammasome; DNA damage including telomere
shortening; accumulated cellular senescence; immunosenesence; increased synthesis
of proinflammatory miRNAs through activation of pathways such as NF-κB, mTOR,
and sirtuins; dysbiosis of the gut microbiota; and meta-inflammation. It is observed
that fruits, vegetables, olive oil, fish oil, whole grains, legumes, nuts, flavonoid-rich
green tea, carotenoids, omega-3 fatty acids, fibre, and pre- and pro-biotics can inhibit
these mechanisms and promote the prevention of chronic diseases such as diabetes,
cardiovasculardiseases,cancer,andneurodegenerativediseasesthatunderpininflammageing and ageing. However, the studies are mostly in vitro and in vivo animal
model studies. Thus, there is a need for more prospective and clinical studies on antiinflammatory foods in ageing and longevity. Moreover, it is important to consider
that explainingtherelationbetweendiet, low-gradechronicinflammation, andageing
not only depends on a single food component in the concept of anti-inflammatory
food, but also dietary pattern. Even though there are scarce human studies on benefits of these potential anti-inflammatory effects in ageing and longevity, adopting
a Mediterranean dietary pattern and recommended consumption amounts can be
suggested.

this process of acute inflammation, heat, swelling, redness, and pain are distinguished
(Fougère et al. 2017). Different from this acute response is chronic inflammation,
which is a low-grade, sustained, and systemic response of tissue that causes degeneration via inflammatory markers such as inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6,
IL-1, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α), chemokines (monocyte chemoattractant
protein-1 (MCP-1)), cell adhesion molecules (VCAM-1, ICAM-1), and acute phase
proteins (C-reactive protein).
Ageing, diet, smoking, etc., have been identified as chronic pro-inflammatory
factors. It has been shown that chronic inflammation underlies ageing- and agerelated diseases such as cancer, diabetes, obesity, and atherosclerosis (Guarner and
Rubio-Ruiz 2015). Thus, ageing is characterized by increased levels of inflammatory
markers, and this age-related inflammation is termed inflammageing (Sanada et al.
2018; Calder et al. 2017).
There are many mechanisms that have a role in inflammageing. Some of the mechanisms related to inflammageing are oxidative stress, glycation, immunosenesence,
mitochondrial dysfunction, chronic infections, epigenetic and hormonal changes, and
diet (Fougère et al. 2017; Ekmekcio˘glu 2020). The balance between these inflammageing sources and sources of anti-inflammageing factors such as healthy nutrition
is important to restrain age-related diseases. With respect to diet, dietary pattern is
assumed that have positive effects on chronic inflammation in age-related diseases
(Monti et al. 2017).
It has been shown that the food contents of fibre, flavonoids, carotenoids, and
omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory effects, while simple carbohydrates,
and saturated and trans fatty acids have pro-inflammatory effects (Galland 2010).
Thus, foods rich in anti-inflammatory components (whole grains, fruits, vegetables,
legumes, nuts, and tea) can be called anti-inflammatory foods. The Mediterranean
Diet is a dietary pattern composed of a high amount of the anti-inflammatory foods
and a low amount of foods poor in these pro-inflammatory components. This diet is
related to lower chronic inflammation (Calder et al. 2011). Therefore, explaining the
relation between diet, low-grade chronic inflammation, and ageing not only depends
on single food content in the concept of anti-inflammatory food, but also dietary
pattern. In this chapter, the aim is to underline featured foods with anti-inflammatory
effects in ageing and longevity.
###### **11.2 Anti-inflammatory Dietary Pattern, Ageing,** **and Longevity**

Inflammation has been assessed with inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, cell adhesion molecules, and acute phase proteins as biomarkers. As an acute inflammation
response in infection, microbial cell membranes and nucleic acid are recognized by
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as toll-like receptors (TLRs)
and retinoic acid-inducible gene-1-like receptors (RLRs). As a chronic inflammation

11 Anti-inflammatory Foods in Ageing and Longevity 201

response in inflammatory diseases, substances called danger-associated molecular
patterns (DAMPs) are secreted. However, it is indicated that sometimes, it is very
hard to differentiate these responses as either acute or chronic (Kourtgen and Bauer
2018).
Even though there are various biomarkers to assess acute and chronic inflammation, only a few of them are acceptable in clinical and epidemiological studies that
are related to diseases and diet as a factor relevant to chronic inflammation. In this
context, the mostly assessed pro-inflammatory cytokines are TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6,
and the anti-inflammatory cytokines are IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, and transforming growth
factor (TGF)-β. Actually, there is not a certain line to define the cytokines as pro- and
anti- inflammatory, and its depends on the local environment of released cytokines,
cytokine receptor density, synergistic and competing factors, and tissue response.
However, most commonly, TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6 are found as pro-inflammatory.
Besides cytokines, other commonly assessed biomarkers are chemokines, and
MCP-1/CCL2 is the most featured one. It is responsible for modulating migration
and infiltration of monocytes and macrophages. Cell adhesion molecules are responsible for modulating migration of leucocytes, and VCAM-1 is one of the key types.
Both MCP-1 and VCAM-1 have key roles in the basic inflammation process in
endothelial cells. Also, acute-phase proteins are commonly assessed for inflammation, and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), fibrinogen, serum amyloid A,
ceruloplasmin, and CRP are the most used ones. CRP is used to evaluate the level
of infection and the development and risk of chronic inflammatory diseases such
as cancer (Wu and Schauss 2012; Casas et al. 2014). According to meta-analysis
results, healthy dietary patterns are negatively associated with CRP levels in adults
(Neale et al. 2016).
Overall, concerning dietary pattern or food components, the most used key
biomarkers are included in a posteriori methods in research. While these a posteriori
results are important to assess the relation between diet and inflammation, a priori
methods using diet scores are also important (Calder et al. 2011). There are some
indices that are used to evaluate dietary patterns and the risk of chronic diseases,
such as the Healthy Eating Index, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Index,
Diet Inflammatory Index, and Mediterranean Diet Scores (Calle and Andersen 2019;
Marcason 2010). It has been indicated that the Diet Inflammatory Index is more
advantageous than other indices to determine risk of inflammatory diseases related
to diet (Wirth et al. 2016). On the other hand, Mediterranean Diet Scores have also
been indicated as good indices to observe relations with inflammatory biomarkers to
evaluate inflammatory disease risk (Casas et al. 2014).
In general, the studies on inflammatory biomarkers and dietary patterns are observational, and the common points of these different indices are that they are mostly
based on fruits and vegetables (Barbaresko et al. 2013). The results mostly depend
on observational short-term studies, and dietary patterns are more effective to evaluate diet-related inflammatory biomarkers and predict disease risk from a broader
perspective (Corley et al. 2015). There are many cofactors that effect inflammatory


-----

biomarkers, and it is hard to identify mechanisms of dietary patterns and inflammation. Studies on inflammation and dietary patterns point out foods and food components that are potentially anti-inflammatory (Calle and Andersen 2019). Therefore,
to understand the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of diet, intervention studies based
on specific food are important. Thus, in a holistic view dietary pattern, food and food
components are combined with each other, and all of them are related to ageing and
lifespan. This chapter focuses on food components and inflammatory pathways to
explain effects on ageing and lifespan.
###### **11.3 Anti-inflammatory Foods, Ageing, and Longevity**

Since older people have increased levels of cytokines and chemokines, it can be said
that systemic low-grade chronic inflammation mostly rises with age. This inflammation type involves most of the tissues (such as adipose and muscle tissues),
organs (such as the brain and liver), systems (such as the immune system), and
ecosystems (such as the gut microbiota). The circadian rhythm, chronic stress, xenobiotics, diet, dysbiosis, obesity, chronic infections, and physical inactivity trigger
systemic low-grade chronic inflammation. Eventually, chronic low-grade inflammation causes tissue damage and hence metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, neurogenerative diseases, sarcopenia, osteoporosis, and
immunosenesence (Monti et al. 2017; Furman et al. 2019). Thus, inflammageing
underliesageing-andage-relatedchronicdiseases,whileage-relatedchronicdiseases
underpin inflammageing and ageing (Franceschi et al. 2018).
There are several molecular mechanisms related to inflammageing: (i) oxidative stress, dysfunction of mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum stress cause
increased production of DAMPs that activate inflammasome and NF-κB. (ii)
DNA damage, including telomere shortening, occurs through oxidative stress and
other factors and triggers secretion of pro-inflammatory compounds. (iii) Cellular
senescence increases with age, accumulated senescence cells acquire senescenceassociated secretory phenotype (SASP), and senescent cells drag along neighbour
cells to senescence through SASP. (iv) In immunosenesence, age-related changes
occur in innate and adaptive immune cells, which is also accepted as a characteristic
of inflammageing as chronic activation of the innate immune system. (v) Age-related
increase production of galactosylated immunoglobulin (Ig-G-GO) occurs, and (vi)
there is increased synthesis of proinflammatory miRNAs through activation of pathways such as NF-κB, mTOR, sirtuins, and TGF-β pathways. (vii) There is also
dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, and viii) meta-inflammation mediated by excess
nutrients (particularly glucose and fatty acids) and energy trigger stress in pancreas,
liver, muscle, and adipose tissue, resulting with secretion of cytokines, chemokines,
and adipokines (Cevenini et al. 2013; Monti et al. 2017; Calder et al. 2017). Overall,
the immune system, adipose tissue, liver, muscle, and gut microbiota contribute
to inflammageing and meta-inflammation (circulating molecular mediator) and thus


-----

11 Anti-inflammatory Foods in Ageing and Longevity 203

multi-system inflammation (cardiovascular diseases, obesity, type 2 diabetes, cancer,
neurodegenerative diseases, etc.) (Cevenini et al. 2013; Monti et al. 2017).
A healthy dietary pattern such as the Mediterranean diet can prevent and mitigate
inflammatory diseases by anti-inflammatory effects. This diet is characterized by
high consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, olive oil, and
fish oil, so the intake of bioactive components such as phytochemicals, vitamins, and
fatty acids is high (Estruch 2010). These components play a potential a key role in
suppression of molecular mechanisms of inflammageing.
###### ***11.3.1 Fruits and Vegetables***

Fruits and vegetables are indispensable parts of a healthy dietary pattern since not
only are they rich in micronutrients, but they are also rich in various phytochemicals, such as phenolics and carotenoids. Each fruit and vegetable differs in phenolic
composition, so consuming various types of fruits and vegetables is important while
aiming to reach suggested healthy consumption amounts. Flavonoids are the most
common phenolic compounds found in fruits and vegetables that and are relevant to
inflammation (Zhang et al. 2015; Oz and Kafkas 2017).
Nuclear factor (NF)-κβ and activator protein-1 (AP-1) are commonly used molecular targets to assess inflammation and in phytochemical treatment studies. NF-κβ
has a pivotal role in inflammatory response. The phosphorylation status of these
factors is regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. MAPK
involves subgroups such as p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and
C-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signalling pathways and activates NF-κβ and AP-1
as an inflammatory response. In addition, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a PAMP that
binds to TLR4 and hence activates NF-κβ and AP-1 mediated by MAPKs. Also, it
is known that TNF-α, IL-6, and CRP activate NF-κβ. NF-κβ is also responsible for
the expression of enzymes such as cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and the inducible nitric
oxide synthase (iNOS), as well as chemokines and adhesion molecules (Chung et al.
2021).
Resveratrol is the most common stilbene compound abundantly found in grapes,
berries, peanuts, and wine. Resveratrol exhibits anti-inflammatory effects via
suppression of NF-κB, JAK-STAT, and AP-1 signalling pathways, which cause the
production of inflammatory mediators such as IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, and NO
in vitro and in vivo. Also, resveratrol suppresses COX and lipoxygenase (LOX)
enzyme activities in the synthesis of leucotriens, eicosonoids such as thromboxanes,
and prostanoids such as prostaglandins (Csiszar 2011; Ma et al. 2015; de Sá Coutinho
et al. 2018; Banez et al. 2020). In addition, in association with these mechanisms,
resveratrol exerts neuro- and cardioprotection effects, prevents cancer, and ameliorates the ageing process. These effects of resveratrol are supported in clinical trials,
but there is a need for more studies (Banez et al. 2020).

Flavones, flavonols, and flavanones are the three flavonoid subgroups. Apigenin
and luteolin are the most common flavones. Apigenin occurs in apple, orange, grapefruit, chamomile, celery, parsley, and onion. Apigenin inhibits activation of NF-κB,
which is a transcription factor that has a crucial role in iNOS and COX-2 expression and mitigates IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and inflammatory cell infiltration in vitro
and in vivo (Ai et al. 2017; Dang et al. 2018; Xie et al. 2019). It is suggested that
a diet rich in apigenin attenuates LPS-induced inflammation via regulation of gene
expression in vivo by inhibiting IL-1β production via caspase-1 activation, inhibiting
IL-1β and IL-6 production via inhibition of ERK1/2, and inhibiting TNF-α-induced
activation of NF-kB (Wang et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2014; Arango et al. 2015).
Apigenin also reduces LPS-induced inflammation in vitro by suppressing NO
and prostaglandin production by inhibiting iNOS and COX-2, respectively, as well
as caspase-3 activity, which is a central modulator of apoptosis. Thus, apigenin
can reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases,
cancer, and Alzheimer’s disease (Duarte et al. 2013; Choi et al. 2014). In addition,
both apigenin and luteolin inhibit TNFα-induced expression of CCL2/MCP-1 and
CXCL1/KC (Funakoshi-Tago et al. 2011). Luteolin occurs in many vegetables, such
as artichoke, broccoli, pepper, thyme, turnip, cucumber, and celery. Luteolin inhibits
IL-1β and TNF-α expression by regulating transcription factors such as STAT3, NFκB, and AP-1 in vitro and in vivo *.* Therefore, it has been suggested that luteolin may
reduce risk of inflammatory diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases and cancer
(Nabavi et al. 2015; Hayasaka et al. 2018; Aziz et al. 2018).
Quercetin is the most common flavonol and is found in apples, onions, berries,
and capers. It decreases CRP, SAA, fibrinogen, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and NO in vitro
and in vivo. Quercetin inhibits TNF-α by inactivation of ERK, c-Jun, and NF-κB, as
well as the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ)
(Kleemann et al. 2011; Li et al. 2016). Also, quercetin inhibits COX-2 activity (Lesjak
et al. 2018). Thus, similar to apigenin and luteolin, quercetin may also reduce the
risk of chronic inflammatory diseases.
Hesperidin and naringenin are the most common flavonones and are abundantly
found in citrus fruits (Yi et al. 2017). It is indicated that hesperidin inhibits NFκB and thus iNOS and COX-2 activities in vitro and in vivo (Parhiz et al. 2015;
Tejada et al. 2018). In addition, hesperidin suppresses the production of IL-2, IL-4,
IL-10, NF-κB/p65, COX-2, IL-1β, TNF-α, MMP-3, and MMP-9, while it stimulates
production of IL-10 in chondrocytes and chondroitin mesenchymal stem cells in vitro
(Xiao et al. 2018a, b; Tsai et al. 2019). Another flavanone, naringenin, either activates
SIRT1 enzyme and prevents senescence in vitro or reduces TNF-α and IL-6 in vivo
in myocardial cells and tissues (Testai et al. 2020). Therefore, flavonones can prevent
cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer (Yi et al. 2017).
Anthocyanins are another subgroup of flavonoids and are mostly found in berries,
where they result in unique colours. The abundant types of anthocyanins are
cyanidin, pelargonidin, peonidin, delphinidin, petunidin, and malvidin. Similar to
other flavonoids, anthocyanins also exhibit anti-inflammatory effects by reducing
iNOSandCOX-2activity,aswellasmodulateNF-κβ andMAPKsignallingcascades,
thus reducing TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and NO production in vitro and in vivo (Vendrame

and Klimis-Zacas 2015). Despite this, there is a need for more evidence on those
mechanisms of action of anthocyanins to support their use in epidemiological and
clinical trials (Joseph et al. 2014). Furthermore, it has been indicated that anthocyanins can also modulate the gut microbiota, and all of the other mechanisms of
action provide protection from chronic inflammatory diseases (Morais et al. 2016;
Ma et al. 2018). Overall, flavonoids have anti-inflammatory effects and play a role
in preventing chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer (Griffithd
et al. 2016).
Lycopene, β-carotene, and lutein are carotenoids that are more commonly present
infoods.Lycopenemainlyoccursintomatoesandtomatoproducts.Lycopeneinhibits
LPS-induced NO, IL-6, TNF-α, and secretory phospholipase A2 production by
suppressing ERK, p38MAPK, NF- *κ* B, and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)
activation in vitro and in vivo (Feng et al. 2010; Lee et al. 2012; Marcotorchino
et al. 2012; He et al. 2015). Lycopene also inhibits LPS-induced COX-2 and iNOS
activities in human keratinocyte cells (Kim et al. 2014). Lycopene also suppresses
high-fat-diet-induced inflammation via reduction of NF- *κ* B/p65 (Fenni et al. 2017).
Lycopene reduces SAA levels in overweight individuals (McEneny et al. 2013),
and lycopene and lutein together attenuate VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and TNF-α-induced
leukocyte adhesion and the NF-κB signalling pathway in human endothelial cells
(Armoza et al. 2013).
Lutein is mainly found in corn and tangerines and attenuates IL-6 production and
COX-2 activity. It also suppresses AP-1 activation by the inhibition of JNK/p38 in
human keratinocyte cells (Arscott 2013; Oh et al. 2013). Lutein also suppresses NFκB activation by inhibition of JNK/p38 and Akt in LPS-activated BV-2 microglia
cells (Wu et al. 2015). In addition, lutein inhibits NF-κB and COX-2 activation and
reduces IL-1β production in retinal ischemic/hypoxic injury in vitro and in vivo (Li
et al. 2012). Lutein suppresses activation of NF-κB, inhibits COX-2 activity, and
decreases IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β in primary chondrocyte cells (Qiao et al. 2018).
Thus, lutein can reduce the risk of inflammatory diseases such as osteoarthritis,
age-related macular degeneration, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative
diseases (Kijlstra et al. 2012). β-carotene present in carrots (Arscott 2013).
LPS-induced NF-κB, JAK2/STAT3, and JNK/p38 MAPK activation is suppressed
by β-carotene in macrophages (Li et al. 2018). β-carotene inhibits virus-induced NO,
IL-1b, IL-6, and MCP-1 production and NF-κB, JNK/p38, and ERK activation in
macrophages (Lin et al. 2012). Both β-carotene and lycopene reduce the inflammatory response in vitro (Di Tomo et al. 2012; Kawata et al. 2018). To sum up,
even though there are contrary results about the mechanisms of action related to
anti-inflammatory effects of carotenoids, they can lower the risk of cardiovascular
diseases, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and cancer (Ciccone et al. 2013; Kaulmann and
Bohn 2014; Honarvar et al. 2017).
In a comprehensive manner, phytochemicals in fruits and vegetables ameliorate
the inflammatory response in the short and long term (Joseph et al. 2016). These
effects on inflammageing mainly occur by mitigating NF-κB. Also, phytochemicals
attenuate cellular senescence and immunosenesence in immune cells (Sharma and
Padwad 2020). Studies have been mostly in vitro and in vivo animal studies, and

there is a need for epidemiological and clinical studies to support these effects in
humans and improving dietary recommendations.
###### ***11.3.2 Olive Oil***

Olive oil is one of the crucial components of the Mediterranean diet responsible
for positive health effects (Virruso et al. 2014). Olive oil is obtained solely from
the olive tree fruit ( *Olea europaea* L.). A number of processes are used, and virgin
olive oil is obtained exclusively by specific mechanical processes that do not alter
the oil. The virgin olive oils are classified as extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), virgin,
and lampante according to the degree of acidity. All of these virgin oils mainly
contain monounsaturated fatty acids, particularly oleic acid, as well as tocopherols,
tocotrienols, b-carotene, phytosterols, flavonoids, and phenolic compounds, such
as oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol, and oleocanthal (Ghanbari et al. 2012; Souza et al.
2017).
It has been suggested that phenolic compounds found in olive oil, such as
hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and oleocanthal, can mitigate NF-kB and relevant signalling
cascades, suppress eicosonoid synthesis, and enzyme activities i *n vitro* and in vivo
(Souza et al. 2017). A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled
trials on regular dietary intake of olive oil indicated that olive oil is associated with
decreased levels of CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α (Fernandes et al. 2020). Oleic acid is
abundantly found in olive oil, but it has higher concentrations in seed oils such as
sunflower, rapeseed, and soybean oil. However, olive oil contains specific phenolics that are not present in seed oils. The specific phenolic compounds have antiinflammatory effects in vitro and in *vivo,* hence reducing the risk of chronic disease
development (Cicarelle et al. 2012).
It has been indicated that EVOO and its phenolic compounds inhibit NF-kB
and STATs and modulate JAK/STATs, ERK/MAPKs, JNK, and AKT pathways in
immune-mediated inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory
bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, and psoriasis (Santangelo et al. 2017). In addition, EVOO reduces NO and PGE2 by suppression of iNOS and COX-2 expression.
It also inhibits MAPK and NF-kB and thus TNFα and IL-6 production in LPS or
IFNγ-stimulated murine macrophages (Cárdeno et al. 2014a, b). Moreover, the olive
oil polyphenol hydroxytyrosol reduces PGE2 due to inhibition of COX-2 activity in
human monocytes (Rosignoli et al. 2013). Hydroxytyrosol also inhibits NF-kB and
thus TNF-α (Killeen et al. 2014).
Another olive oil polyphenol oleocanthal inhibits COX-1, COX-2, and iNOS
activities, as well as tau-tau interaction in neuron cells (Lucas et al. 2011; Cicerale
et al. 2012). Thus, according to these in vitro an in vivo study results, virgin olive
oils can prevent cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, degenerative joint diseases,
and neurodegenerative diseases, which is basically related to their hydroxytyrosol
and oleocanthal content. However, clinical trials are scarce (Parkinson and Cicerale
2016).

###### ***11.3.3 Fish Oil***

α-linolenic acid is a short-chain plant form of omega-3 fatty acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) are long-chain fatty acids (FAs)
that are the marine forms of omega-3 fatty acids. These fatty acids occur in sea
foods in lean and oily fish. Some sea foods, oily fish, and livers of some lean fish
include much more marine omega-3 fatty acids (Calder 2010). Omega-3 fatty acids
inhibit pro-inflammatory leucocyte chemotaxis, adhesion molecule expression, and
leucocyte-endothelial adhesive interactions. In particular, EPA upregulates 3 series of
prostoglandins and leukotriens that are low-proinflammatory compounds compared
to 2 series of prostoglandins and 4 series of leucotriens upregulated by AA (Calder
2012).
Obesity is seen as an inflammatory disease due to TNF-α and IL-6 increasing and
adiponectin decreasing in adipocytes. In addition, CRP increases from hepatocytes
mediated by IL-6 (Ellulu et al. 2015). Omaga-3 PUFAs suppress NF-kB and thus
CRP and IL-6 production. Also, omega-3 FAs up-regulate PPARγ, which induces fat
cell differentiation and maturation. Therefore, omega-3 FAs promote adipogenesis
and a healthy expansion of adipose tissue, while omega-6 FAs have reverse effects
on expansion of adipose tissue.
The free fatty acid receptor (FFAR) family has a role in both energy homeostasis
and the inflammatory response in different cell types. Macrophage infiltration into
adipose tissue is decreased via omega-3 PUFAs, which activate FFAR4/G proteincoupled receptor 120 (Jayarathne et al. 2017; Albracht-Schulte et al. 2018). In addition, resolving D series and resolving E series are synthesized from DHA and EPA,
respectively, which have anti-inflammatory effects due to inhibiting inflammatory
cytokine synthesis and clearance of inflammatory cells related to cardiovascular
health (Oppedisano et al. 2020).
Many of these effects are related to changes in fatty acid composition of cell
membranes. The changes can modify membrane fluidity and cell signalling, evoke
gene expression changes, and change the pattern of lipid mediator production. For
instance, richness in n − 6 fatty acid AA composition of cell membranes leads to
an inflammatory response (Calder 2012). Thus, the omega-6/omega-3 balance is
important for inflammatory processes and thus health maintenance.
It has been indicated that if the omega-6/omega-3 ratio is 3–5:1, mortality is
decreased (Candela et al. 2011). In addition, it has been observed that omega-3 FAs
attenuates cellular senescence of immune cells via telomere shortening and inhibition
of SASP. Also, it ameliorates harmful effects of the cellular and humoral immune
response during immunosenesence (Sharma and Padwad 2020).
Overall, in clinical studies, dietary omega-3 fatty acids have been related to lower
inflammatory biomarkers such as CRP, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1, as well as endothelial
activation in cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic renal disease, Alzheimer’s
disease, sepsis, acute pancreatitis, and cancer (Rangel-Huerta et al. 2012; Mocellin

`
et al. 2016; Laye et al. 2017; Natto et al. 2019). In addition, marine n − 3 fatty acids
were tested in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel

disease (IBD) and asthma. They showed positive effects in clinical trials on RA, but
not in IBD and asthma (Calder 2015; Akbar et al. 2017).
###### ***11.3.4 Whole Grains***

The most consumed whole grain foods are whole wheat, whole oats, whole barley,
whole rye and their flours, bulgur, brown rice, amaranth, sorghum, and their products such as bread, granola, etc. It is reported that whole grains lower CRP levels
in epidemiological studies (Lefevre and Jonnalagadda 2012). Moreover, two metaanalyses of randomized control trials reported that whole grain consumption is negatively related to high-sensitivity-CRP (hs-CRP), CRP, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β levels
(Xu et al. 2018; Hajihashemi and Haghighatdoost 2018).
In this context, two main components of whole grains are featured: dietary fibre
and phytochemicals since there is robust scientific evidence about them. However,
they have primary effects on consumer acceptability related to qualities such as
colour, texture of the whole-grain product, and their synergistic effects (Awika
et al. 2018). Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of action depend on
β-glukan (a dietary fibre), as well as alkylresorcinols and avenanthramides (phytochemicals). These show anti-inflammatory effects by modulating the gut microbiota.
While β-glukanisfermentedintoshort-chainfattyacids,alkylresorcinolsandavenanthramides are fermented into phenolic acids such as cinnamic acid, cafeic acid, and
ferulic acid by the gut microbiota. These microbial-derived metabolites inhibit LPS,
IFN-γ, and reactive oxygen species-induced NF-κB expression and hence attenuate
TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and CRP (Sang et al. 2020). Thus, bioactive components of
whole grains have anti-inflammatory activities that could reduce the risk of chronic
diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and dementia (Lee et al.
2015). ***11.3.5 Legumes***

Soybeans, kidney beans, lentils, and cowpeas are common legumes, which are
rich in fibre and protein (Rebello et al. 2014). Legumes contain various bioactive compounds, such as phenolics, peptides, and saponins, which exhibit antiinflammatory effects (Serventi and Dsouza 2020). Legume seed hulls are rich in
phenolics, and it is indicated that lentil hulls inhibit 15-LOX, COX-1, and COX2 activities (Boudjo et al. 2013). Legume proteins, particularly soybean and bean
proteins, are digested into bioactive peptides that can modify NO, PGE2 (and thus
iNOS), and COX- 2 activities, as well as cytokines and chemokines in vitro and
in vivo (Reyes-Díaz et al. 2019). It is also observed that legume saponins, particularly soy saponins, attenuate NO, TNF-α, PGE2, and MCP-1, suppress iNOS and
COX-2 activities, and mitigate NF-κB activation (Zhu et al. 2018).


-----

11 Anti-inflammatory Foods in Ageing and Longevity 209

A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials demonstrated that decreased CRP
and hs-CRP levels are associated with non-soy legume consumption, although more
clinical studies are needed to clarified the effects of non-soy legume consumption on
inflammatory markers (Salehi-Abargouei et al. 2015). To conclude, legumes contain
various bioactive compounds that display anti-inflammatory effects, thus suggesting
they could prevent inflammatory diseases. However, there is a need for more studies
on the anti-inflammatory impact of legumes (not only clinical but also animal and
molecular study models).
###### ***11.3.6 Nuts***

The common tree nuts are almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts, pecans, pistachios, and walnuts. Almonds, hazelnuts, pine nuts, pistachios, and walnuts are mostly
involved in the Mediterranean diet. They are rich in unsaturated fatty acids, protein,
fibre, tocopherols, phytosterols, and polyphenols (Ros 2015). The phytochemical
content of tree nuts can vary considerably by nut type, and they have been associated
with anti-inflammatory impact (Bolling et al. 2011). It has been demonstrated that
increased nut consumption is related to decreased inflammatory disease mortality
(Gopinath et al. 2011). In addition, an epidemiologic study, the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), found that increased nut and seed
consumption is related to increased telomere length, thus decreasing aging and cell
senescence (Tucker 2017).
On the other hand, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials suggests that
nut consumption significantly decreases leptin while having no significant effect on
CRP, IL6, adiponectin, IL10, and TNF-a (Mazidi et al. 2016). Similarly, another
meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials also suggests that nut consumption
significantly reduced ICAM-1 levels but had no effect on other inflammatory markers
such as CRP, IL-6 TNF-α, E-selectin, and VCAM-1 (Xiao et al. 2018a, b). Another
meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials suggests favourable effects of nut
consumption on flow-mediated dilation as a measure of endothelial function (Neale
et al. 2017). The results of these three meta-analyses about non-significant changes
in inflammatory biomarkers consider that there is a need for more randomized
controlled trials on the relationship of nut consumption and inflammation. ***11.3.7 Green Tea***

Green tea has anti-inflammatory effects from the main bioactive component, catechins, which are in the flavonoid subgroup of flavan-3-ols. The four main catechins
in green tea are (-)-epicatechin (EC), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (-)-epicatechin3-gallate (ECG), and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). The most abundant
catechin is EGCG (59%), followed by EGC (≈19%), ECG (≈14%), and EC (≈6%).


-----

210 C. Gezer

Green tea catechins exert anti-inflammatory effects by increased IL-10 and
decreased IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, interferon gamma (INF-γ), CRP, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selection in vitro and in vivo
(Reyaert 2017). In addition, green tea catechins also inhibit COX-2 expression.
EGCG is the most effective green tea catechin and suppresses NF-κB/p38 expression
as well (Riegsecker et al. 2013; Ohishi et al. 2016; Fechtner et al. 2017). High glucose
increases VCAM-1 expression and thus induces inflammation, but EGCG mitigates
PKC and NF-κB signalling in human umbilical-vein endothelial cells (Yang et al.
2013). EGCG also attenuates PCB-126-induced endothelial cell inflammation via
suppression of NF-κB/p65, IL-6, CRP, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and IL-1α/β production
(Liu et al. 2016).
Similarly, EGCG suppresses infrasound-induced increases in NF-κB/p65 and
inhibits IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18, and TNF-α in microglia (Cai et al. 2014). Moreover,
EGCG attenuates TNF-a, MCP-1, ICAM-1, NO, VEGF, and MMP-2 production
and NF-kB and MAPK signalling pathways in LPS-stimulated in L02 hepatocytes
(Liu et al. 2014). Furthermore, it affects the accumulation of senescent cells related
to ageing and age-related diseases. Activation of SIRT3 delays senescence and
SASP-induced inflammation. EGCG possesses anti-inflammatory effects by activating SIRT3 and reducing IL-6 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (Lilja et al. 2020). It has
been reported that EGCG’s anti-inflammatory effects mostly depend on in vitro and
in vivo animal studies (Lu and Yen 2015). However, green tea can demonstrate the
prevention of RA, osteoarthritis, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative
disease, and metabolic syndrome in association with the main component, EGCG
(Afzal et al. 2015).
###### ***11.3.8 Prebiotics and Probiotics***

Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria are the most abundant
phyla of gut microbiota in humans. Gram-positive probiotic bacteria, lactic acid
bacteria, and *Bifidobacteria* are in Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, respectively. In
contrast, the phyla Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria include Gram-negative bacteria
that have LPS induce pro-inflammatory macrophage activity and hence cause infection or diseases under certain conditions (Wang et al. 2020). Dysbiosis is generally
related to impairment of the gut barrier function, so LPS moves through leaky tight
junctions into circulation. Also, LPS activates NF-κβ and AP-1 due to binding to
TLR4. As a result of dysbiosis, types of secondary bile acids that are converted from
primary bile acids in gut are also changed. Therefore, the pro-inflammatory farnesoid
X receptor (FXR) signalling pathway is activated in enterocytes and adipocytes.
In addition, it has been suggested that IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP levels are linked with
specific gut microbial species (Bander et al. 2020). A meta-analysis of randomized
clinical trials demonstrated that CRP and NO levels are lowered by probiotic supplementation (Tabrizi et al. 2019). Another meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials
indicated that hs-CRP, TNF-a, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-4 levels decrease as a result of


-----

11 Anti-inflammatory Foods in Ageing and Longevity 211

probiotic supplementation (Milajerdi et al. 2020). Moreover, it has been reported that
probiotics ameliorate the immune response during immunosenesence and mitigate
cellular senescence in immune cells (Sharma and Padwad 2020).
Acetate, propionate, and butyrate are short-chain fatty acids that are known as
products of the gut microbiota. Dietary fibre and resistant starches are prebiotics
fermented by gut microbiota. Primarily, butyrate is the most effective SCFA associated with the inflammatory process. There are several anti-inflammatory mechanisms of action of butyrate. Firstly, butyrate minimizes transfer of LPS from the
gut to circulation. Secondly, it binds to G-protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43), an
SCFA receptor that regulates inflammatory signals and is expressed in macrophages.
Thirdly, butyrate inhibits NF-kB, IFN-γ, and PPAR-γ (Lescheid 2014; Wang et al.
2020).
It is suggested that butyrate is mainly a product of Ruminococcaceae, Eubacterium, Clostridia, and Firmicutes (Ohira et al. 2017). It has been observed that
altered gut microbiota (in other words, dysbiosis) is related to systemic inflammation and thus diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and inflammatory
bowel diseases (Boulangé et al. 2016; Lescheid, 2014; Wang et al. 2020). Prebiotics
and probiotics ameliorate or prevent these diseases via the mechanisms of action
mentioned. However, standardization of the methodology and biomarkers are needed
to clarify the link between prebiotics, probiotics, the gut microbiota, inflammation,
and morbidity.
###### **11.4 Conclusion**

In conclusion, fruits, vegetables, olive oil, fish oil, whole grains, legumes, nuts,
flavonoid-rich green tea, carotenoids, omega-3 fatty acids, and fibre demonstrate
anti-inflammatory effects. Basically, they inhibit TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6 production
by suppressing NF-κB, and they inhibit iNOS and COX activity. Also, they exhibit
anti-inflammatory effects via modification of the gut microbiota, reduced accelerated senescence of cells, and reduced immunosenesence. According to these mechanisms, these foods promote the prevention of chronic diseases such as diabetes,
cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases, which underpin
inflammageing and ageing. However, the studies have mostly been in vitro and animal
model studies. Thus, there is a need for more prospective and clinical studies on antiinflammatory food components and food. Moreover, it is important to consider the
dietary pattern to evaluate anti-inflammatory effects of foods from a wider perspective. Even though there are scarce human studies on benefits of these potential
anti-inflammatory effects in ageing and longevity, adopting a Mediterranean dietary
pattern and recommended consumption amounts can be suggested.

##### **Chapter 12**
#### **Nutraceuticals and Functional Foods** **in Aging and Aging-Associated Diseases**

**Jatinder Pal Singh, Balwinder Singh, and Amritpal Kaur**

**Abstract** Aging results in a gradual decline in the physiological functions of the
body and is often accompanied by aging-associated diseases, which may have a
great impact on the quality of life. Allopathic medicines are prescribed to alleviate
the symptoms, but their use is associated with plenty of side effects and high cost.
Recently, nutraceuticals and functional foods market has boomed and caught attention of the general public owing to their medicinal properties and health benefits,
especially in safeguarding and treating chronic diseases. Nutraceuticals can be classified into phenolic compounds, carotenoids, organosulfur compounds, polyunsaturated fatty acids, minerals and vitamins that are useful in decelerating aging process
and preventing aging-associated diseases. Nutraceuticals act mainly by boosting
the immune system against cellular oxidation, improving the balance of gut flora
and lowering blood cholesterol levels. Moreover, they may enhance health span
by preventing/slowing down age-associated diseases such as Parkinson’s disease,
Alzheimer’s disease, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis
and cancer.

###### **12.1 Introduction**

Nutraceuticals can be defined as foods or any of their part which can supply medicinal or health benefits, mostly safeguarding and treating diseases (Chiu et al. 2018;
Vaclavik et al. 2021), so this term incorporates fortified/functional foods and their J. P. Singh · A. Kaur ( B )

nutrients (Ghosh et al. 2012). Nutraceuticals include a range of products from isolated
nutrients (such as ω-3 fatty acids, β-carotene, gingerol, glucosamine, curcumin,
ginseng, lycopene and folic acid), health supplements, herbal products or natural
bioactive foods (such as garlic/green tea/soybeans) (Dominguez Diaz et al. 2020).
Functional foods maybe described as a category of nutraceuticals as they also provide
health benefits apart from nutrition. These foods are categorized as fortified, enriched,
altered and enhanced products. Popular functional foods include margarine with
incorporated phytosterols, yoghurt containing beneficial bacteria, fortified vitamins,
mineral and fiber rich fruit juices (Longoria-García et al. 2018). Nutraceuticals and
functional foods may be used to tackle the growing prevalence of chronic diseases,
especially aging-associated diseases worldwide (Tang 2020).
Aging can be defined as a natural biological process that is associated with a
gradual decline in the physiological functions and an increased vulnerability to
diseases and mortality. The major aging-associated diseases include neurological
disorders such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, cardiovascular disease such
as atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis and cancer. The conventional therapies for aging-associated diseases usually have many side effects and are costly
as well. Since these diseases have been associated with unhealthy dietary habits,
foods which impart positive health benefits besides their nutritional values may be
an answer to prevent the onset of these diseases.
The rising interest in healthy diets has significantly impacted the direction of
research for product development in the areas of nutraceuticals, functional foods
and nanotechnology. Therefore, many pharmaceutical and nutritional products-based
corporations have brought nutraceuticals and functional foods into the market owing
to their property of not only having a nutritional value but also their therapeutic
potential (Vaclavik et al. 2021). The health promoting effects of nutraceuticals and
functional foods have been comprehensively described by many recent studies in
literature (Grumezescu 2016; McWilliams 2017; Rajasekaran 2017; Pandareesh et al.
2018). Taking leads from the aforementioned knowledge, the purpose of this review
article is to emphasize the role of nutraceuticals and functional foods in decelerating
the aging process and preventing the incidence of aging-associated diseases.
###### **12.2 Classes of Nutraceuticals/Functional Foods,** **Extraction and Their Delivery**

Nutraceuticals and functional foods are categorized according to their chemical constituents into phenolic compounds, carotenoids, organosulfur compounds,
polyunsaturated fatty acids, minerals and vitamins that are useful in preventing and
alleviating aging-associated diseases. The major nutraceuticals, their sources and
health promoting as well as anti-aging effects have been presented in Table 12.1.
Phenolic compounds, carotenoids and organosulfur compounds are also termed as
phytochemicals/phytonutrients because they are primarily synthesized in plants.

Phenolic compounds are the nutraceuticals and bioactive components of the
diet which play an important role in good health and are further categorized as
phenolic acids, flavonoids, tannins and lignins (Singh et al. 2016). The important
phenolic compounds that act as nutraceuticals are presented in Fig. 12.1. Quercetin,
naringenin, apigenin, kaempferol, genistein, cyanidin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate and

catechin are flavonoids (the largest class of phenolic compounds), while caffeic
acid, curcumin and resveratrol are non-flavonoid phenolic compounds. Phenolic
compounds can regulate the activity of many enzymes and cell receptors, such as in
case of cancer they may inhibit enzymes which promote cell division or upregulate
enzymes causing cell apoptosis (Rajasekaran 2017). Functional foods such as fruits,
vegetables, herbs, nuts, tea and coffee contain adequate levels of these compounds
(Singh et al. 2020).
Carotenoids are a vast group of hydrophobic pigments that are naturally produced
inplants, algae, bacteria, and fungi. These compounds are carotenes or xanthophylls
depending on their chemical structures (Rodriguez-Amaya 2015). The structures
of major carotenoids acting as nutraceuticals is illustrated in Fig. 12.2. Lycopene,
α-carotene and β-carotene are carotenes, while lutein, zeaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin,
astaxanthin and fucoxanthin are xanthophylls. One of the most important carotenoid
pigments is lycopene (red in color) and has been recognized to have potent activities
against aging-associated diseases (Chaudhary et al. 2018).

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids) are an essential class of
nutraceuticals important for human beings (Falinska et al. 2012). The structures of
main polyunsaturated fatty acids are depicted in Fig. 12.3. Among these, linoleic acid,
γ-linolenic acid, dihomo γ-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid are ω-6 fatty acids, while
α-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic
acid are ω-3 fatty acids. ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids are processed by the identical
enzymes and compete with each other for the enzyme active sites. Both ω-3 and ω-6
fatty acids produce compounds called eicosanoids during metabolism. Eicosanoids
have been known to have anti-inflammatory roles (Saini and Keum 2018).
Organosulfur compounds are organic compounds containing sulfur in their chemical structures. These compounds are primarily present in cruciferous vegetables
(especially broccoli, cauliflower, garlic, and onion). They can be further classified
asallylic sulfur compoundssuch as aliin and allicin (present in garlic and onions),
glucosinolates, isothiocyanates and indoles (Dwivedi et al. 2020).
Minerals can also act as nutraceuticals and are classified as macrominerals and
trace minerals. Macrominerals are required in larger amounts than trace minerals and
include calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride and sulfur.
On the other hand, trace minerals include iron, manganese, copper, iodine, zinc,

cobalt, fluoride and selenium. Vitaminsare another class of nutraceuticals that have a
complex organic structure and are required in small levels for a good human health.
Fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and water-soluble vitamins are the two different
classes of vitamins. Water soluble vitamins include vitamin B and C having very
important roles in the human body.
Apart from the aforementioned classes of nutraceuticals and functional foods,
probiotics and prebiotics can be recognized as functional foods. Probiotics are
health-promoting bacteria present in dairy products such as yogurt. *Lactobacillus*
*acidophilus*, *L. bulgaricus, Bifidobacteriumlactis,* and *B. subtilis* are common examples of probiotic bacteria (Parker and Pace 2016). On the other hand, prebiotics (such
as fructooligosaccharide, inulin, and honey) are ingredients that increase the growth
of health-promoting bacteria.
Nutraceuticals are extracted from living sources by various methods and techniques. These include Soxhlet extraction (traditional method requiring good amounts
of solvent and is time consuming), sonication assisted extraction (use of ultrasound extractor), supercritical fluid extraction and microwave assisted extraction (Grumezescu 2016). After extraction, nutraceuticals are characterized by
different analytical techniques such as high-performance liquid chromatography,
mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance and atomic spectroscopy.
Nutraceuticals often have low dispersibility in water and bioavailability (amount
of nutraceutical that reaches the systemic circulation after consumption) (Singh
et al. 2018; Tang 2020). Therefore, to reduce these limitation various delivery
methods have been used recently. These include phospholipid-based delivery vehicles, liposome-based carrier system, and emulsion-based delivery system (such
as microemulsions, nano emulsions, and double emulsions) (Grumezescu 2016).
Nanoencapsulation is an emerging technique for not only improving the water
dispersibility of nutraceuticals but also their bioavailability (Acevedo-Fani et al.
2017). Nano complexation (complexation of a nutraceutical with proteins at nanoscale) can be helpful for poorly soluble compounds such as curcumin (Singh 2007),
while nano emulsions can also play an important role for improving solubility
(Zhang et al. 2020). Apart from these, other latest developments for better delivery
and bioavailability of nutraceuticals involve electrospinning and electro spraying
techniques (do Evangelho et al. 2019; Coelho et al. 2020).
###### **12.3 Current State of Knowledge About** **Nutraceuticals/Functional Foods**

Nutraceuticals and functional foods can have a plant or animal origin, and the current
research is primarily focused on understanding the mechanism of action, safety
concerns and efficacy. Interestingly, nutraceuticals can be a boon for the treatment
of long-term diseases in patients which do not qualify for a treatment by pharmaceuticals. Moreover, these substances may impact the health in a complicated


-----

228 J. P. Singh et al.

and interactive manner. The current research on nutraceuticals has highlighted the
need of newer processing methods and techniques (such as high-pressure processing
and pulsed electric field processing) for nutraceuticals, so that they can not only
have good microstructures but also acceptable sensory characteristics. Apart from
this, newer packaging methods for nutraceuticals include the use of nanomaterials
that can enhance their safety and efficacy without compromising bioavailability.
Nutraceuticals and functional foods are suitable candidates for personalized nutrition which aims to provide health benefitting diets to people according to their genetic
traits (especially for the prevention of aging-associated diseases) (Corzo et al. 2020).
However, it must be realized that only nutrition without regular physical exercise
cannot guarantee a long and robust life. Additionally, it needs to emphasized that
nutraceuticals and functional foods are not substitutes for a healthy diet. With their
increased advertising, many elderly people have started using health supplements
which have nutraceutical claims but sometimes these supplements are deficient in
what the labels claim. A healthy diet itself contains these nutraceuticals in balanced
amounts, so the idea of healthy nutrition should never be neglected.
###### **12.4 Role of Nutraceuticals/Functional Foods in Delaying** **the Aging Process**

At present, the major goal of gerontology research is to discover natural chemicals
that can modulate aging process. These compounds can be helpful either in suppression of senescent cells or their clearance. Among these, molecules having antioxidant
or anti-inflammatory activities have received considerable interest in the recent years
(Gur˘au et al. 2018). The use of nutraceuticals and functional foods in the diet has
been considered as a promising approach against the aging process, especially in
alleviating the impairment of body functions (Singh et al. 2021). However, as of now
nutraceutical supplementation to reverse the aging process is very challenging, owing
to the dosage as well as timing optimization and different individual responses. It
has been widely recognized that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and whole grains
can be effective because of the presence of adequate amounts of nutraceuticals.
Ferrari (2004) has comprehensively highlighted the roles of nutraceuticals and
functional foods in delaying the progression of aging. He reported that these
compounds can act as mitochondrial membrane stabilizers and enhancers, have
metal chelating and antioxidant properties, and induce apoptosis of senescent cells.
Apart from these, some nutraceuticals such as epigallocatechin gallate, allantoin
and ginsenoside can mimic the anti-aging properties of metformin and rapamycin
(anti-aging drugs) (Aliper et al. 2017). Moreover, nutraceuticals can decelerate aging
process by improving the balance of gut flora and lowering blood cholesterol levels.
The molecular mechanisms of their action have been reported to be by modulating
the gene expression, modifying patterns of DNA methylation and acting as epigenetic modifiers (Lee et al. 2014). It has been validated that free radical clearance can


-----

12 Nutraceuticals and Functional Foods in Aging… 229

be effectively enhanced by using nutraceuticals at adequate levels (Pisoschi and Pop
2015).
There have been many reports of nutraceuticals and functional foods in delaying
the process of aging. Phytochemicals, probiotic bacteria and ω-3 fatty acids have been
reported to have anti-cellular senescence capacity in the immune cells which affect
aging (O’Shea et al. 2009). Flavonoids, along with other phenolic compounds, can
protect against oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids present in the membranes and
circumvent mitochondrial membrane disruptions (Pisoschi and Pop 2015). In terms
of molecular events, foods rich in phenolic compounds can effectively modulate
the activity of some enzymes such as DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylases, which may be responsible for delaying the aging process (Gur˘au et al. 2018).
ω-3 fatty acids have been documented to enhance mitochondrial membrane lipids,
lower calcium release and pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme activity (O’Shea et al,
2009). Nutraceuticals that function as antioxidants can regulate the mitochondrial
functioning and lower the release of cytochrome c for apoptosis (Adachi and Ishii
2002). Nutraceutical microelements such as copper, manganese, and iron function as
enzyme co-factors for antioxidant enzymes such as catalase and superoxide dismutase. This activity is responsible for clearance of free radicals responsible for early
aging.
###### **12.5 Nutraceuticals and Functional Foods Role** **in Reducing Aging-Associated Diseases**

It is well established that aging is responsible for the start and progression of
several diseases, that mainly include neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s and
Alzheimer’s disease, cardiovascular disease such as atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes
mellitus diabetes, osteoarthritis and cancer (Hou et al. 2019; Yang et al. 2020).
Aging progresses with malfunctioning in nutrient signaling, protein machinery and
mitochondria and leads to cell senescence (Saraswat and Rizvi 2017). Neurological
disorders in the elderly people cause changes in both the structural and biochemical
functions of the brain. Owing to these changes, patients demonstrate many symptoms
such as paralysis, muscle weakness, improper coordination, seizures, pain and loss of
consciousness(Fonseca-SantosandChorilli 2020).Otherdiseasessuchasatherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus diabetes, osteoarthritis and cancer also result from the
physiological changes during aging. The roles of nutraceuticals and functional foods
in reducing the incidence of aging-associated diseases is as follows:

###### ***12.5.1 Parkinson’s Disease***

Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease that affects around 1–2% of the
world population (Khan et al. 2019). The usual treatment of Parkinson’s disease
involves providing dopamine replacement therapy. The combination medication
of levodopa and carbidopa is generally used for the patients suffering from this
disease. Nutraceuticals have recently gained a lot of attention because of their therapeutic properties, so an integrative use of nutraceuticals and functional foods along
with the standard therapy of medication has been proven to be effective in many
cases of Parkinson’s disease (Lama et al. 2020). This addition can have an important role in improving the quality of life of the suffering patients. Nutraceuticals
and functional foods generally are helpful in this disease by targeting and weakening various pathogenic events which include neuroinflammation, mitochondrial
dysfunction, apoptosis and oxidative stress. Oxidative stress in Parkinson’s disease
manifests by forming α-synuclein aggregates and lowering amounts of neuromelanin
(Knörle2018; Ludtmann et al. 2018). The biggest role played by nutraceuticals is
to restore mitochondrial homeostasis by reducing oxidative stress and correct faulty
electron transport chain as well as mitochondrial dynamics.
Many nutraceuticals have been investigated to alleviate the symptoms of
Parkinson’s disease. Among phenolic compounds, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (a
major phenolic compound in tea plant) has shown a neuroprotective role because of
its ability to cross the blood–brain barrier. Based on having a catechol-like structure, it
has been described as a good radical scavenger and chelator of iron ions (Morgan and
Grundmann 2017). Moreover, it also encourages the proper folding of α-synuclein
monomers into stable oligomers in a concentration-dependent manner (Šneideris
et al. 2015). Another phenolic compounds under investigation include curcumin
and resveratrol. Curcumin reduces the incidence of nuclear factor κ-B (a family of
inducible transcription factors) mediated neuroinflammation and targets Toll-like
receptor-4 (known to modulate immune responses as well as stimulate synthesis of
inflammatory chemokines and cytokines) (Zhu et al. 2014). Resveratrol has been
reported to restrict mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in nigrostriatal cells
by acting through the protein kinase B/glycogen synthase kinase-3β pathway (Zeng
et al. 2017). In a study by Ho and Pasinetti (2010), grape seed polyphenol extract was
reported to be helpful in the reducing the incidence of Parkinson’s disease that involve
misfolded proteins. This was due to its ability to interfere with the development of
misfolded-protein aggregates generated from Aβ peptides.
Lycopene has been documented to relieve oxidative stress, increase NADH dehydrogenase and superoxide dismutase activity in the corpus striatum and lower
malondialdehyde levels (Prema et al. 2015). In addition, it also enhances the
amounts of other antioxidant enzymes, such as catalase and glutathione peroxidase
in animal as well as cellular models of Parkinson’s disease (Kaur et al. 2011; Paul
et al. 2020). Coenzyme Q10 prevents1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP)-induced neurotoxicity and blocks the electron transfer between complex
1 and other complexes of the electron transport chain (Cleren et al. 2008). Niacin

(vitamin B3) is a precursor of NAD–NADH and is needed for producing dopamine
and may be helpful for managing Parkinson’s disease. Its effects include reduction in inflammation through NIARC1-associated mechanisms, enhancing the ratio
of NAD/NADH, reestablishing complex 1 functioning and boosting dopamine
synthesis in the striatum via the supply of NADPH to mitochondria (Bjørklund
et al. 2020). Ginsenosides restrict astrogliosis as well as microgliosis and reduce
the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines in substantia nigra pars compacta (Fu
et al. 2015). Probiotics can be helpful in restoring gut dysbiosis taking place during
Parkinson’s disease, improving gastrointestinal functioning, decreasing the enteric
nervous system neuroinflammation and gut leakiness (Castelli et al.2020). In a recent
study by Ma et al. (2020), peptides present in sesame cake reduced α-synuclein
aggregation and reduced MPP+ -induced dopaminergic neuron degeneration.
###### ***12.5.2 Alzheimer’s Disease***

Alzheimer’s disease is a neurological disorder which leads to loss of hippocampal and
cortical neurons and clinically exhibits impairment of the cognitive capabilities along
with aphasia, disorientation, and disinhibition (Scheltens et al. 2016). Nutraceuticals
and functional foods have a role to play in reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.
Phenolic compounds have been reported to be effective against this disease and act
as antioxidants (Singh et al. 2016). Curcumin has been reported to lessen the assemblage of Aβpeptides in the neural tissue and its associated inflammation. He et al.
(2016) reported that oral in take of curcumin can reduce the deposition and oligomerization of Aβ peptide, together with phosphorylation of the tau protein. In addition,
curcumin can bind with metal ions, primarily Cu (II) and Zn (II), that are common in
the central nervous system (especially in the synapse regions), adding to its neuroprotective activity (Sadhukhan et al. 2018). Genistein has the potential to reduce the
activity of DNA topoisomerase as well as tyrosine protein kinase (Sadhukhan et al.
2018). Moreover, it has specificity for epidermal growth factor receptor, which is a
growth regulatory transmembrane protein binding certain protein such as epidermal
growth factor and transforming growth factor-β. Many phenolic moieties in the
molecular structure of genistein leads to its good antioxidant activity. Resveratrol
activates reactive protein kinase C that might stimulate α-secretase and result in
lowering of Aβ synthesis, thereby increasing the intracellular free-radical scavenger
glutathione amounts and lowering malondialdehyde and acetylcholinesterase levels
(Han et al. 2004; Fonseca-Santos and Chorilli 2020). Carotenoids such as lycopene
can stop the activities of the secretases (responsible for the processing of amyloid
precursor protein) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β, which leads to neuroprotection in Alzheimer’s disease (Paul et al. 2020). Fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic
acid intake enhances the cognitive function and reduces the incidence of dementia
(Cunnane et al. 2009). Additionally, eicosapentaenoic acid also has been reported to
have a good role in the normal brain development (Cunnane et al. 2009).

###### ***12.5.3 Cardiovascular Disease***

Cardiovascular disease is one major cause of death worldwide, becoming a significant healthcare problem in the developed countries (Sacks et al. 2017). The underlying cause of cardiovascular disease is atherosclerosis (a long-term inflammatory
ailment of medium and large arteries). Taking this into consideration, prevention of
atherosclerosis is the key target for lessening the risk of developing cardiovascular
diseases. Nutraceuticals and functional foods can have a significant role in controlling
atherosclerosis, especially during the promotion stage when circulating monocytes
penetrate vascular endothelial cells and later differentiate into macrophages and foam
cells. Among these compounds, catechin class of flavanols present in cocoa as well
as green tea have been well researched and are well known for their antioxidant activities along with capacity to reduce inflammation by reducing release of cytokines
and chemokines from the activated endothelial cells (Mangels and Mohler 2017).
Curcumin has been reported to lower the levels of C-reactive protein (produced by
the liver during inflammation and is the indicator of atherosclerosis) not only in
animal models but also in humans (Sahebkar 2014). Carotenoid pigment lycopene
has been documented to lower the amounts of low-density lipoproteins as well as
pro-inflammatory cytokines in humans (Cheng et al. 2017; Chaudhary et al. 2018).
Apart from these, phytosterols have also been reported to reduce atherosclerosisin
mouse models and humans by lowering blood plasma low-density lipoprotein levels
(Rocha et al. 2016). Fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid is known to reduce the amounts
of serum triglycerides without enhancing the amounts of low-density lipoproteins in
the body (Ballantyne et al. 2012). Yan et al. (2020) have reported that the nutraceutical Coenzyme Q10 decreased atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice
and enhanced the efflux of cholesterol in humans. ***12.5.4 Type 2 Diabetes***

The conventional treatment of type 2 diabetes often involves many strategies which
can be diet control, exercise, administration of insulin and drugs. Apart from
these strategies, nutraceuticals and functional foods are generally utilized as an
adjuvant/alternative therapy, in combination with relevant changes in the lifestyle.
Many nutraceuticals and functional foods are known to ameliorate the symptoms of
diabetes. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (a catechin present in good levels in green tea)
has significant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities (Singh et al. 2018). The
administration of epigallocatechin-3-gallate on streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats
has been reported to reduce glucose as well as lipid amounts, along with enhancement in insulin concentration. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate has also been reported
to reduce troponin T level, lactate dehydrogenase, and aspartate aminotransferase
enzyme activities in the serum (Othman et al. 2017). Monounsaturated fatty acids
and polyunsaturated fatty acids (as components of olive oil and nuts) have been


-----

12 Nutraceuticals and Functional Foods in Aging… 233

documented to improve glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity and blood lipids in
patients suffering from this disease (Mirabelli et al. 2020). The supplementation
of chromium (as chromium histidinate) in the diet lowered the amounts of glucose,
glycosylatedhemoglobin,andtotalcholesterolinstreptozotocin-induceddiabeticrats
(Ulas et al. 2015). Similarly, administration with zinc (a constituent of insulin and
insulin receptors), decreased oxidative damage and inflammation in the kidneys of
streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (Tang et al. 2010). Garg (2016) reported that
cinnamonas a supplement had a good role to play in managing type 2 diabetes.
###### ***12.5.5 Osteoarthritis***

Osteoarthritis is the most prevalent form of arthritis that accounts for about half of the
total cases, with other ones being rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and lupus (Wang et al.
2018). The conventional medical therapy includes oral and topical non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs but these can be toxic to the body producing rashes, increasing
bleeding risk and can affect kidney functioning. Nutraceuticals and functional foods
can be effective in reducing osteoarthritis pain. Epigallocatechin gallate has an
anti-inflammatory activity on osteoarthritis chondrocytes by lowering the synthesis
of important inflammatory mediators such as inducible nitric oxide synthase and
prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (Henrotin et al. 2011). Curcumin has been
reported to play the role of an antioxidant, chondroprotective and anti-inflammatory
agent (Kuptniratsaikul et al. 2009). Within a month of trials, the patients who were
administered turmeric extracts (at 2 g per day dose) had a significant reduction
in pain in comparison to those who took ibuprofen. In addition, their pain on level
walking as well on stairs decreased over time. Procyanidins, particularly Procyanidin
B2, have exhibited suppression of articular cartilage vascular endothelial growth
factor (a signaling protein which induces new blood vessel growth), a key mediator of osteoarthritis pathogenesis as well as pain (Wang et al. 2018). Fatty acids
such aseicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid have demonstrated antiinflammatory effects (Henrotin et al. 2011). In case of animal models, vitamin C
stimulated the metabolism of chondrocytes, collagen, and proteoglycan synthesis,
whilevitaminEwasreportedtohavefreeradicalscavengingproperties(Lopez 2012).
Functional foods such as green tea and fish oil have been conventionally recognized
for their pain management activities in osteoarthritis patients (Schell et al. 2017).
Moreover, functional foods are often enriched with natural active ingredients that
can reduce pain and inflammation. ***12.5.6 Cancer***

Chemotherapy although is mainstream therapy for cancer but its usage has failed
to achieve its maximum therapeutic potency. Because of the presence of acquired

and intrinsic chemoresistance. There are many side effects of chemotherapy such as
reduced immunity, loss of digestive tract lining along with hair loss (Nair et al. 2020).
Nutraceuticals and functional foods can be helpful for the cancer patients especially
for the management of adverse effects of chemotherapy.
Phenolic compounds such as curcumin has been reported as a potential chemo
preventive and chemosensitizer agent among nutraceutical compounds because of its
high efficacy (Mao et al. 2018). Puliyappadamba et al. (2015) have comprehensively
reported the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activity of curcumin in lung cancer.
Resveratrol has been reported to reduce inflammation, oxidative stress and multistep tumorigenesis. It has been documented to be a chemo preventive and chemo
sensitizing agent against breast cancer (Nair et al. 2020). Genistein has the property
of being effective in lowering the growth of cancer cells without any side effects.
Quercetin has been reported to enhance immune system response against tumor
growth by increasing mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Another nutraceutical named Polyphenon E (a green tea catechin mixture) has been successful in clinical trials against cancer cells proliferation (Zhang et al. 2004). Apart from phenolic
compounds, lycopene has been effective against cancer by suppressing the phosphorylation of tumor suppressor p53 and stopping tumor cell division (Nair et al.
2020).
###### **12.6 Conclusion**

There is a conclusive evidence that the consumption of nutraceuticals and functional
foods have health benefits and might keep aging-associated diseases at bay. However,
more extensive research needs to be done in order to comprehensively demonstrate whether nutraceuticals and functional foods can successfully delay aging in
humans. Moreover, the present limitations of nutraceuticals such as slow metabolism,
poor solubility and reduced bioavailability needs more consideration. Despite of the
present limitations, the future of nutraceuticals of both plant and animal origin holds
exciting opportunities for the food and pharmaceutical industry to create novel products. There is a need to establish efficacy and safety parameters which comply with
the regulatory requirements for maintaining consumer confidence.

crosstalk between ROS production by mitochondria and longevity pathways modulating lifespan across species thus ensuring healthy aging. Nrf2-dependent pathways
of cellular stress response with their target antioxidant *vitagenes* are emerging as
powerful systems capable to preserve redox homeostasis under environmental and
metabolic stresses. *Vitagenes* encode redox longevity genes induced by oxidative
damage including heat shock family (Hsp) Hsp32, Hsp70, glutathione, thioredoxin
and sirtuin protein systems. During aging process, a gradual decline of the heat
shock response occurs and this may prevent repair of protein damage. Therefore,
there is a growing interest by scientific community in developing of novel preventive

chronic degenerative diseases. The specialattention of this paper is focusedonpotential neuroprotective mechanisms of nutrition, in particular dietary polyphenols
involved in the activation of *vitagenes* resulting in improved intracellular antioxidant defense systems against ROS damage leading to degeneration and death with
considerable impact on brain health and longevity processes.

###### **13.1 Introduction**

With the development of novel technologies and pharmacological interventions
during last decades synergistic approaches based on the integration between Chinese
and Western Medicine have emerged to preserve human brain health. The scientific
community, recently, is spending consistent resources to prevent and combat aging
and chronic degenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson
disease (PD) and cancer. Despite the best efforts of biomedical research resulting into
promising outcomes by the sequencing of the human chromosomal single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), and the identification of regional clusters of chromosomal
SNPs (the HapMap) the underlying molecular mechanismsand genetic causes of the
age-related diseases remain still elusive, while their incidence and morbidity either
are continually increasing (Calabrese et al. 2006a; 2006b; 2006c; 2006d; Lodi et al.

Mancuso et al. 2006a).
Aging is a highly complex process that encloses several vulnerabilities including
environmental stressors, epigenetic alterations, mitochondrial deregulation and
chronic inflammation. Interestingly, genetic and mitochondrial biology are being
recognized as powerful candidate for expanding anatomical and mendelian
paradigms to contribute to both accelerated and decelerated cellular or organismal
aging (Mancuso et al. 2006b; Calabrese et al. 2007a, 2007b; Piroddi et al. 2007).The
evolution of life requiresthe interplay between structure andmitochondrial energy
and low environmental stressors as well. The endosymbiotic theoryexplains the
origin of the eukaryotic cell from a glycolytic motile cell, which gave rise to the
nucleus-cytosol, and an oxidative α-proteobacterium, which evolved into the mitochondrion about 2 billion years ago. Hence, these ancestral symbiotic mitochondrial
events generate new insights on the evolutionary origin of aging. The discordance
between cellular quiescence and mitochondrial proliferation results in cellular oxidative stress, ultimately leading to a gradual decline in host cell performance and
age-related pathology. Therefore, aging evolved from a prominent conflict between
maintenance of a normal quiescentstate and the evolutionarily conserved proliferative program driving the life cycle of mitochondria. In this light, mitochondrial
energy is involvedfor lifeprocesses (Calabrese et al. 2007c, 2007d, 2007e, 2008a,
2008i; Athanasiou et al. 2007; Mancuso et al. 2007, 2008). Notably, in response
to various environmental stressors, the cell employs oxidative phosphorylation and
increasestheflowofelectronsthroughmitochondrialelectrontransportsystem(ETS)
to generate a proton motive force and the extra ATP energy needed to defend and
repair the cell from ROS facilitating healthy aging (Calabrese et al. 2011b). Emerging
research focused its attention on dietary interventions or healthy nutrients targeting
the mechanisms of brain aging to prevent neurodegenerative diseases (Flanagan et al.
2020; Miquel et al. 2018). According to the nutritional approach, existing evidence
indicates that some nutrients or food ingredients, in particular specific vitamins,
flavonoids and long chain ω-3 fatty acids have a potential to beneficially affect brain
function (Samieri et al. 2018; Scarmeas et al. 2018).
It is noteworthy that an unhealthy lifestyle or poor nutrient intake can accelerate
epigenetic aging. In contrast, healthy lifestyle and appropriate dietary supplementation delays biological age and the onset of chronic cognitive diseases (Quach et al.
2017). Therefore, there is now an increasing interest in how harmful lifestyle factors
can be modified by bioactive nutrients or foods from the Mediterranean diet (MD)
to prevent cognitive decline and generally improve health over the lifespan. One
of the most recentrandomized studies conducted in Spain were the PREDIMED
(Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea) studies investigating the impact of MD on
human health (Estruch et al. 2018). Particularly, MD with extra-virgin olive oil was
associated with higher scores of global brain performance following the 6.5 years
nutritional intervention (Martinez-Lapiscina et al. 2013). Likewise, the NU-AGE
study (“New dietary strategies addressing the specific needs of elderly population
for healthy ageing in Europe”) based on Mediterranean-style diet pattern improved
brain health and quality of life by counteracting the deleterious effects of chronic

inflammation and age-related cognitive decline in a total of 1250 older adults (aged
65–79) (Santoroet al. 2014). Thesepromisingoutcomes areencouragedfromarecent
ongoingtrial “MedEx-UK”designedtotest theefficacyof MDinterventionandphysical activity as strategies to facilitate healthy brain ageing and reduce dementia risk
in older adults (Shannon et al. 2021). Accordingly, higher adherence to MD over the
year-long intervention was associated with statistically significant improvements to
prevent the progression of cognitive decline and dementia compared to older adults
with lower adherence (Marseglia et al. 2018). Notwithstanding, brain health benefits
of this diet, further studies are needed to confirm the application and feasibility of
the MD across the different European regions (Berendsen et al. 2018).
Currently, a great number of *in vitro* studies showed the capacity of nutritional
polyphenols to modulate not only the expression of genes but also miRNA, proteins
and other regulators of cell function, such as cell stress response pathways inducing
epigenetic modifications to achieve healthy ageing (Claude et al. 2014; Vauzour
et al. 2017). Moreover, experimental studies on animal models demonstrated that
genetic and epigenetic manipulations as well asantioxidant polyphenols and caloric
restriction (CR) improve brain health and extend maximal lifespan within the context
of hormetic dose response.Specifically, CR appears to extend lifespan by reducing
reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidative damage. Indeed, low levels of
ROS are positively implicated in the induction of many sensitive signal transduction
cascades, thataretightly regulated by a complex network of cellular stress response
pathways. Benefits of hormetic stimuli, such as the antioxidant supplementation and
energy restriction lead to low ROS formation that escape from the mitochondrial
electron transport chain and act as sensing signaling molecules to promote longevity
signaling pathways, including *vitagenes* which are genes involved in preserving
cellular redox homeostasis during stressful conditions. *Vitagenes* encode for heat
shock proteins (Hsp) Hsp32, Hsp70, γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, thioredoxin and
sirtuins as biomarkers for stress adaptation, cross-tolerance and biological resilience
underlying hormesis or preconditioning (Calabrese et al. 2011b). Importantly, antioxidant polyphenolsshowed to be neuroprotective through the activation of hormetic
Nrf2-dependent pathways, including *vitagenes* . The hormesis concept asserts that
low doses of a great diversity of environmental challenges (i.e. caloric restriction
and antioxidant polyphenols) at a long-standing affect animal and human health
prolonging lifespan and represent potential preventive and therapeutic strategies for
chronic degenerative disorders (Calabrese et al. 2011a). Given the significance of
cytoprotective properties of Nrf2-vitagene pathwaythere is now a strong interest in
discovering and developing novel preventive and pharmacological agents capable of
inducing hormetic stress response. In this review we discuss the most current and
up to date understanding of the potential signaling mechanisms by caloric restriction, as well antioxidant polyphenols that activating *vitagenes* can enhance intracellular defensive systems involved in bioenergetic and cellular stress homeostasis with
consequent impact on brain health and longevity processes (Calabrese et al. 2008b,
2008c, 2008d, 2008e, 2008f, 2008g; Di Renzo et al. 2008).

###### **13.2 Hydroxytyrosol/hidrox® A Prototypical Polyphenolic** **Agent for Brain Health** ***13.2.1 Hydroxytyrosol/Hidrox®***

Emerging research has recently focused on brain health benefits of the major olive
oil polyphenols, particularly hydroxytyrosol (HT) and hydroxytyrosol (HT)-rich
aqueous olive pulp extract (Hidrox®), that at low doses exert multiple preventive
and pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory (Bitler et al. 2005), antioxidant (Bellumori et al. 2019), anti-aging (Di Rosa et al. 2020) and anti-proliferative
effects in vitro and in vivo (Luo et al. 2013; Imran et al. 2018) Fig. 13.1. Aging
is currently recognized as a multifactorial process involving diverse and complex

**Fig. 13.1** Modulation of Nrf2-vitagene pathway by antioxidant polyphenols for brain health during
aging.Under physiological conditions, Nrf2 is bound to its repressor Keap1 and is restricted to the
cytosol where it undergoes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation via association with the
Cul3-Rbx1 based E3/ubiquitin ligase complex. Under stress condition, Nrf2 is released from Keap1
and it is translocated into the nucleus where it binds to the phase 2 of ARE in heterodimeric combination with Maf transcription factor in the DNA promoter region. Dysregulation of autophagy flux
leading to p62 activation, an autophagy adaptor protein, which accumulates and sequesters Keap1
into autophagosomes for degradation. Consequently, Keap1 can no longer bind Nrf2, inducing
an upregulation of Nrf2 pathway and related target genes. Moreover, antioxidant polyphenols are
small molecules that at low dose reverse oxidative stress and inflammation by activating Nrf2 nuclear
translocation and transcription (phase 2) of *vitagenes* . The upregulation of vitagene pathway such
as HO-1, Hsp70, Trx, Sirt1, NQO1, γ-GCS induces neuroprotection andsuccessful aging. Nuclear

alterations including mitochondrial dysfunction, epigenetic alterations, deregulated
nutrient sensing. Recent exhaustive evidence in the literature indicated as olive oil
polyphenols significantly modulate the aging process, so tightly connected to oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. Thus, notable attention is paid to the antiinflammatory and brain health effects of Hidrox® produced by harvesting it from
an olive oil production by-product, the olive vegetation water (OVW or olive juice),
and normally discarded as wastewater with an excellent safety profile, high bioavailability, tissue distribution and multiple mechanisms (Soni et al. 2006). Among the
phenolic compounds, hydroxytyrosol (50–70%) represents the main constituent of
the pulp extract, while other polyphenols present include oleuropein (5–10%), tyrosol
(0.3%),oleuropeinaglyconeandgallicacid.TheprocessdevelopedbyCreAgri,Incis
both solvent-free and environmentally friendly, employs citric acid (1%) for the mild
acidic hydrolysis of the naturally occurring hydroxytyrosol esters and produces HT
concentration ranging from 20 g/kg to 50 g/kg olive dry matter (Soni et al. 2006).
Preclinical studies showed that HT efficiently exerts radical scavenging activities
in vitro and significantly increases the expression of antioxidant enzymes extending
lifespan in in vivo models of aging (Visioli et al. 1998; Rietjens et al. 2007; Luo et al.
2019; Calabrese et al. 2016). Of relevance, Bitler and coworkers (2005) demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effects of OVW obtained during olive oil milling, and
containing 25 mg HT/g solid, (HT is > 45% of the total polyphenols). Other phytochemicals present in Hidrox® include apigenin, luteolin and elenolic acid. In this
study, Hidrox® was administered in powder form (freeze dried OVW) to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated BALB/c mice by oral gavage. Therefore, OVW and HT were
testedattwodifferentconcentrationsfortheirabilitytoinhibittheproductionofTNFα, a primary cytokine involved in progression of inflammatory process. It has been
observed that OVW at a dose of 125 mg/mouse (500 mg/kg) reduced serum TNFalphalevelsby95%.Also,inthehumanmonocytecellline(THP-1)OVWsuppressed
LPS-induced TNF-α production by 50% at a concentration of 0.5 g/L (equivalent to
approximately 0.03 g/L simple and polyphenols). OVW did not cause toxic effects
in all of the experiments investigated. When OVW was combined with glucosamine,
a component of proteoglycans and glycoproteins, their synergistic effects decreased
the inducible nitric oxide synthase production in macrophage cells and serum TNFα levels in the LPS-treated mice (Bliter et al. 2005). Interestingly, purified HT, in
comparison, did not induce any reduction of TNF-α, in any of these experiments.
Given the important role of HT in inflammatory signaling, the protective mechanism
of HT includes, lastly the activation of the NF-κβ signaling cascades occurring in
aging and chronic inflammatory diseases (Killen et al. 2014).
The beneficial effects of Hidrox® were confirmed by an in vitro study conducted
by researchers at DSM (Basel) in 2011 (Richard et al. 2011). They used fractionated OVW to identify its anti-inflammatory constituents of the natural formulation. The fractions obtained by preparative HPLC were tested on macrophages
(RAW264.7 cells) stimulated with LPS to evaluate their effect on the inhibition of
inflammatory mediators (i.e. NO and PGE2, cytokines, interleukins and chemokines)
in a hormetic dose–response manner, thereby supporting that HT exerts its antiinflammatory effects, at least in part, mediated via the NF-kB cellular pathway.

The authors, however, indicated the potential synergistic/complementary action of
unknown compounds present in the OVW. In addition, other in vitro studies on
endothelial cells (Scoditti et al. 2014) and human monocytic cell line (Zhang et al.
2009) have highlighted the ability of HT to downregulate NF-kB activation and its
translocation into the nucleus. Furthermore, animal studies have shown the safety
profile of Hidrox®, since given by oral gavage to rats did not appear induce reproductive and developmental toxicity at the maximum dose of 2000 mg/kg/day (Christian
et al. 2004). Consistent with the substantial studies above reported and based upon
to the high safety profile of the OVW formulation (GRAS certification was obtained
by CreAgri in 2004), human studies demonstrated that HT, in the form of freeze dry
powder, orally administered in 4 capsules/day to 90 patients affected by osteo and
rheumatoid arthritis induced a potent anti-inflammatory activity manifested as reduction of swelling, pain and improved daily motilities with an associated reduction of
two inflammation biomarkers, CRP and homocysteine (Bitler et al. 2007). Other
clinical trials tested hydroxytyrosol, in its natural environment (OVW, Olivenol™or
Hidrox®), on 100 healthy volunteers in Malaysia (Visioli et al. 2009) and 50 patients
in Japan (Numano et al. 2007). In the first study, a single dose (2 ml OWV, 2.5 mg HT)
administered orally significantly increased total (reduced and oxidized) glutathione
antioxidant levels in plasma. Although the authors did not observe any difference
of total antioxidant capacity in the blood. The second study conducted in Japan
included patients with high cholesterol levels and confirmed the protective effect of
olive polyphenols and HT on lipid profile. Doses as low as 5 mg HT/day produced a
remarkable reduction of high MW cholesterol (VDL fraction 3, 4 and 5) while HDL
cholesterol concentration was unchanged or improved (Visioli et al. 2009). Surprisingly, in this study the same HT dosage of 5–10 mg/daily carried out important
improvements in 5 patients with skin disorders (psoriasis purulenta, atopic, allergic
and seborrheic dermatitis), this could explain a potential protective effect of HT on
the immune system (Numano et al. 2007). Consistent with this line of evidence, our
research group published recent in vivo studies with olive polyphenols, in particular,
Hidrox® that exerts higher anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects than the
same amount of pure HT, improving overall of healthspan and longevity as well as
stress resistance in a rotenone-stressed PD model of C. elegans and rodents (Brunetti
et al. 2020; Di Rosa et al. 2020; Siracusa et al. 2020).
Additionally, recent double-blinded randomized preclinical studies indicated the
neuroprotective effect of HT-enriched diet, in particular a dose of 45 mg HT/kg
BW/day favors the recovery after ischemic stroke by improving stroke-associated
learning and motor impairments. This effect is probably associated to an increase
cerebral blood flow (CBF). Also, this study showed that HT induces an increase of
functional and structural connectivity by enhancing transcription of the postsynaptic
density protein 95 (Psd-95) marker, an anti-inflammatory activity by reducing ionized
calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA-1) level as well as a neurogenic potential
by raising the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in mice (Calahorra et al. 2019). In addition, increasing evidence reported the brain health benefits
of HT supplementation that at a dose of (50 mg/kg of diet) improved cognitive
functions and reduced Aβ42 and pE3-Aβ plaque in the cortex of TgCRND8 mice

(Nardiello et al. 2018). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that aged mice display
a downregulation of Sirt1, CREB, Gap43, and GPx-1 gene expression in the brain
tissue. In this way, supplementation of diet rich in olive polyphenols at a dose range
of 1 to 10 mg/kg has positive long-term effects on cognition and energy metabolism
in the aged brain (Reutzel et al. 2018). Finally, a recent interesting evidence has
demonstrated the virucidal activity of Hidrox® at a dose of 20 mg/kg by inactivating
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in time
and concentration dependently, proving once again that Hidrox® is more potent than
of pure HT (Takeda et al. 2021).
###### ***13.2.2 Tracking the Polyphenols Metabolic Fate in Human*** ***Tissues***

The presence of polyphenols and related chemicals (compounds) in plants shows
great variability in both quality and quantity. These plant secondary metabolites constitute one of the most diverse and widely distributed groups of natural
compounds. Their metabolism is also quite variable and not always fully understood. Many of them are also present in plants as glycosides that, after human ingestion, are hydrolyzed by intestinal enzymes and/or microflora in the colon to the
corresponding aglycones (Ozdal et al. 2016; Giovinazzo et al. 2015). The phenolic
compounds that are taken up into the bloodstream undergo rapid o-glucuronidation,
o-sulphonation and o-methylation in the liver (Cassidy et al. 2017). In these conjugated forms, polyphenols are found as the first metabolites in the plasma and then,
by the action of the intestinal microbiome, they are fragmented into smaller phenolic
acids which can be re-directed into the bloodstream and also excreted in the urine

(Crozier et al. 2009). Not surprisingly, the degree of absorption, metabolism, conjugation, and excretion of polyphenols has been found to be highly variable both within
and between individuals (Bondia-Pons et al. 2014). If we add to the above that the
bioactivities of polyphenols are widely varied, it follows that it is essential, both in
the therapeutic as well as toxicological studies, to be able to perform detailed investigations on the bioavailability, metabolism, and fate of these compounds possibly
in those that are the target tissues in humans or at least in related organoid systems.
Thus, regardless of the purpose of the study, it is necessary to be provided with
sensitivemethods that canmonitor, inblood(deVilliers et al. 2012), as well as inother
tissues or biofluids, both specific phenolic compounds or their metabolites and, more
ingeneral, aphenolicprofile. Unlikethedeterminationof thetotal polyphenol content
in a generic natural source extract, which is mainly carried out by spectrophotometric
assay, the analysis of specific polyphenols that may be found in human tissues (or
even organoids) samples requires the separation of the individual polyphenol species,
which is commonly performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
or capillary electrophoresis (CE), and their subsequent detection by different detectors (UV–vis, mass spectrometry). Coupling HPLC, or rather UPLC (ultra-high


-----

13 Food for Brain Health 247

performance liquid chromatography), with mass spectrometry is nowadays a fairly
sensitive analytical procedure that allows to obtain also structural information on
single analytes and, in some instances, the elucidation of their structure.Prior to the
introduction of UPLC, capillary electrophoresis (CE) received substantial attention
as an alternative to the HPLC separation method; this was because the resulting
separations were often faster and more efficient than the corresponding HPLC separations and because CE allows in one run the analysis of polyphenol compounds with
different nature.However, compared to current standard UPLC methods, CE methods
generally suffer from lower sensitivity and robustness and are therefore mainly used
in that analytical fields where it still provides actual advantage over liquid chromatography, such as in chiral separation (Sun et al. 2012). When mass spectrometry
is used for the identification of analytes after their separation, the choice of the analyte
ionization mode turns out to be crucial to unambiguously identify molecular ions
and their fragments. In particular, for the characterization of anthocyanin glycosides
in the presence of the corresponding flavonol glycosides, it was proposed to apply
the negative ionization mode as an alternative to the usual positive ionization mode;
indeed, the MS spectra acquired in the negative ionization mode have been shown
a valuable tool for differentiating anthocyanins from non-anthocyanin polyphenols
(Olech et al. 2020a). An important issue in the UPLC-MS analysis of polyphenols
is their quantification. The content of antioxidant metabolites in a given extract can
be determined by UPLC-ESI–MS/MS analysis. In this case the triple quadrupole
MS detector is operated in MRM (Multiple Reaction Monitoring) scan mode, which
ensures high sensitivity and selectivity of the analysis (Elessawy et al. 2020). This
technique allows you to quickly distinguish compounds that have the same parent
ions (same molecular weight) but give different fragment ions (Olech et al. 2020b;
Adebooye et al. 2018). Combining a specific mass of a precursor ion with the equally
specific mass of one of its product ions is generally an unambiguous and sensitive
method to selectively track and quantitate a compound of interest. Since two stages
of mass selection are utilized, MRM assays are particularly useful for the specific
analysis of target compounds in complex mixtures and matrices, such as tissue or
organoid extracts. This is why MRM mode has become the preferred method for the
quantitative analysis of known or target compounds. An additional aspect to account
for in wanting to track polyphenols in human tissues or organoids concerns the step of
extracting them from these tissues before proceeding to their qualitative and/or quantitative analysis. Differently from the analysis of polyphenols in plant extracts or food
products (Ajila et al. 2011; van Duynhovena et al. 2011), standardized procedures for
the preparation, extraction, and analysis of tissue (or organoid) samples from human
sources are not yet available. Of the methods offered in the current literature (Yang
et al. 2019; Shafaei et al. 2019), each may have specific advantages toward the extraction and detection of certain polyphenolic compounds and this must be accounted
for prior to analysis. Since it is not uncommon that the choice of a given analytical
procedure does not meet all the requirements of a specific experimental investigation, the best approach to characterize the polyphenolic composition of a sample of
human tissues (or biofluids) may at present be to use an appropriate combination of
different analytical assays.

###### **13.3 The Hormesis Paradigm and Nrf-2 Dependent** **Vitagene System in Aging and Longevity** ***13.3.1 Cellular Stress Response, HSF Biology*** ***and the Vitagene Network***

Cellular stress response is recognized as the ability of a cell to counteract stressful
challenges and restore redox homeostasis during aging process (Fig. 13.1). This intracellular mechanism requires the activation of stress adaptive response pathways, in
particulartheNrf2signalingpathwaythatregulatesthetranscriptionofcytoprotective
genes termed *vitagenes* (Calabrese et al. 2010b; Calabrese et al. 2012f) including prosurvival molecules such as heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), heme oxygenase-1 (HO1), glutathione, sirtuins and the thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase system (Calabrese
et al. 2008g; Bellia et al. 2011; Di Paola et al. 2011; Pennisi et al. 2011; Scapagnini
et al. 2011) endowed with anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic activities. In this context,
Heat shock response (HSR), represents an evolutionarily conserved cell defense
mechanism suitably orchestrate to ensure health of the proteome and successful
aging (Calabrese et al. 2008h, 2008i 2009a, 2009b, 2009c, 2009d, 2010a, 2010b;
Bellia et al. 2009). The production of heat shock proteins, including molecular chaperones, is essential for the folding and repair of damaged proteins, serving thus to
maintain protein homeostasis and are critical to cell survival during proteotoxic stress
(De Lorenzo et al. 2010; Calabrese et al. 2010c, 2010d, 2010e; Di Domenico et al.
2010; Perluigi et al. 2010; Calabrese et al. 2010a). Several lines of evidence have
shown that HSR contributes to establishing a cytoprotective state in a wide range
of human diseases, including inflammation, cancer, aging and neurodegenerative
disorders (Siciliano et al. 2011). Therefore, there is now strong interest in discovering and developing novel pharmacological agents capable of inducing the HSR to
prevent misfolding, aggregation, and proteome mismanagement during aging and
related cognitive disorders (Zhang et al. 2011; Westerheide et al. 2012). Heat shock
transcription factors (HSFs), vitally important for all organisms to survive to acute
or chronic proteotoxic stress, exert also a crucial role for normal development and
lifespan-enhancing pathways by expanding the HSF target range well beyond the
heat shock genes. Consistent with this observation, HSFs targeting cellular stress
response genes and regulate their ubiquitous expression at the transcriptional, translational and post-translational levels, while they are maintained in an inactive state
under physiological conditions (Calabrese et al. 2012a, 2012b). Mammalian HSF
family consists of four members: HSF1, HSF2, HSF3 and HSF4, which recognize by
binding the heat shock element (HSE), composed of inverted repeats of a pentameric
consensus nGAAn sequence. HSF1 is a master transcriptional regulator of HSR
in humans and invertebrates (i.e., Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, and yeast),
whereas HSF-2, -3, and -4 are expressed in vertebrates and exhibit several functional
propertiesintheregulationofstressandlifespan.ThesedistinctHSFsareregulatedby

proteasomal degradation and small-molecule activators and inhibitors. In addition to
thermal stress, the inducible expression of heat shock proteins (i.e., Hsp27, Hsp40,
Hsp70 and Hsp90) is also triggered by environmental redox alterations or exposure to ROS electrophiles which cause trimerization and phosphorylation of DNA
binding of HSF1 resulting in accumulation into the nucleus where it binds HSE
for the transcription of stress responsive genes, thus pointing to the importance of
the cysteine redox state for the maintenance of this transcription factor in its active
control state (Calabrese et al. 2012a). Likewise of other transcription factors, HSFs
are composed of functional domains which have been well characterized for HSF1.
The DNA-binding domain (DBD) is a signature domain highly conserved of HSFs for
recognition of target-genes that contains a helix-turn-helix motif and intermolecular
interactions of the hydrophobic heptad repeats (HR-A/B) forming coiled coil, characteristic for many leucine zippers (Fujimoto et al. 2010). The reversible conversion
of HSF-1 from monomer to trimer involves respectively the transition from the inert
state in which the intramolecular coiled-coil formed by the amino-terminal HR-A/B
interacts with the carboxy-terminal heptad (HR-C) located between the regulatory
and trans-activation domains (TADs), to the functional state comprising only intermolecularHR-A/Binteractions.Thetrans-activationdomaininallHSFsispositioned
at the amino terminal region, and is composed of two bipartite modules—AD1 and
AD2, which are rich in hydrophobic and acidic residues allowing rapid and prolonged
response to a wide range of stressors (Fujimoto et al. 2010). Therefore, the N-terminal
domains of HSF1 mediate trimerization and acquisition of DNA-binding ability and
are concentration dependent, whereas the C-terminal domains of the protein facilitate
transcriptional activation of stress target genes and also upregulate HSF1 (Calabrese
et al. 2012a; Fujimoto et al. 2010). HSF1 possesses an intrinsic thermosensing role
modulated via posttranslational modifications (Calabrese et al. 2011b; Fujimoto et al.
2010). Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 activity has emerged as a
potential target in treating neurodegenerative diseases especially AD and PD. In this
context, recent evidence showed that the inhibition of Hsp90 by geldanamycin and
its derivatives converts HSF1 into a DNA-binding trimeric state in cells suppressing
atypical neuronal activity and improving protein aggregation and its related toxicity
via the induction of HSP70 in AD. On the other hand, HSF1 is maintained in an
inactive monomeric state by the interaction with Hsp90 in non-stressed cells (Alam
et al. 2017). In the activation cycle, HSF1 undergoes extensive post translational
modifications, such as phosphorylation, sumoylation and acetylation. Specifically,
under unstressed conditions HSF1 is a monomeric phosphoprotein on several serine
residues. Upon stress, phosphorylation on serine 303 which is located within the
regulatory domain (RD) of HSF1 is required for sumoylation. SUMO proteins are
transiently and covalently bound to a specific site at lysine 298 residues of multiple
cellular proteins. The sumoylation mechanism described for the first time in HSF1
occurs on a consensus sequence consisting of the tetrapeptide *�* KxE, where *�*
is represented by a branched hydrophobic amino acid and K the SUMO acceptor
that presents the phosphorylation-dependent sumoylation motif (PDSM), mediating
sumoylation.TheacetylationcoincideswiththeattenuationphaseoftheHSF1activation cycle. Accordingly, acetylation of HSF1 is modulated by the functional balance

of acetylation by histone acetyl-transferase E1A binding protein (p300) and deacetylation by the NAD [+] -dependent sirtuin, SIRT1. The upregulation of the deacetylase
and longevity factor SIRT1 enhances and prolongs the HSF1 binding to the human
HSP70 promoter maintaining it in a competent state. Conversely, downregulation
of SIRT1 enhances the acetylation of HSF1 and the attenuation of DNA-binding
without affecting the formation of HSF1 trimers (Calabrese et al. 2011b). It is noteworthy that SIRT1 is also implicated in caloric restriction and aging as well as in
lifespan extension. Indeed, the age-dependent loss of SIRT1 and deregulated HSF1
activity leads to impairment of the heat shock response and proteostasis in senescent
cells, thus connecting the heat shock response to nutrition and aging (Calabrese et al.
2011b). Emerging research is focusing growing interest on pharmacological or nutritional antioxidant therapy based on the current knowledge of the protective potential
of small-molecule activators and inhibitors modulated by HSF1 including *vitagenes*
(i.e., Hsp90, Hsp70 and SIRT1) (Calabrese et al. 2010a; Akerfelt et al. 2012; Fujimoto et al. 2010). Recent evidence demonstrated that dietary supplementation with
vitamin C (1 g) significantly ameliorated the detrimental effects of heat stress on liver,
heart and kidney tissues of chickens at cellular and molecular levels by upregulation
of heat shock proteins (HSP60, HSP70 and HSP90), heat shock factors (HSF-1 and
HSF-3) and enzymatic antioxidants such as malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide
dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPX),
catalase (CAT) (Albokhadaim et al. 2019). Moreover, it has been reported that resveratrol exerts potent anti-inflammatory activity and viral eradication by increasing the
expression of HSF1, SIRT1 and p53 in vitro and in vivo (Wang et al. 2017; Zeng
et al. 2017). Importantly, subsequent preclinical studies revealed that treatment with
celastrol (a quinone methide triterpenoid) induces hyperphosphorylation of HSF1,
enhanced binding of HSF1 to the HSE and transcriptional activation of endogenous
heat shock genes in a similar manner to that induced by heat shock stress (Westerheide et al. 2004). Further studies have suggested that functional inhibition of Hsp90
by celastrol may be the initial event that triggers dissociation of HSF1 from the heat
shock complex (Salminen et al. 2010; Hieronymus et al. 2006). It is interesting to
note that antioxidant sulforaphane contained in broccoli (Brassica oleracea), induces
nuclear accumulation of HSF1 and activation of heat shock response through the
upregulation of Hsp27 in several cell culture models, including human cell lines,
as well as in animals after a single oral dose of 10 μm of the isothiocyanate (Gan
et al. 2010). Inflammation caused by microglial activation induces adaptive immune
responses by producing pro-inflammatory mediators, including nuclear factor (NF)κB, caspase-3, HSF1 and consequently increased release of HSP60. Consistent with
this, curcumin at a dose of 5 μg/ml markedly inhibits microglial activation by downregulation of HSF1 and reduced HSP60 expression in cells (Ding et al. 2016). Lastly,
recent evidence reported that chlorogenic acid, a polyphenol distributed in plants and
plant-derived food, exerts antioxidant and protective activities against cell stress in
hormetic heat conditions. Particularly, chlorogenic acid confers thermal stress tolerance and autophagy by the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) mediated
by HSF1 and HSP-70/HSP-16 in C. elegans (Carranza et al. 2020).

In addition to HSFs some of the vitagenes are also upregulated within the “phase
2 response”, known as “the electrophile counterattack response”, a cytoprotective
response that protects against various electrophiles and oxidants (Athanasiou et al.
2007; Mancuso et al. 2007; Calabrese et al. 2008a; Mancuso et al. 2008) (Fig. 13.1).
Examples include heme oxygenase 1, thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase, all of
whichcanbeupregulatedbythetranscriptionfactorNrf2(Nuclearerythroid2-related
factor 2) co-ordinately with a battery of cytoprotective proteins, such as glutathione
transferases (GST), UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), epoxide hydrolase, ferritin, γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase,
glutathione reductase, aldo–keto reductases, and glutathione conjugate efflux pumps
(Athanasiou et al. 2007; Mancuso et al. 2007; Calabrese et al. 2008a; Mancuso et al.
2008). This elaborate network of protective mechanisms allows eukaryotic organisms to counteract the damaging effects of oxidants and electrophiles, major agents
involvedinthepathogenesisofcancer,atherosclerosis,neurodegeneration,andaging.
The gene expression of these cytoprotective proteins is coordinately regulated by a
common molecular mechanism that involves the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE pathway. The
upstream regulatory regions of these genes contain single or multiple copies of
the antioxidant/electrophile response elements (ARE, EpRE) with the consensus
sequence 5’-A/CTGAC/GNNNGCA/G-3’).
The major transcription factor that binds to the ARE is nuclear factor erythroid 2related factor 2 (Nrf2), a basic leucine zipper transcription factor. Activation of gene
expression requires that Nrf2 binds to the ARE in heterodimeric combinations with
members of the small Maf family of transcription factors. Under basal conditions
the pathway operates at low levels due to the repressor function of the cytosolic
protein Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), which binds to the E3 ubiquitin
ligase Cullin3-RING box1 (Cul3-Rbx1) and presents Nrf2 for ubiquitination and
subsequent proteosomal degradation.
Vitagenes, containing in its promoter region the antioxidant response element
(ARE), there has been a growing interest over the last years in the heme oxygenase
(HO) system, the family of enzymes that control the initial and rate-limiting steps
in heme catabolism (Athanasiou et al. 2007; Mancuso et al. 2007; Calabrese et al.
2008a; Mancuso et al. 2008). The heme oxygenases have been recognized as dynamic
sensors of cellular oxidative stress and modulators of redox homeostasis throughout
the phylogenetic spectrum. Heme oxygenases are located within the endoplasmic
reticulum where they act in association with NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase to
oxidize heme to biliverdin, free ferrous iron and carbon monoxide (CO). Biliverdin
reductasefurthercatabolizesbiliverdintothebilepigment,bilirubin,alineartetrapyrrole which has been shown to effectively counteract nitrosative stress due to its ability
to interact with nitric oxide (NO) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) (Athanasiou
et al. 2007; Mancuso et al. 2006b; Calabrese et al. 2008a; Mancuso et al. 2008).
Bilirubin is then conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted (Athanasiou et al.
2007; Mancuso et al. 2006b; Calabrese et al. 2008a; Mancuso et al. 2008). Bilirubin
has been shown to serve as an endogenous scavenger for both NO and RNS, which
may alter the redox status of the cell and originate the nitrosative stress (Athanasiou
et al. 2007; Mancuso et al. 2006b; Calabrese et al. 2008a; Mancuso et al. 2008).

252 V. Calabrese et al.

Despite this important antioxidant properties, if produced in excess, as in the case of
haemolytic anaemia or sepsis, unconjugated bilirubin becomes neurotoxic through
multiple mechanisms involving the disruption of cell membrane structure, the reduction of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and the activation of the apoptotic
cascade (Athanasiou et al. 2007; Mancuso et al. 2006b; Calabrese et al. 2008a;
Mancuso et al. 2008). Mammalian cells express at least two isoforms of heme oxygenase: HO-1 and HO-2. A third protein, HO-3, is determined to be a retrotransposition
of the HO-2 gene (pseudogene) and has been found unique to rats. Although HO-1
and HO-2 catalyze the same reaction, they play different roles in protecting tissues
against injury.
A convincing hypothesis suggests that HO-1 induction is one of the earlier cellular
response to tissue damage and is responsible for the rapid clearance of the intracellular pro-oxidant heme and its transformation into CO and biliverdin, the latter being
the precursor of the antioxidant bilirubin (Fig. 13.1). On the contrary, constitutively
expressed HO-2 is primarily involved in maintaining cellular heme homeostasis as
well as in the sensing of intracellular levels of gaseous compounds including NO
and CO. Due to the antioxidant response element (ARE) contained in its promoter
region, redox regulation of HO-1 gene is now well defined (Athanasiou et al. 2007;
Mancuso et al. 2006b; Calabrese et al. 2008a; Mancuso et al. 2008). HO-1, in
fact, can be induced by several stimuli associated with oxidative and/or nitrosative
stress, such as heme, Aβ, dopamine analogues, H 2 O 2, hyperoxia, UV light, heavy
metals, prostaglandins, NO, peroxynitrite, Th1 cytokines, oxidized lipid products
and lipopolysaccharide, as well as certain growth factors.
In this light, very promising ROS scavangers are the polyphenolic compounds
contained in some herbs and spices, e.g., curcumin. Curcumin is the active antioxidant principle in *Curcuma longa*, a colouring agent and food additive commonly
used in Indian culinary preparations. This polyphenolic substance has the potential to
inhibit lipid peroxidation and to effectively intercept and neutralize ROS and RNS. In
addition, curcumin has been shown to significantly increase HO-1 in astrocytes and
vascular endothelial cells. This latter effect on HO-1 can explain, at least in part, the
anti-oxidant properties of curcumin, in particular keeping in mind that HO-1-derived
bilirubin has the ability to scavenge both ROS and RNS. Epidemiological studies
suggested that curcumin, as one of the most prevalent nutritional and medicinal
compounds used by the Indian population, is responsible for the significantly reduced
(4.4- fold) prevalence of AD in India compared to United States (Mancuso et al. 2008;
Scapagnini et al. 2011; Westerheide et al. 2012).
Based on these findings, Lim and colleagues have provided convincing evidence
that dietary curcumin given to an AD transgenic APPSw mouse model (Tg2576) for
6 months resulted in a suppression of indices of inflammation and oxidative damage
in the brain of these mice (Song et al. 2012). Furthermore, increasing evidence
indicates that curcumin inhibits NFkB activation, efficiently preventing cell death
(Begum et al. 2008; Gupta et al. 2011; Di Renzo et al. 2012). Whereas the acute
induction of this enzyme in neural and other tissues is predominantly cytoprotective

many chronic degenerative and neuroinflammatory conditions long after provocative stimuli initiation. Within this context, heme-derived free ferrous iron, CO, and
biliverdin/bilirubin are all biologically active substances that can either ameliorate
or exacerbate neural injury contingently to the specific disease conditions, such as
intensity and duration of HO-1 expression and/or the nature of the resulting redox
milieu. In ‘stressed’ astroglia, HO-1 hyperactivity promotes mitochondrial sequestration of non-transferrin iron and macroautophagy and may thereby contribute to
the pathological iron deposition and bioenergetic failure found in most age-related
oxidant neurodegenerative disorders. Glial HO-1 expression may impact also cell
survival and neuroplasticity by modulating brain sterol metabolism and proteosomal
degradation of neurotoxic protein aggregates (Calabrese et al. 2012a).
###### ***13.3.2 Hormetics Compounds and Redoxomics***

Nutraceutical compounds that trigger the hormetic response are called “hormetins”
*(see the chapter on nutritional hormetins in this book).* Their hormetic mechanisms in
ageing is to help the endogenous redox equilibrium to avoid imbalances. Hormetins
are found in many fruits and vegetables as form of product of their secondary (or
specialized) metabolism. Examples of hormetins are for example, group C and E vitamins, flavonoids, anthocyanins and other antioxidant polyphenols (resveratrol, gallic
acid, etc.) (Calabrese et al.2012e), microminerals such as selenium and zinc which
havebeenshowntoinduceatypicalhormeticdose–response(Hayes 2007).Thebenefits of hormetins are obtained through mitigation of the oxidative stress pathways as
maintenance and repair of DNA damage pathways and antioxidant protection pathways (Rattan 2008). Powerful life–prolonging properties were achieved with feeding
various phytochemical at low dosage in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans
(Cypser et al. 2002).
Cysteine nitrosylation is rapidly reverted to reduced cysteine in vitro and in vivo
by spontaneous non-chemical reduction operated by vitamin C (ascorbic acid).
Anyway, since cysteine nitrosylation is part of the unfolded protein response, UPR,
(Uehara et al. 2006), vitamin C as hermetic compound might delay or jeopardize
the UPR. Nevertheless, in redox proteomics which uses SDS-PAGE to visualize
the nitrosylated proteins at cysteine level a powerful technique is the biotin switch
method (Forrester et al. 2009). In brief, in vitro, cellular protein lysates containing
S-nitrosylated cysteines and not are first blocked in their reduced cysteines with Smethylthiolationagent, S-methylmethanethiosulfonate(MMTS). Secondarily, ascorbate is used to remove the nitro group from cysteines (SNO) to obtain a free thiol
(trans-nitrosation reaction) and the byproduct O-nitroso-ascorbate. Free cysteines
are then biotinylated with biotin-HPDP via disulfide exchange mechanism. Biotinylated proteins are affinity captured by streptavidin-agarose, eluted and analyzed by
SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting. Nowadays, omics techniques can use label free single
or multiplex cysteine isobaric labelling compounds to monitor and compare different
samples at the same time (Pan et al. 2014; McDonagh et al. 2014) **.**

In facts, using iodoacetyl-based Cys-reactive isobaric tags as high throughput
methods (iodoTMT 6-plex,), quantitative cysteine proteome was detected in H9c2,
rat cardiomyocytes, showing differences in multiplexed redox samples treated with
normoxia or hypoxia in the absence and presence of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO)
(Pan et al. 2014).Adult and old mice skeletal muscle were analyzed by comparative
redox proteomics showing a decrease in redox-responsive proteins in aged skeletal
muscle (McDonagh et al. 2014). Oxidation of total proteins increased in old mice
skeletal muscle as compared with adult mice ones. Besides the hormetins that are
compounds that ameliorate the oxidative stress, the hermetic compounds instead are
activating, at an experiment level only, called “the hormetic concentration zone”),
the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE pathway: i.e., sulforaphane, curcumin, carnosic acid, dimethyl
fumarate, etc. (Calabrese et al. 2014).
###### ***13.3.3 Hormetic Compounds as Metal Chelatorsand ROS*** ***Scavengers***

Notably is the fact that some of the hormetic compounds acts as direct iron/heavy
metal chelators, e.g., curcumin (Rainey et al. 2019; Balasubramanyam et al. 2003).
Free Fe(II/III) and Cu(II) in the brain originated a ROS cascade by metal catalyzed
oxidationoccurringinneurogenerativeconditions(i.e.,PDandAD).ROScanoxidize
DNA bases and the repair mechanism of DNA is regulated by the so-called base excision/SSB repair (BER/SSBR) pathway which uses base excision activity of NEIL
family DNA glycosylases (Hegde et al. 2010). Transition metals, hence, generates
both ROS mediate DNA damages and direct inhibition of NEIL type DNA glycosydases (Hegde et al. 2011). In this case, curcumin have been proved to act directly as
ROS scavenger and metal chelation preventing DNA glycosidase direct inhibition
(Hegde et al. 2011).
Dietary heme intake coming from excessively consumed red meat can start oxidative damage during oxymyoglobin and deoxymyoglobin heme and cytochrome heme
derived breakdown products (Tappel 2007). Free and coordinated heme in blood or at
intestinelevelcatalyzeoxidativereactions,involvingalsohemecatalyzedlipidperoxidation (Carlin et al. 1988). The role of heme–iron in aging, and neurodegeneration
is the reflection of systemic and local malfunctioning of Fe homeostasis due to iron
overload, considered the main contributor of neurodegenerative diseases (Gozzelino
2016).InvivoexperimentshavebeendemonstratedthatmicefedwithanenrichedFediet senesce faster than those with a restricted Fe diet (Arruda et al. 2013). In the brain
iron is accumulated in the substantia nigra and basal ganglia. Imbalance in iron homeostasis involving these regions of the brain is present in rare human genetic mutation leading to “neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation” (NBIA) disorders
(Wong et al. 2014; Gregory et al. 2013).
As stated above, the catabolism of cellular heme in the brain is mediated by
the isogene 1 of heme oxygenase (HO-1). The isozyme HO-1 contains a C-terminus

PEST (proline-glutamic acid-serine-threonine) domain that rapidly target the protein
to degradation upon the sequence of event that starts with its oxidation, followed by
phosphorylation of PEST domain and ubiquitination and proteasome degradation
(Lin et al. 2008). However, HO-1elevated mRNA and protein level are stimulated
by ROS, and its overexpression in astrocytes increase mitochondrial damage and
mitophagy by enhancing mitochondrial permeability by opening the mitochondrial
permeability transition pore and deviating the flow of oxidative redox species from
the mitochondria to the rest of the cell (Schipper et al. 2015; Zukor et al. 2009).
Even diet containing elevated amount of starch/glucose (high-glucose, HG) can
originate an oxidative stress-dependent Heme Oxygenase-1 de novo mRNA expression determining ultimately neuronal apoptosis (Yang et al. 2017) because HG stimulates extracellular ROS generation via NADPH oxidase activation and mitochondrial
ROS release via opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. NF-κB
and AP-1 transcription factors play a role in HO-1 expression in various cell types
(Hsieh et al. 2010).
Plant derived NF-κB inhibitors and AP-1 inhibitors (Golan-Goldhirsh et al. 2014,
Choy et al. 2019) are known also as ROS scavengers. However, their molecular
involvement in the exact cascade of event upstream or downstream the ROS generating/transduction event need to be established per each phytochemical compound
also generating a nutraceutical effect by testing the concentration range that elicit
an hormetic response. Mouse mesangial cells treated with 25 mM glucose for 24 h
showed increased ROS generation, by upregulation of NADPH oxidase (NOX) 1 and
mitochondrial superoxide (Song et al. 2016). Pretreatment with 50 μM delphinidin
or 1 mM N-acetylcysteine (NAC) suppressed the ROS generation (Song et al. 2016).
Delphinidin is a polyphenol, in particular a flavonoid. Among the flavonoids, the
anthocyanins include besides delphinidin, also cyanidin and pelargonidin. Their
mechanism of action includes both a direct chelation effects of redox generating
metals and direct action of ascorbic acid. In particular, the ascorbic acid (Vit. C) is a
ubiquitous antioxidant of soluble intra e extracellular spaces. It detoxifies activated
oxygen species: acts as an antioxidant either by reducing superoxide, H 2 O 2 and
hydroxyl radicals, or by quenching singlet oxygen. Under exposure to heavy metals,
the levels of the antioxidant power of Vit. C decreases as it is oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid. Metal catalyzed oxidation by Copper (II) or Fe (II) are first chelated
by ascorbic acid dicarboxylic group prior its oxidation. Adding of flavonoids, i.e.,
cyanidin or delphinidin (flavonoids that containing a vicinal ortho-dihydroxy group)
results in a mixed chelation of such metal ions to form a stable metal-anhydro chelate
(flavonoid-metal-ascorbate) (Annamraju et al. 1997). This mechanism is known, e.g.,
inside plant vacuoles, as co-pigmentation, since different classes of flavonoids are
complexing metals to detoxify those, preventing ROS formation (Takeda 2006). In
particular, the blue color of the sepals of many plants are given by the intermolecular
co-pigmentation mechanism in order to detoxify Al [3+] (Takeda 2006). In Hydrangea
(Hydrangea macrophylla), the sepal color can be regulated by the pH of the vacuole
of the sepals, since to get blue color Al3 + is administrated to the roots. Upon translocation into sepals, it is sequestered in the vacuoles as 3-O-glucosyl-delphinidin based

anthocyanins by co-pigmentation with other phenolic acids, e.g., 5-O-caffeoylquinic
acid, 3-O-caffeoylquinic acid and/or 5-O-p-coumaroylquinic acid (Ito et al. 2018).
In mice cardiomyocites, delphinidin administration repressed angiotensin II
induced cardiac hypertrophy by modulating oxidative stress and in particular by
inhibiting the AMPK/NADPH oxidase (NOX)/mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) signaling pathway (Chen et al. 2020). Another anthocyanin, the cyanidin-3O-glucoside (C3G) is known also to have beneficial antioxidant and neuroprotective
effects due to pleiotropic mechanism of actions (Zhang et al. 2019). Anthocyanin
extract improved oxidative damage in HepG2 cells and prolonged the lifespan of
*Caenorhabditis elegans* through MAPK and Nrf2 pathways (Yan et al. 2017).
###### ***13.3.4 Hormetic Compounds: Between Beneficial*** ***Nutraceutical and Pro-oxidative Effects***

However, many polyphenols, including anthocyanins, show the hormetic behavior
of the dose–response phenomenon by the inversion of the response between low
and high doses (Halliwell et al. 2008). Nevertheless, anthocyanins are recognized
as antioxidants and free radical scavengers, they are also able toprovoke *in vivo* prooxidant effects (Laughton et al. 1991, 1989; Sakanoet al. 2005). Among polyphenols, hydroxycinnamic acids (e.g., caffeic acid, catechol, gallic acid, ferulic acid,
o/m/p-coumaric acid and chlorogenic acid) show prooxidant activity and cause DNA
damage (Zheng et al. 2008). In general, the more hydroxyl substitutions in flavonoids,
the stronger will be their antioxidant and prooxidant activities (Cao et al. 1997).
To test the prooxidant activities of several polyphenols the redox system used was
NADPH/peroxidase/H 2 O 2 and DNA cleavage systems (Eghbaliferiz et al. 2016).
Hence, the paradigm for the mechanism of action of polyphenols is from one hand
through direct antioxidant activity, by their interaction with ROS, including both
radical and nonradical oxygen species, such as O 2 **[.]** [−], H 2 O 2, HOCl, NONOO [−] (Noda
et al. 1998; Nakagawa et al. 2002; Tsuda et al. 2000) and from another hand
through their excessive dose abuse that can cause anti-hormetic effects leading to
pro-oxidative reactions, e.g., quercetin, myricetin, kaempferol and caffeic, chlorogenic and ferulic acids (Azam et al. 2004; Watjen et al. 2005; Bouayed et al. 2010).
Lately, the occidental world is re-discovering and validating scientifically the antiageing active ingredients from the Traditional Chinese Medicine, TCM (Shen et al.
2017). Anti-ageing ingredients from herbs or roots are related to plant secondary
or better specialized metabolites: flavonoids, saponins, polysaccharides, alkaloids
and others. Among them, astragaloside, *Cistanche tubulosa* acteoside, Ginsenoside
Rg1, curcumin, resveratrol, carnosic acid and echinacoside possess in our judgement
the best anti-ageing activity. Astragaloside (AST), Cistanche tubulosa acteoside for
example, inhibit the telomerase activity (Guo et al. 2010). Besides, *Cistanche tubu-*
*losa*, a desert plant that paraxitize other’s plant roots, produces also a wide range of


-----

13 Food for Brain Health 257

metabolites containing phenylethanoid glycosides (cistantubuloside A, cistantubuloside B, echinacoside, cistanoside A, acteoside, isoacteoside, 2-acetylacteoside,
cistanoside C and tubuloside), and it has been used in TCM for its many therapeutic effects including neuroprotection and anti-parkinsonian effects (Al-Snafi
2020). Ginsenoside Rg1, markedly decreases telomere shortening, reinforces telomerase activity inhibitor (Zhou et al. 2011). Curcumin, activates signalling pathways
downstream of the anti-ageing modulators AMPK and NRF2, suppress inflammatory
processes mediated by NF-kB signalling (Lim et al. 2001; Salvioli et al. 2007), while
and its derivate, tetrahydrocurcumin,regulates sirtuins and FOXO1-responsive pathways (Argyropoulouet al. 2013). Phenylethanoids are a type of phenolic compounds
characterized by a phenethyl alcohol structure. Tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol are
examples of such compounds. Resveratrol, found in red wine, in yeast increases
cell survival by stimulating SIRT1-dependent deacetylation of p53 (Howitz et al.
2003). Resveratrol, in this case, mimicked calorie restriction by stimulating also
Sir2, increasing DNA stability and extending lifespan by 70% (Howitz et al. 2003).
Carnosic acid, and other phenolic diterpenes, has been identified in many aromatic
plants because protects the chloroplasts from oxidative damage (i.e., drought stress
induced),alongwisecarotenoids,tocopherols,ascorbate,andglutathione/thioredoxin
system (Munnè-Bosch et al. 2003). Carnosic acid, which displays high antioxidant
properties in vitro and in vivo. In facts, carnosic acid could be considered a protecting
agent of brain mitochondria since it activates the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway,
reduce the impact of pro-oxidant agents reduce the ROS by upregulating the Mn-SOD
and increases the GSH levels (de Oliveira 2018). Another hydroxytyrol containing
antioxidant compound is the “oleuropein” (elenolic acid linked to the orthodiphenol
hydroxytyrosol by an ester bond, and to a molecule of glucose by a glycosidic bond)
(Panizzi et al. 1960). Oleuropein is the bitter compound found in green olive skin,
flesh, seeds, and leaves which seems inhibiting α-synuclein (αSN) aggregation and
reducing its tendency to form toxic oligomers, e.g., in neuronal degeneration of
Parkinson’s disease (Mohammad-Beigi et al. 2019). However, in vivo, the fate of
the oleuropein is given by the intestine derived hydrolytic products: 1) esterases can
liberate the hydroxytyrosol and oleoside11-methyl ester glycoside and 2) a glycosidase can also further liberate the glucose. Therefore, it could be that the neuroprotective effect could be explicated by the hydroxytyrosol itself as it is the case of hypoxia
derived injuries in rat brains (Gonzàlez-Correa et al. 2008).
Finally, the anti-aging, neuroprotective, immune system booster, echinacoside
(ECH) a natural phenylethanoid glycoside containing caffeic acid and hydroxytyrosol glycosides, first isolated from Echinacea angustifolia DC, shows a plethora of
ROS scavenging capabilities for the treatment aging (Nematal et al. 2011) and neurological disorders (Liu et al. 2018). ECH is partially hydrolyzed to aglycone in the rat
body and it is found in the rat feces asacteoside, decaffeoylacteoside, lugrandosie,
3,4-dihydrophenyl ethanol (Liu et al. 2018). Several Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s
animal models induced by 6-OHDA, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP), d-galactose and β-amyloid Aβ-(25–35) as well as cerebral ischemia rats
were used to estimate the neuroprotective effects of ECH (Zhao et al. 2016). In these
cases, the ECH effects ranged from downregulating intracellular ROS, the expression

of p38MAPK, caspase 3/8, NFkappaB, p52/p53 and upregulating the level of pERK
MAPK, and SIRT1 (Wang et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2017a, 2017b; Zhang et al. 2014;
Zhu et al. 2011).
###### ***13.3.5 Nrf2/vitagene Pathway: A Crucial Hub*** ***in the Hormesis Paradigm***

In recent decades, a novel cytoprotective panel has emerged suggesting a common
mechanistic framework of hormetic dose responses following the redox activation of
the Nrf2/vitagene signaling pathway to maintain or restore healthy aging (Fig. 13.1).
The hormetic dose-responses are typically defined as overcompensation reactions
to the direct alterations in cellular redox homeostasis by subtoxic or subthreshold
doses of various ubiquitous environmental stressors. Indeed, hormesis-induced overcompensations often enhance cellular resiliency to prevent the occurrence of various
toxic phenotypes, such as aging and aging-related disorders (Calabrese et al. 2018).
According to the hormesis principle, exposure to low concentrations of stressors
such as drugs, ionizing radiation, xenobiotics and natural polyphenols may protect
against neuronal damage from a subsequent stressor agent (ROS), while at higher
dose the toxic effect prevails (Calabrese EJ et al. 2012a, 2012b, 2012c, 2012d, 2021a).
Cellular stressors shift the redox homeostasis of cells toward the oxidative state

and in the process activate Nrf2 redox sensor to mediate a host of cytoprotective
and resiliency responses, including antioxidation, detoxification, anti-inflammation,
autophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis (Amara et al. 2020a; Ahmed et al. 2017). It
is well established that under normal redox state, the repressor Keap1 is bound to Nrf2
sustaining its ubiquitination and degradation into the cytosol, maintaining Nrf2 at
low levels. However, increased exposure to subtoxic hormetic levels of pro-oxidative
stressors cause the oxidization of labile cysteine residues in Keap1 and consequently
the loss of its capacity to mediate Nrf2 for degradation by proteosome. Therefore,
Nrf2 accumulates and translocates into the nucleus where it binds to a region ofantioxidant response elements (ARE) upregulating numerous antioxidant pathways to
restore redox homeostasis (e.g., HO-1, GCLM and GLLC), inhibits inflammation
(TGF-B and NF-kB), and improves xenobiotic metabolism and excretion (NQO1,
AKRIC1, and MRPI), apoptosis (BCL2 and BclxL), and autophagy (p62). Interestingly, transcription factor Nrf2 regulates a wide range of genes termed *vitagenes*
(Calabrese et al. 2020a, 2020b; Scuto et al. 2020; Calabrese et al. 2014) (Fig. 13.1).
The latter encodes for members of HSP family, such as heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1)
and HSP 70, thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase, glutathione and sirtuins (Calabrese
et al. 2012b; Cornelius et al. 2013, 2014; Trovato et al. 2014). Hence, moderate
cellular stressors or inducers (i.e., polyphenols) exert a physiological modulation
of Nrf2 and the activation of longevity *vitagenes* ensuring health benefits and a
prolonged lifespan as well as cellular stress resilience in animal and humans (Pall

et al. 2015; Amara et al. 2020b; Crespo et al. 2015).Accordingly, emerging scientific literature has investigated the dose–response and mechanistic features of some
dietary polyphenols for which potential health benefits in a broad spectrum of neurological diseases have been reported (Leri et al. 2020; Cordaro et al. 2020a, 2020b;
Scuto et al. 2019a). Compelling in vitro and in vivo evidence shown that natural
polyphenols such as curcumin (Scuto et al. 2019b), ginsenoside (Chu et al. 2019),
2,7,2 [′] -trihydroxy-4,4 [′] 7 [′] -trimethoxy-1,1 [′] -bephenanthrene (TTB) (Liu et al. 2019),
berberine (Zhang et al. 2017a, 2017b), resveratrol (Plauth et al. 2016), green tea
(Calabrese EJ et al. 2020a, 2020b) and sulforaphane display hormetic dose–response
and have been receiving increasing attention in the field of neuroscience, including
the areas of neuroprotection, as supplementation to drugs for Parkinson’s disease
(PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Huntington’s disease (HD) and stroke by the activation of Nrf2 pathway (Alfieri et al. 2013; Zhao et al. 2017; Dwivedi et al. 2016). In
line with the extensive evidence above mentioned, pharmacological studies demonstrated that redox environment induced by polyphenols could potentially protect the
cell from oxidative stress during aging-related diseases. Intriguingly, recent preclinical and clinical studies have observed a paradox view of polyphenols that at very
low concentration in the blood system act as pro-drugs generating H 2 O 2 by inducing
redox signaling through Nrf2 axis of cell adaptation and protection of oxidative
stress (Eustress). On the other hand, high concentration of circulating polyphenols,
can generate relatively increased levels of H 2 O 2 and possible other derivatives, acting
as cytotoxic agents affecting inflammation, apoptosis, necrosis and death (Distress)
(Kanner 2020). Consistent with this concept, hormetic low concentrations (<50 μM)
of cellular pro-oxidant resveratrol enhanced pool of endogenous reduced glutathione
(GSH) and Sirt1 expression following the addiction of toxic 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal
(HNE) via activation of the Nrf2 pathway in a concentration dependent manner
(Plauth et al. 2016). Likewise, Calabrese and coworkers also revealed that a subtoxic
dose of < 50 μM of sulforaphane induces chemoprotective effects mediated by the
Nrf2/ARE pathway through a functional crosstalk with p53 and NF-kB pathways
modulating the redox and inflammatory states of cells for potential implications on
public health and clinical medicine (Calabrese EJ et al. 2021b). Furthermore, recent
biomedical literature concerning the hormetic profile reported that sulforaphane activatingNrf2/AREpathwayinducesanupregulationofphaseIIdetoxificationenzymes
and antioxidant genes (e.g., *vitagenes* ) in a wide range of chronic diseases including
cancer and neurological disorders (Wang et al. 2018; Zhao et al. 2018; Calabrese
EJ et al. 2021a, 2021b). Increasing evidence observed that low dose of berberine
(1 μM) exhibitshormetic and neuroprotective effects against 6-hydroxydopamine (6OHDA) and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-inducedneurotoxicity by
up-regulating PI3K/AKT/Bcl-2 cell survival and Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidative signaling
pathways in PC12 cells, rodent and zebrafish models of neurodegeneration (Kwon
et al. 2010; Kim et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2017a, 2017b) (Fig. 13.1). Moreover,
alsoother protective agents can activate Nrf2 pathway, in particular, it has been
observedthatmethyleneblue(MB)preventedrotenone-inducedneurotoxicityaswell

( *iNOS)* in rodent models of neurodegeneration and ulcerative colitis (Gureev et al.
2019; El-Sayed et al. 2019). Several experimental studies focused their interest on the
hormetic role of Nrf2 in mediating radiation toxicity. The early study aboutionizing
radiation was documented by Tsukimoto and coworkers showing that a low dose of
ionizing radiation in the range of 0.1–0.5 Gy increased the cytosolic accumulation of
Nrf2/vitagenesandtheupregulationofGSHandHO-1inmousemacrophages(Tsukimoto et al. 2010). Recent evidence also reported the hormetic role of selenoproteins
as potential radiation mitigators in redox pathways regulating the activity of selenoenzymes such as thioredoxin reductase-1 and glutathione peroxidases (Bartolini
et al. 2020). Mechanistically, Nrf2 activation contribute to 2,2 [′] -diselenyl dibenzoic
acid (DSBA)-induced radioprotection in normal tissue against ionizing radiationinduced toxicity in vitro and in vivo (Bartolini et al. 2015, 2019). Finally, equally
interesting studies demonstrated the radioprotective effects of repeated sulforaphane
dose-dependenttreatment(10 μM)resultinginastrongerNrf2responsewithaparticular upregulation of NQO1 and HO-1 against toxic effects of free radicals induced
by ionizing radiation in human fibroblasts (Mathew et al. 2014). Taken together, the
emerging data above discussed shed light on the hormetic dose–response effects of
many antioxidant agents including natural polyphenols that at low concentrations
modulate Nrf2/vitagene pathway exerting preventive and therapeutic strategies to
preserve health and extend lifespan during aging and age-related illnesses in humans.
###### **13.4 Conclusions and Future Directions**

The role of mitochondria in normal aging has been the focus of extensive research
in the last decades and being complementary to and maturing from the free radical
theory of aging, to the oxidative stress theory of aging, to the mitochondrial oxidative
stress theory of aging, and today addressing the tight co-regulation of mitochondrial
energy and redox signaling. In this scenario, it appears conceivably the function
of the carnitine system as a prototypical vitagene operating at the functional interface of energy distribution between ancestral mechanisms of cell proliferation and
differentiation and homeostatic mitochondrial dependent processes of cell survival
which require energy for cellular stress response and redox homeostasis (Calabrese
et al. 2011b). Very importantly, a new neuroprotective role has been elucidated for
mitochondrial targeted compounds, such as nutritional antioxidants, carnitines or
carnosine, which by intersecting convergent mechanisms that rely on cellular energy
distribution and availability, such as cellular stress response pathways, DNA repair
and molecular fidelity mechanisms improve health brain.In conclusion, the maintenance of optimum antioxidant potential appears be a promising novel therapeutic
approach for those pathophysiological conditions, such as neurodegeneration or
cancer, where hormetic stimulation of the vitagene pathway is strongly warranted.
Maintenance of ROS is mostly depending on caloric metabolism, which is influenced by the diet. Apart metabolic restriction as self-mechanism of reduction in

endogenous ROS production, hormetic compounds can help to induce the antioxidant system by functioning as ROS scavenging compound at optimal dose–response
level (hormetic curve). At higher level the natural antioxidant hormetins can acts as
pro-oxidants, unbalancing the ROS pathways and triggering aging at many levels:
mitochondrial damage leads to apoptosis; telomerase activation leads to shortening
of telomers; DNA damages lead to gene and epigenetic changes that can accelerate
aging or cellular death.
Low dose response to antioxidant compounds cited here lead to the elicitation
of survivor pathway (adaptative responses) helping their direct ROS scavenging
action. In case of sirtuins, the adaptive response involve epigenetics. DNA methylation is involved in epigenetic changes that trigger gene activation/deactivation and
chromatin remodeling. Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) is a class-III histone deacetylase and hence
involved also in chromatin remodeling. Sirtuin-1 activation and inhibition can be one
of the potential treatment targets for diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration
(Calabrese et al. 2018). The hormetic compounds mentioned here have, in their low
dosage administration, beneficial distinct nutraceutical effects depending on their
chemical structure. Anyhow, depending on their hormetic curve dosage response,
their negative pro-oxidative effects are affecting their nutraceutical performances.
Hence future direction could foresee studies investigating their dose–response in
relationship also to their natural or synthetic sources that might alter their biological
function. The more chemical pure nutraceuticals are produced, by organic synthesis
or by system biology, the more unique effects on the activated pathways could be
drawn in a near future research.

##### **Chapter 14**
#### **Nutrition and Exercise to Maintain** **Physical Functioning During Ageing**

**Pol Grootswagers, Marco Mensink, and Lisette de Groot**

**Abstract** During ageing, losses in muscle mass and muscle strength are common.
Unfavourable changes in muscle architecture and neurological activation of muscle
tissue decrease the unit-specific muscular output, also known as muscle quality.
Together, the losses in the muscular domains lead to lower physical functioning and
thereby jeopardise one’s independence and quality of life.
This chapter explains the age-related declines in muscle mass and quality, and how
nutrition and exercise can be strategically used to prevent and counter these declines.
Due attention is given to the role of nutrition and exercise in light of age-related
syndromes and critical life events where muscular losses are accelerated.
##### Keywords Physical functioning · Exercise · Muscle quality · Nutrition · Sarcopenia · Frailty

Together with exercise, good nutrition is key for optimal muscle health and physical
functioning. When people get older, their level of physical functioning becomes an
important factor in their quality of life. The body’s physical condition determines
the level of independence and the activities one can join and is therefore of vital
importance for healthy ageing. Thereby, physical functioning is the foundation of the
extent to which an older person can still be physically, mentally, and socially active.
The aim of this article is to explain how physical functioning normally declines
during ageing and how this decline can be prevented or addressed with nutrition and

###### **14.1 Age-Related Physical Decline**

A high level of physical functioning is hard to maintain throughout ageing. During
ageing, several biological processes have to be fought to preserve as much of the
functional capacities a person has around the age of thirty. Estimations show that
after the age of thirty, people lose around three to eight per cent of muscle mass
every decade (Holloszy 2000, Melton et al. 2000). Such loss implies that if a person
has 35 kg of muscle mass at the age of 30, this person might end up with between
23 and 30 kg muscle mass remaining at the age of 80. One of the reasons for this
age-related loss in muscle mass is a decreased exposure to anabolic stimuli later in
life, such as physical activity (McPhee et al. 2016), protein intake (Tieland et al.
2012a) and anabolic hormones (Morley 2017). Additionally, the anabolic response
to these stimuli is blunted in older people, a phenomenon that is termed anabolic
resistance (Burd et al. 2013).
Underneath this visible muscle mass decline, a change that is less obvious, but
arguably as important, is happening: a declining muscle strength. During ageing,
muscle strength is decreasing at a much faster rate than muscle mass does (Fig. 14.1).
The estimated loss in muscle strength is between 10 and 20% per decade up to the
age of 70 (Hughes et al. 2001) and between 20 and 30% in the decades thereafter
(Goodpaster et al. 2006). The loss in muscle strength is considered a more important
risk factor for functional decline than the loss in muscle mass (Schaap et al. 2013).
Muscle strength might, therefore, be more relevant than muscle mass for quality of
life of older adults. This notion is confirmed by the work of Balogun et al. (Balogun
et al. 2017). They compared community-dwelling older adults in the lowest 20%
of handgrip strength or lower-limb muscle strength with those with normal strength

**Fig. 14.1** Trajectories of
ageing-induced losses in
muscle mass (Holloszy
2000, Melton et al. 2000)
and muscle strength (Hughes
et al. 2001; Goodpaster et al.
2006). Note that the gap

strengths widens over the

levels, and found a significant and clinically meaningful lower health-related quality
of life over ten years of follow-up for those with low strength. The associations
between low appendicular mean mass and health-related quality of life were weaker,
indicating that muscle strength is a stronger determinant of quality of life than muscle
mass (Balogun et al. 2017).
The observation that muscle strength is lost at a higher rate than mass reveals
that muscle function is not solely determined by muscle mass. The functioning of a
muscle beyond its mass can be called muscle quality (Barbat-Artigas et al. 2012). A
pragmatic definition of muscle quality is function per mass and can be calculated as
muscle strength or power per unit of mass, volume or cross-sectional area (BarbatArtigas et al. 2012). A more sophisticated way of evaluating muscle quality is to
examine the determinants of relative muscle strength themselves (Correa-de-Araujo
et al. 2017). Four important determinants of muscle quality are type II muscle fiber
atrophy, mitochondrial functioning, fat infiltration, and neuromuscular activation
(Fig. 14.2). The bottom layer of Fig. 14.2 shows the lifestyle factors that can improve
determinants of muscle quality (explained in part 4).

###### **14.2 Ageing Syndromes**

Over the last decades, several forms of physical dysfunction have been classified
into ageing phenotypes. The most important syndromes that are not always related
to diseases are malnutrition, sarcopenia and frailty. Here, we shortly touch upon these
three phenotypes and describe how they can be addressed via nutritional therapies.
**Malnutrition** is defined as ‘a state resulting from lack of intake or uptake of
nutrition that leads to altered body composition (decreased fat free mass) and body
cell mass leading to diminished physical and mental function and impaired clinical outcome from disease’ (Cederholm et al. 2017) It can be assessed via multiple
screening tools, such as MNA, MST, SNAQ [RC] and NUFFE, which are tailored to
various settings (Power et al. 2018). The estimated prevalence of malnutrition is
11% in community-dwelling older adults (Schilp et al. 2012) and even higher in
more vulnerable populations, with 35% in those receiving home-care (Schilp et al.
2012) and 38% in patients admitted to geriatric wards (Kruizenga et al. 2016). Malnutrition is strongly related to morbidity (Abizanda et al. 2016), mortality (McMinn
et al. 2011) and functional impairments (Kiesswetter et al. 2014).
A clinical nutritional treatment against malnutrition is oral nutritional supplementation (ONS). These supplements contain all macro- and micronutrients and
have shown to be effective in increasing body weight (Milne et al. 2009). Novel
formulations of ONS aim to additionally target the physical condition of patients via
potent nutrients such as whey protein, leucine, HMB, ursolic acid, and vitamin D
(Grootswagers et al. 2018; Deutz et al. 2016; Bauer et al. 2015). These novel formulations have shown promising results on hospital readmission, chair stand test, and
gait speed (Grootswagers et al. 2018; Deutz et al. 2016; Bauer et al. 2015).
**Sarcopenia** is defined as ‘a progressive and generalised skeletal muscle disorder
that is associated with increased likelihood of adverse outcomes including falls,
fractures, physical disability and mortality’ (Cruz-Jentoft et al. 2019). It is prevalent
in an estimated 10% of the older adult population (Shafiee et al. 2017), and has
clear detrimental effects on quality of life and independent living of older adults
(Dos Santos et al. 2017; Franzon et al. 2019; Tsekoura et al. 2017) New guidelines
have put muscle function central in the sarcopenia diagnosis (Cruz-Jentoft et al.
2019), which can be measured as handgrip strength or chair rise test time. Sarcopenia
can also be screened for via the SARC-F questionnaire (Malmstrom et al. 2016).
The recommended treatment of sarcopenia consists of resistance exercise, ideally in
combination with protein or leucine and vitamin D when deficient (Morley 2018,
Morley et al. 2010). Recently, sarcopenia was assigned an ICD-10 code (Anker et al.
2016), which greatly advances the recognition of sarcopenia by the international
medical community.
**Frailty** is defined as ‘A medical syndrome with multiple causes and contributors
that is characterised by diminished strength, endurance, and reduced physiologic
function that increases an individual’s vulnerability for developing increased dependency and/or death (Morley et al. 2013)’ and is prevalent in around 10% in women
and 5% in men (Collard et al. 2012). Frailty is usually assessed by Fried’s criteria


-----

14 Nutrition and Exercise to Maintain Physical Functioning During Ageing 279

(Fried et al. 2001). The distinction between frailty and sarcopenia lies in the multidimensional nature of frailty, covering not only physical declines but also cognitive and
social deteriorations. Treatment options for frailty include physical exercise, protein
and vitamin D (Artaza-Artabe et al. 2016).
Malnutrition, sarcopenia and frailty share common determinants, such as weight
loss and muscle weakness. The overlap in the phenotypes leads to the co-existence
of multiple phenotypes within the same patient (Cederholm 2015). Researchers,
therefore, advised striving towards interventions that treat all three conditions, for
instance, by targeting common risk factors (Verstraeten et al. 2021).
###### **14.3 Critical Life Events**

The gradual course of physical decline, as described in paragraph 1, reflect population means. However, on the individual level, such a gradual decline is most often no
reality. During critical life events, muscle mass, muscle quality and physical functioning can decline rapidly. For instance, during ten days of bed rest, older adults
lose around 1 kg of leg lean mass (Kortebein et al. 2007) and 11% of muscle strength
(Kortebein et al. 2008). Importantly, the acute declines in muscle-related measures
differ between individuals and are strongly related to the patient’s age. For instance,
for the same amount of bed rest, a young individual loses only 25% of what an
older person loses (LeBlanc et al. 1992). The exact reasons for the large differences
between young and older adults during similar periods of bed rest remain to be elucidated, but higher cortisol levels and reduced response to anabolic stimuli in older
adults seem to play a role (English and Paddon-Jones 2010).
Critical life events are important time-frames for nutritional interventions. With
nutrition and exercise, losses in muscle mass and muscle quality can be minimised,
possibly preserving independence in daily activities. During and after a hospital stay
and other forms of bed rest, careful monitoring of a patient’s dietary intake, nutritional intake and physical activity is important. Lifestyle interventions within the
capabilities of the patient, and the possibilities of the setting, are recommended to be
administered when needed (English and Paddon-Jones, 2010). These interventions
should try to include resistance exercise (or, if impossible, aerobic exercise or exercise mimetics) (Kouw et al. 2019), combined with supplementation with anabolic
nutrients such as protein (English and Paddon-Jones 2010), leucine (English et al.
2015), or β-hydroxy β-methyl butyric acid (Deutz et al. 2013).
Often, these critical life events occur unannounced and are the result of acute
injuries or diseases. In the case of elective surgeries, such as planned joint replacements, preparation for the critical life event is possible. This idea led to the concept
of prehabilitation, or the *better in, better out concept* (Hoogeboom et al. 2014). In the
weeks leading to surgery, patients are prepared via exercise training programs, often
in combination with nutrition. Prehabilitation programs aim to increase muscle mass
and function, to create extra capacity to better deal with the inevitable losses during
hospital stays. The time window to train patients is short, on average around four

weeks (Moran et al. 2016; Hughes et al. 2019). A high-intensity aerobic interval and
resistance exercise training, in combination with protein supplementation, improves
muscle mass by 4% and muscle strength by 10%, just enough to prevent losses during
hospital stay (Grootswagers et al. 2020) (Fig. 14.3).
###### **14.4 Nutrition and Exercise**

Physicalfunctioningcanbedirectlyimprovedviaexercisetraining(Chouetal. 2012).
Therefore, exercise is the central aspect of the treatment of sarcopenia (Phu et al.
2015). The role of nutrition is often more indirect and supportive of exercise training,
but the potential of nutrition deserves not to be overlooked. Some nutrients have clear
anabolic properties and play important roles in muscle protein synthesis, muscle mass
maintenance, and muscle repair. Other nutrients are involved in mechanisms that
can improve the muscle output, such as force, power and endurance, by improving
nutrient availability in the muscle, by improving the quality of the muscle tissue
architecture or by improving the neurological activation mechanisms of the muscle.
The main anabolic nutrient is protein. The consumption of proteins elevates
concentrations of amino acids and insulin in the bloodstream. The increased concen
trations of these anabolic compounds are signaled by receptors located in the
sarcolemma and increase the activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
pathway, which is the central pathway in muscle protein synthesis stimulation
(McCarthy and Esser 2010) (Fig. 14.4). Leucine, an essential amino acid, has a
direct stimulating effect on mTOR (Son et al. 2019) and is proposed as a key amino
acid in muscle anabolism (Drummond and Rasmussen 2008). Interestingly, some of
the pathways via which protein leads to muscle anabolism are proposed to underly
an effect of protein on bone mass, too ( **Text box 1** ). Importantly, over the course
of ageing, the response to anabolic stimuli is blunted. This anabolic resistance can

**Fig. 14.4** Pathways via

be overcome by increasing the nutrient dosage and by increasing physical activity
(Burd et al. 2013).
Increasing muscle mass is not the only mode of action via which nutrition and
exercise can improve physical performance during ageing. Nutrients are involved
in many more pathways that determine muscle output, such as muscle architecture,
muscle energetics and neurological activation of the skeletal muscle tissue. The most
important determinants of muscle quality where nutrients can play a role are (1)
type-II atrophy, (2) mitochondrial dysfunction, (3) fat infiltration and (4) decreased
neurological activation. The way in which nutrition and exercise can improve each
of these four aspects of muscle quality will be explained below.
###### ***14.4.1 Type-II Atrophy***

Specific type II muscle fibre atrophy is an important determinant of age-related
decreases in muscle mass and quality. In muscle tissue, we distinguish two fibre
types: type I and type II (Schiaffino and Reggiani, 2011). Type I fibres have a higher
abundance of mitochondria and oxidative enzymes (Schiaffino 2010) and are more
abundant in the skeletal muscle tissue of endurance athletes (Wilson et al. 2012).
The type II fibres (including type IIa, IIb and IIx) have a higher glycolytic enzyme
activity than type I fibres have (Essén et al. 1975), but they are more prone to fatigue
(Talbot and Maves, 2016). Type II fibres are more abundant in the skeletal muscle
tissue of sprinters and weight lifters (Wilson et al. 2012). During ageing, specific
atrophy of type II muscle fibre size occurs. Research shows that the size of type II
muscle fibres is 10 to 40% smaller in older compared to young adults (Nilwik et al.
2013; Dreyer et al. 2006; Kosek et al. 2006; Verdijk et al. 2014). Interestingly, one
study showed that the difference in type II fibre size fully explained between-group
differences in quadriceps size (Nilwik et al. 2013).


-----

282 P. Grootswagers et al.

The cross-sectional area of type II muscle fibres does not only correlate with
muscle mass but also with leg strength (Verdijk et al. 2010). Targeting age-related
type II fibre atrophy is, therefore, a potential strategy to improve muscle quality.
Studies show promising results on improving type II fibre size via resistance exercise
(Charette et al. 1991; Campbell et al. 1999; Hagerman et al. 2000; McGuigan et al.
2001; Claflin et al. 2011; Kryger and Andersen 2007; Suetta et al. 2008; Karavirta
et al. 2011; Leenders et al. 2013; Frank et al. 2016; Holwerda et al. 2018; Pyka et al.
1994; Trappe et al. 2000). It should be noted that there is an equal amount of RCTs
that fail to show improvements in type II fibre size (Taaffe et al. 1996; Sipila et al.
1997; Godard et al. 2002; Campbell et al. 2002; Brose et al. 2003; Slivka et al. 2008;
Cooke et al. 2014; Snijders et al. 2019; Strandberg et al. 2019; Trappe et al. 2001;
Mero et al. 2013; Mitchell et al. 2015; Bechshoft et al. 2017), which could be due to
different training regimens or duration, sample characteristics, or low sample size.
Other types of exercise, such as endurance exercise and electrostimulation, do not
seem to improve type II fibre size.
Protein could theoretically augment resistance exercise-induced improvements
in type II fibre size by allowing muscle protein synthesis after resistance exercise
(Tipton et al. 1999). However, only one trial (Dirks et al. 2017) of a total of nine
showed positive effects of protein supplementation on type II fibre size in older
adults. Moreover, trials with leucine (Leenders et al. 2011), vitamin D (Vaes et al.
2018; Ceglia et al. 2013), antioxidants (Gouzi et al. 2019), creatine (Brose et al.
2003; Cooke et al. 2014) and chromium picolinate (Campbell et al. 1999, 2002)
failed to improve type II fibre size in older adults, suggesting that this determinant of
muscle quality should be targeted predominantly via resistance exercise. Resistance
exercise could be combined with supplementation of anabolic nutrients to obtain
postulated additional improvements in type II fibre size (Little and Phillips, 2009),
but this strategy needs further investigation in older adults.
###### ***14.4.2 Mitochondrial Dysfunction***

Apart from focussing on improving muscle strength via increasing the size of type II
fibres, another promising strategy to improve muscle quality is by improving mitochondrial functioning in skeletal muscle tissue. Due to the specific atrophy of type II
fibers, muscles of older adults have a higher proportion of type I fibres, which have
a greater abundance of mitochondria (Schiaffino 2010). Yet, the number of mitochondria and the mitochondrial oxidative capacity are reduced in older individuals
(Sun et al. 2016). Sarcopenic individuals show an even further reduced mitochondrial
oxidative capacity (Migliavacca et al. 2019). In these individuals, the biosynthesis
of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD [+] ) is also repressed (Migliavacca et al.
2019). Studies show that lower mitochondrial functioning relates to lower physical
performance in older adults (Santanasto et al. 2016; Coen et al. 2013).


-----

14 Nutrition and Exercise to Maintain Physical Functioning During Ageing 283

Nutrition might stimulate mitochondrial functioning via multiple targets
(Wesselink et al. 2019). For instance, dietary intake of NAD [+] -precursors, such as
vitamin B3 and tryptophan, can lead to increased levels of NAD [+] (Rajman et al.
2018; Liu et al. 2018). Moreover, certain bio-actives, such as ursolic acid, seem
to directly improve mitochondrial biogenesis in mice models (Chen et al. 2017a).
In older adults, the few trials that have tested the effects of different nutrients, or
bio-actives, on mitochondrial functioning all found positive results (Pollack et al.
2017; Taub et al. 2016; Alway et al. 2017; de Oliveira et al. 2017). Regarding muscle
quality, targeting the mitochondria might be the approach that is most adaptive to
subtle changes in the environments, such as obtained by nutritional interventions.
Apart from interventions with nutrients or bio-actives, endurance training and highintensity interval training seem effective in improving mitochondrial functioning

too.
###### ***14.4.3 Fat Infiltration***

The third determinant of muscle quality is the infiltration of fat tissue in the muscle.
The cross-sectional images of quadriceps muscle tissue presented in Fig. 14.5 show
a clear presence of intramuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) in the 66-year-old person
(B) compared to the 24-year-old person (A) (McLeod et al. 2016). While IMAT does
contribute to quadriceps volume and to apparent muscle mass, it negatively affects
muscle strength (Akazawa et al. 2017, Akazawa et al. 2018) or muscle endurance
(Akazawa et al. 2017). Fat infiltration is, therefore, an illustrative cause of a loss in
muscle quality, as it directly decreases the muscle strength per unit of muscle size. Fat

infiltration may be an essential risk factor for functional decline (Visser et al. 2005).
The first studies in older adults show that exercise programs can decrease IMAT
(Ikenaga et al. 2017) or prevent IMAT accumulation (Goodpaster et al. 2008). That
IMAT accumulation in the muscle is preventable by lifestyle is also visible in Fig. 5c.
This quadriceps belongs to a 66-year-old male with a high level of physical activity.
The quadriceps of this person shows amounts of IMAT that are more comparable to
those of the 24-year-old male (A) than to those of the 66-year-old sedentary male (B).
This suggests that physical activity might diminish the effects of ageing on IMAT
accumulation. Yet, exercise interventions in older adults have yielded conflicting
results.

Apart from physical activity, nutrition might play a role in IMAT accumulation
too. Increased IMAT is observed in older adults at risk of malnutrition (Akazawa
et al. 2019), with diabetes (Schafer et al. 2010), and it is related to increased insulin
resistance (Albu et al. 2005; Goodpaster et al. 2000). These findings highlight the
metabolic aspects of IMAT and suggest a role for nutritional interventions to prevent
or decrease IMAT build up. The first dietary interventions aimed at lowering IMAT
in older adults have been finished recently, with positive results for supplementing
whey protein and vitamin D (Yamada et al. 2019; Englund et al. 2019).
###### ***14.4.4 Neurological Activation***

In some cases, the loss in strength output of a muscle is not caused by morphological
changes within the muscle tissue but by decreased neuromuscular activation and the
loss of motor units (Clark and Fielding, 2012). Typically during ageing, we observe
a loss in voluntary activation (Rozand et al. 2020). That is, the maximum force
output generated by a patient’s nervous system is lower than the maximum output
that can be generated with electrostimulation of the muscle. Decreased voluntary
activation is related to decreased physical functioning in older adults (Clark et al.
2011, 2010; Reid et al. 2014). Vitamin D (Dhesi et al. 2004) and homocysteinelowering nutrients vitamin B6, B12 and folate (Longstreth et al. 1996a, Soumaré
et al. 2006) are postulated to improve neuromuscular activation. However, the direct
effect of these nutrients on neuromuscular outcomes are rarely measured (Kougias
et al. 2018). Nutrients tested in randomised controlled trials that do show to improve
neuromuscular activation in older adults are creatine (Stout et al. 2007), milk fat
globule membrane (Minegishi et al. 2016) and N-3 fatty acids (Rodacki et al. 2012).
The exercise regimens that are most effective in improving neuromuscular activation
are resistance training and power training.

###### **14.5 Future**

The future of nutrition and exercise for the maintenance of physical functioning
during ageing is exciting. Many nutrients have been identified as possible factors
in physical functioning. In this final section of the chapter, an overview of the most
promising nutrients is given, as well as special attention to the foreseen consequences
of a transition to more plant based protein sources. ***14.5.1 Vitamin B6, B12 and Folate***

The three vitamins B6, B12 and folate act together in the one-carbon pathway,
via which they suppress concentrations of homocysteine. Lowering homocysteine
concentrations could be a successful strategy to improve physical functioning.
Suppressed homocysteine relates to better performance in different domains of physical functioning (Vidoni et al. 2017; Kuo et al. 2007; van Schoor et al. 2012). Elevated
homocysteine concentrations could hamper the functioning of mitochondria (Chen
et al. 2017b, Ganapathy et al. 2011; Veeranki and Tyagi, 2013) and endothelia
(Loscalzo 1996) and are related to increased white matter intensities, which affect
the functioning of lower extremities (Longstreth et al. 1996b, Soumare et al. 2006).
Therefore, these three B-vitamins could play a role in preserving functional capacities during ageing. Indeed, in the last years, a couple of studies have identified a
possible role for B-vitamins in the maintenance of physical functioning during ageing
(Behrouzi et al. 2019; Grootswagers et al. 2021; Balboa-Castillo et al. 2018; Struijk
et al. 2018). ***14.5.2 Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Vitamin D***

Fatty fish species, such as salmon, herring and mackerel, are rich in omega-3 fatty
acids and vitamin D, and intake of these types of fish are related to improved physical
functioning in older adults (Struijk et al. 2018, Rondanelli et al. 2020). Omega-3
fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties and could thereby target inflammageing
(Dupontetal. 2019),oneofthehallmarksofageing.Additionally,omega-3fattyacids
can attenuate anabolic resistance by improving insulin sensitivity and endothelial
functioning (Dupont et al. 2019, Smith et al. 2011). When combined with anabolic
nutrients such as protein and amino acids, omega-3 fatty acids can improve muscle
mass and functioning in older adults (Di Girolamo et al. 2014).
Vitamin D could influence muscle functioning by regulating protein synthesis and
mitochondrial functioning (Domingues-Faria et al. 2017). Vitamin D status is related
to improved physical functioning in older adults (Bischoff-Ferrari et al. 2004) and
seems to be protective against falls (Bischoff-Ferrari et al. 2009). Where we already


-----

saw interactions between vitamin B6, B12 and folate, and between omega-3 fatty
acids and protein intake, vitamin D has an interaction with calcium (Lips 2012).
These interactions indicate the importance of food matrices: the natural form of
foods in which nutrients present themselves together, such as protein, omega-3 fatty
acids and vitamin D in fish, or vitamin D and calcium in dairy products. On a higher
level, there seems to be an interaction between food items, clustered as food patterns,
such as the Mediterranean diet, which is related to improved functionality at higher
ages (Shahar et al. 2012; Critselis and Panagiotakos 2020; Milaneschi et al. 2011).
###### ***14.5.3 Hormetins***

Hormetins are a special group of nutrients, as these components of food often do not
have clear biological functions but do seem to play important roles in preventing agerelated declines in functioning (Rattan 2008). These compounds cause mild stress in
cells. Mild stress is postulated to yield beneficial effects via supercompensation, a
phenomenon most known from exercise physiology. Exercise is a stressor for many
body systems, but the recovery and supercompensation of the stress improve the
functionality of these systems. The overall mechanism is called *hormesis* and works
in a similar fashion, where mild stressors to the body, cells, or systems improve
the functionality (Gems and Partridge 2008, Rattan 2008). Nutritional hormetins
include flavonoids, resveratrol, antioxidants, and ursolic acid. Ursolic acid has shown
potential in inhibiting muscle atrophy (Kunkel et al. 2011, 2012) and stimulating
mitochondrial functioning (Chen et al. 2017a, Grootswagers et al. 2018). Resveratrol
was found to improve mitochondrial functioning (Alway et al. 2017; Pollack et al.
2017) and type-II fiber size (Alway et al. 2017). Flavonoids are part of polyphenols
and are found in dark chocolate, tea, coffee, fruits and vegetables, and have been
related to improved mitochondrial functioning (Taub et al. 2016) and muscle mass
maintenance (Salucci and Falcieri, 2020). There are many more compounds in natural
foods that classify as hormetins, and the research outlook into these compounds in
relation to ageing is exciting. ***14.5.4 Protein Transition***

Societal and governmental pressures lead to more and more people transiting from
animal-based protein sources to plant-based protein sources. Animal protein has
always been considered superior to plant protein in muscle anabolism (Gorissen
and Witard, 2018). The quality of these animal proteins, which is based on amino
acid composition and bio-availability, is overall higher than that of plant protein. It is
therefore not surprising that studies have found greater acute muscle protein synthesis
responses to animal products in comparison to soy, wheat or rice protein (Gorissen
et al. 2016, Hartman et al. 2007, Phillips 2012, Tang et al. 2009, Wilkinson et al.


-----

14 Nutrition and Exercise to Maintain Physical Functioning During Ageing 287

2007, Yang et al. 2012). Also, in longitudinal studies, indications for a muscle mass,
preserving superiority of animal protein have been found (McLean et al. 2016).
On the other hand, there have been some studies that found results suggesting
an advantageous role for plant protein in the preservation of physical functioning
(Dawson-Hughes et al. 2010; Behrouzi et al. 2019), possibly via alkaline properties (Dawson-Hughes et al. 2008). However, it is possible that in these studies, that
were cross-sectional in nature, a confounding effect of dietary quality was present.
After all, diets containing many plant proteins also contain many vitamins, minerals,
fibers, hormetins and other bioactive compounds found in plants. There is a clear
need for controlled, long-term, diet-based studies scrutinising the true consequences
of shifting towards plant-based diets in older adults. These diet-based studies should
follow a more holistic approach to balance the reductionistic dominance in current
evidence – in other words, investigating meals or diets instead of single foods or
ingredients (Burd et al. 2019).
###### ***14.5.5 Implementation of Effective Interventions***

Over the years, many effective lifestyle treatments against malnutrition, sarcopenia
and frailty have been identified. Unfortunately, many of these interventions do not
find their way to practice (van Dongen 2019). Only by proper implementation of
successful interventions in clinical practice, older adults can benefit from the wealth
of knowledge that is being acquired by science. Proper implementation is thus very
important but also a time-consuming activity. As an example, we showcase the implementation process of an intervention called ProMuscle. ProMuscle started as a clinical trial in 2010 and proved the efficacy of resistance training in combination with
protein supplementation on lean body mass and physical performance in frail older
adults (Tieland et al. 2012b, Tieland et al. 2012c). The clinical trial was translated
to practice and piloted in 2014 (van Dongen et al. 2017) and after adaptations tested
for effectiveness in a large practical study between 2016 and 2018 (van Dongen
et al. 2020), where it proved to be effective. These positive effects in practice led to
the awarding of an official entry in the Dutch Centre of Healthy Living database of
governmental approved effective interventions. In future steps, the ProMuscle intervention will be further implemented into regional and national care patterns. With
a path of 10 years between clinical study and the official recognition, this example
clearly shows that a great effort is needed to successfully implement effective lifestyle
treatments in practice. However, the societal impact and the benefits for older adults
of proper implementation do evidently outweigh this effort.

###### **14.6 Conclusion**

To conclude, declining physical functioning during ageing is a serious problem.
Lifestyle interventions have great potential in preventing and treating losses in muscle
mass, muscle quality and physical functioning. These interventions should be welltimed and should employ the nutrition-exercise synergism as well as the combined
effects of different nutrients in holistic approaches.

**Textboxes:**

**1: Bone**

**Textbox 1**

Asidefromthedecliningmusclemassandmusclequalityduringageing,decreases
in bone health play important roles in age-related declines in physical abilities. Bone
mass declines gradually after the age of 30, and in women, steeply after menopause.
Reduced bone mass severely increases the risk of fractures and can result in osteoporosis, a geriatric phenotype prevalent in 9–38% of women and 1–8% of men (Wade
et al. 2014). Nutrition plays an important role in bone mass retention during ageing.
Notoriously, vitamin D and calcium are related to improved bone health, but supplementation studies are inconclusive (Zhao et al. 2017). Protein intake might play a
more important role by stimulation IGF-1 and by increasing dietary calcium uptake
(Dolan and Sale 2019), and higher protein intake is indeed related to reduced fracture
risk (Groenendijk et al. 2019). Interestingly, vitamin D, calcium and protein are typically present in animal-based foods. A purely plant-based diet might thus jeopardise
bone health, a notion that indeed has been observed in longitudinal observational
studies, where vegans showed to have 15 times higher fracture risk compared to
omnivores (Tong et al. 2020).

#### **Dietary Patterns and Healthy Ageing**

**Federica Tagliaferri, and Mario Barbagallo**

**Abstract** Ageing is a complex process in which multiple factors are involved that
can contribute to determine whether a person will or not be affected by diseases
that are more frequently observed in advanced age. The factors involved comprise
genetic, environmental, behavioural, and dietary factors, which influence pathways
that regulate the ageing process and the life expectancy, rendering longevity a multifaceted phenomenon. Even if a miraculous elixir or pill is not yet available, there
is general agreement that nutrition has a major impact on the overall mortality and
on the development of age-related chronic non-communicable diseases. Nutrition
research has focused for decades on single nutrients in relation to health outcomes,
although people eat food and combinations of foods rather than nutrients in isolation. Even if research on specific nutrients is scientifically valid and may provide key
information on the mechanisms of effects, recent attention to the complex synergistic
interactions among nutrients, other food constituents, and whole foods, has led to a
growing interest in the total dietary patterns. This chapter describes some specific
dietary patterns that have been associated with an increased life expectancy and
with reductions of incident chronic diseases, thus consenting people to live a longer
and healthier life. We describe the main characteristics and available evidence for

Mediterranean, vegetarian, Japanese, and Okinawa dietary patterns, confirming the
powerful role that nutrition plays in healthy ageing.

development as well as in medicine, in particular resulting in marked reduction of
fatal childhood illness, maternal mortality, as well as mortality at older ages (Beard
et al. 2016). Life expectancy had not changed from ancient times in Europe at the
time of the Roman Empire up to the end of the nineteenth century (Harman 2001).
Contrariwise, currently most European citizens and persons living in Japan may
expect to live over eighty years and worldwide now most people can expect to live
beyond sixty years (Beard et al. 2016). Furthermore, a person aged sixty year today
could expect to live, on average, additional twenty-two years. Worldwide, from 1990
to 2013, life expectancy at birth rose by 6.2 years (95% UI 5.6–6.6), from 65.3 years
in 1990 to 71.5 years in 2013 (Murray et al. 2015).
The reduction in infectious diseases with the advances in diagnosis strategies,
antibiotics, vaccines, and hygienic conditions among others, has been accompanied
by a rise in the development of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) more frequently
observed in old age, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases and responsible for about 70% of global deaths annually, including
premature deaths (between the ages of 30 and 70 years) (Murray et al. 2015). This
apparent dilemma of lengthening the average life duration and increasing degenerative illness is foreseeable, because a long-lived organism is exposed for a longer
time to risk factors that provoke such diseases. This occurs not only in industrialized
nations but also in developing and underdeveloped areas where the populations are
more numerous (Dominguez et al. 2006; Eyowas et al. 2019).
Thus, mortality attributable to NCDs has incessantly increased and continues
to grow throughout the world. Not only deaths but also morbidity, disability and
deterioration of the quality of life are growing linked to the development of these
frequent diseases (Murray et al. 2015). Because NCDs are more frequently seen
in old age, persistent ageing of the world population is one of the prime factors to
explain the explosion of NCDs. The consequences for health, health systems, their
workforce, and budgets are profound (Beard et al. 2016). Thus, the goals of medicine
might not only focus at the extension of life but also at ensuring an old age as free
as possible of morbidity and disability.
A fundamental determinant of this alarming scenario has been recognized in the
modifications in lifestyle of entire populations, which entail a large incidence of risk
factors. Unhealthy diet, overeating, sedentary lifestyle, and cigarette smoking will
be the true architects of the increased incidence of obesity, hypertension, diabetes,
and dyslipidaemia, all strong risk factors for CVD and some types of cancer.
In 2019, 7.9 million deaths and 187.7 million disability-adjusted life years
(DALYs) were attributable to dietary risk factors. High intake of sodium and low
intake of whole grains and fruits were leading dietary risks for deaths and DALYs
worldwide. NCDs dietary risk factors increased significantly during 1990–2019
(Qiao et al. 2021). Therefore, greater efforts are needed to raise public awareness of
interventions and improve dietary practices to reduce the disease burden caused by
suboptimal dietary intake.
For decades nutrition research was focused on single nutrients in relation to health
outcomes. Albeit people eat food and not isolated nutrients, the practice of referring to nutrition as a composite of nutrients and other biochemicals rather than as

15 Dietary Patterns and Healthy Ageing 303

food is still widespread among scientists, food industry, governmental guidelines,
and the lay public. That approach used to limit dietary guidance to recommendations on some nutrients, which had inadvertent significant implications for science,
industry, and the public. Even if research on specific nutrients is scientifically valid
and may provide key information on the mechanisms of effects, consumers and
the food industry may misinterpret information that may not be correct or relevant.
Conversely, recent attention to the complex synergistic interactions among nutrients, other food constituents, and whole foods, has led to a growing interest in total
dietary patterns (Jacobs and Orlich 2014). Several a priori and a posteriori methods
have been developed to appraise the adherence to a dietary pattern instead of only
taking into account single nutrients or foods, including the summation of food or
nutrient recommendations met; data-driven approaches (i.e., principal components
and cluster analyses) which describe actual intake patterns in the population; and
reduced rank regression, which defines linear combinations of food intakes that
maximally explain intermediate markers of disease. Overall, the focus on dietary
patterns has been rewarding in demonstrating the powerful protective associations of
healthy or prudent dietary patterns, and the higher health risk associations of Western
or meat and refined grains patterns. Although, there is no single optimal method for
describing a dietary pattern, due mainly to the complexity of the multiple combinations and interactions, this approach has been very useful and appreciated helping to
decipher which dietary patterns are likely to be associated with healthy ageing, such
as those included in this chapter. Thus, the research on dietary pattern has a great
potential for nutrition policy, especially demonstrating the key role of total diet in
health promotion. While the advances in understanding what foods combinations are
best for health is certainly a step forward in nutrition research, other major challenges
persist, such as how to make available high-quality food to multitudes, that is at the
same time sustainable (Willett et al. 2019).
This chapter describes some specific dietary patterns which have been shown,
by experimental, epidemiological and clinical evidences, to be associated with
an increased life expectancy, and reductions of incident NCDs, thus consenting
people to live a longer and healthier life. We describe the main characteristics and
evidence of Mediterranean, vegetarian, Japanese, and Okinawa dietary patterns. In
fact, geographical areas where the world’s longest-lived persons have been identified, the so called “Blue Zones” (Poulain et al. 2004), follow healthy diets with the
principles of Mediterranean, Japanese, or vegetarian dietary patterns, confirming the
powerful role that nutrition plays in healthy ageing.
###### **15.2 Mediterranean Dietary Pattern**

A large body of research, initiated with the Seven Countries Studies (Keys 1995) and
continued uninterrupted, has consistently shown that the traditional dietary habits
and lifestyle followed by population living in the Mediterranean basin (Mediterranean diet, MeDiet), may play a key role in the prevention of NCDs and premature

mortality (Trichopoulou et al. 2014; Carlos and Fuente-Arrillaga et al. 2018; Dinu
et al. 2018; Martinez-Gonzalez et al. 2019). MeDiet has been included in the 2015–
2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans among the most healthy dietary pattern
recommended (Tagtow et al. 2016) and has been associated with greater nutrient
adequacy addressing deficit of fibre, calcium, magnesium, potassium, all nutrients
identified as of public health concern (Serra-Majem et al. 2003). This dietary pattern,
mostly based on plant-derived foods (but also admitting low amounts of animal food),
favouring seasonal and local food consumption and production, emerges as an eating
model that also takes into consideration environmental concerns. The traditional

MeDiet is not merely a cluster of foods, but also a cultural model that comprises
the way food is selected, processed, and distributed, together with other foundations
of lifestyle. These characteristics have led UNESCO in 2010 to include MeDiet on
the list of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity (Dernini and Berry 2015). It
comprises an abundant daily consumption of seasonal and colourful vegetables with
none or minimal culinary interventions, fresh fruit of the season consumed at the
end of every meal, nuts and seeds (as snacks and as part of recipes), legumes several
times per week, unprocessed cereals every day, high consumption of olive oil as the
main source of fat (for cooking and added raw for seasoning), herbs and spices to
season recipes, moderate amount of fish (2–3 times per week), dairy products (milk,
yogurt, cheese) allowed daily in limited quantities, eggs (3–4 per week), sweets only
a few times a week, red meat and meat products with extreme moderation (1–2 times
per month), drinking plenty of water, as opposed to wine, which is consumed in
moderation with meals always respecting beliefs of each community (Trichopoulou
et al. 2014). MeDiet is composed mainly of unprocessed nutrient-dense foods, in
contrast to “empty calories” of westernized diets rich in processed foods that are
full of calories but poor in nutrients, undeniably associated with an increased risk
of NCDs and obesity. In addition to the nutritional components, MeDiet comprises
historical knowledge, practices, skills, and traditions, transmitted from generation
to generation, as well as physical activity and consuming meals in the company of
others.

Regrettably, a large portion of the current populations from Mediterranean countries, where the benefits of MeDiet were first described, are moving away from
this dietary pattern, mainly for portion sizes, proportions of food groups, and used of
industrial food (Kyriacou et al. 2015). This is particularly true for children and adolescents (Archero et al. 2018), possibly due to the ubiquitous diffusion of Westernization and globalization of food production and consumption, which has homogenized
eating behaviour worldwide in present times.
Extensive medical literature has shown that a higher adherence to the MeDiet was
associated with reduction of total mortality (Bonaccio and Castelnuovo et al. 2018;
Eleftheriou et al. 2018); reduced incidence of CVD and related mortality (MartinezGonzalez et al. 2019); lower rates of cognitive decline, dementia, and depression
(Lai et al. 2014; Singh et al. 2014; Dominguez et al. 2019); reduced cancer-related
mortality and incidence of breast, colorectal, head and neck, respiratory, gastric,
bladder, and liver cancer (Morze et al. 2021); weight loss and reduction in BMI
(Esposito et al. 2011); reduced incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) (Schwingshackl

et al. 2015); reduced risk of chronic obstructive respiratory disease (Fischer et al.
2019); as well as reduced incident fragility fractures (Benetou et al. 2013; Byberg
et al. 2016; Haring et al. 2016).
Besides its multiple health beneficial effects, MeDiet emphasizes the respect of
seasonal crop cycles, territory and biodiversity, warranting a correct balance between
nature, mankind and renewal of resources (Dernini and Berry 2015). For all these
reasons, the MeDiet is a healthy and sustainable dietary model, proving to be one of
the most sustainable nutritional patterns for both, the environment and our health.
###### **15.3 Vegetarian Dietary Patterns**

In general, vegetarian diets are adopted following ethical, health, environmental,
religious,political,cultural,aesthetic,economic,andculinaryinfluences.Theydonot
follow specific ethnic or geographical locations, although some countries have more
persons following this type of diet, but identify eating practices that totally or partially
excludefoodsofanimalorigin.Vegetariandietsarecharacterizedbyahighandvaried
consumptionofplant-basedfoodsincludingfruits,vegetables,cerealgrains,nuts,and
seeds, mushrooms, vegetable oil, herbs, and spices. There are several variations of the
vegetarian dietary pattern, including vegan (excludes all animal products including
honey), vegan raw (as vegan with food cooked at temperature below 48 °C), lactovegetarian (includes dairy products but not eggs), ovo-vegetarian (includes eggs but
not dairy products), and lacto-ovo vegetarian (includes dairy products and eggs),
pesco-vegetarian (includes fish and seafood) but all avoid red meat consumption and
may abstain from by-products of animal slaughter (i.e. rennet and gelatine) (Melina
et al. 2016). The avoidance of foods with animal origin at a population level may
have positive environmental consequences. It is now accepted that a plant-based diet
produces significant less greenhouse gas emissions compared to animal-based diets,
thus reducing the environmental damage (McMichael et al. 2007; Rosi et al. 2017;
Willett et al. 2019).
One of the “Blue Zones” described by Poulain et al. is in Loma Linda in California,
where a group of near 9,000 people from the Seventh Day Adventist community seem
to live longer than other Californians showing a lower incidence of cancer and CVD
(Poulain et al. 2004). Results from the large Adventist Health Study 2 (AHS-2)
showed that participants with higher adherence to a vegetarian dietary pattern had a
significant lower hazard ratio for all-cause mortality when considering all kinds of
vegetarians after a follow-up of 5.79 years. However, considering different types of
vegetarianism, that is, vegans, lacto-ovo-vegetarians, and semi-vegetarians compared
to non-vegetarians, only pesco-vegetarians had lower mortality, while the rest of the
groups had no benefit. The significant associations were larger and more often significant for men than for women (Orlich et al. 2013). There has been some concern
about the increased risk of vitamin B12 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
(PUFA) deficit among vegetarians (Li 2014). Recent analyses including prospective studies other than the Adventist Health Study, have demonstrated significant


-----

although smaller risk reductions for CVD mortality, cerebrovascular disease, T2D,
and chronic kidney disease. In addition, there are yet concerns about different dietary
deficiencies with strict vegan diets for protein, omega-3 PUFA, vitamin D, vitamin
B12, iron, calcium, and zinc (Rocha et al. 2019). A systematic review including 86
cross-sectional and 10 cohort prospective studies found that among cross-sectional
studies there was an overall reduction in BMI, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol,
and blood glucose concentrations in vegetarians and vegans compared to omnivores.
In prospective studies, the analyses found a significant reduced risk of incidence

−
and/or mortality from ischemic heart disease (IHD) ( 25%) and of incidence of total

−
cancer ( 8%), but not of total CV and cerebrovascular diseases, all-cause mortality
and cancer-related mortality. Considering only vegans, there was a decreased risk

−
of incident total cancer ( 15%), but the number of studies was limited (Dinu et al.
2017). A meta-analysis of eight studies among 183,321 participants, found a significant heterogeneity, particularly evident for studies of Seventh Day Adventists (SDA)
cohorts. In fact, SDA studies reported greater effect size as compared to non-SDA
studies that were significant only for reduction of IHD. The authors concluded that
there is modest CV benefit, but no clear reduction in overall mortality associated with
a vegetarian diet. The benefit was driven mainly by studies in SDA, whereas the effect
of vegetarian diet in other cohorts remains unproven (Kwok et al. 2014). Noteworthy,
Adventists also follow lifestyle components, such as exercise and avoiding smoking
that can contribute to protection against NCDs. A recent analysis comparing AHS2 participants and non-smokers control US populations found a significant lower
all-cause and cancer-related mortality, as well as breast, colorectal, and lung cancer
incidents in AHS-2 participants vs. controls (Fraser et al. 2020). Other analyses from
the AHS-2 including 125,000 participants showed that vegetarianism has a potential
protection against obesity, T2D, and metabolic syndrome risk (Tonstad et al. 2009;
Rizzo et al. 2011). However, it is not yet completly clear whether the reduction in
T2D risk in vegetarians can be attributed to the absence of meat or to the higher intake
of plant foods. As regards dementia, an earlier analysis of two cohorts from the AHS
compared participants consuming vegetarian diets vs. those consuming meat. In a
small cohort meat-eaters were twice more likely to become demented as their vegetarian controls. A second analysis in a larger cohort showed no significant differences
between vegetarians and non-vegetarians. An important limitation was the lack of
clear indication of any standardized cognitive assessment during the studies (Giem
et al. 1993). A more recent study aimed to evaluate the influence of lifestyle risk
factors and religious living on chronic neurological diseases, because SDA do not
consume tobacco, alcohol, or pork, and many adhere to lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet, and
Baptists discourage excessive use of alcohol and tobacco. Comparing the hospital
admission rates for some major neurological diseases among 6,532 SDA and 3,720
Baptists, the incidence for dementia or Alzheimer’s disease was significantly lower
for members of both communities, while the incidence for Parkinson’s disease and
epilepsy were not significantly different vs. the general population (Thygesen et al.
2017). More studies are still needed to understand the interaction between such
lifestyle and other components of the religious belief systems.

15 Dietary Patterns and Healthy Ageing 307

As the consumption of meat, especially red and processed meat, has been associated with an increase in mortality and other negative health outcomes (Wang et al.
2016), it is difficult to define whether the benefit of vegetarian diets derives from
the greater consumption of plant-food, lack of consumption of meat, or substitution
by other foods. Nevertheless, the health benefits of adhering to vegetarian dietary
patternscontinuetobereported.Mountingevidencefavoursawholefoodplant-based
diet that minimizes processed foods and emerges as a potential universal healthy diet.
A consensus agreement on the specific definitions of vegetarian diets is currently
lacking, which can help explain the heterogeneity of some results. It is also imperative to indicate the integration of vitamin B12, vitamin D and other nutrients if a
deficiency is suspected.
###### **15.4 Japanese Dietary Pattern**

Japan is the country with the highest life expectancy, the most accelerated ageing,
and the largest number of centenarians in the world (Ikeda et al. 2011). In 2002,
Japanese female life expectancy rose at a consistent rate of about 3 months per year
for the preceding 160 years (Oeppen and Vaupel 2002).The Seven Countries Studies
already had shown that, together with the MeDiet, the Japanese dietary pattern was
associated with low rates of IHD and all-cause mortality compared to the US and
Finish diets (Keys et al. 1984; Willett 1994). More recent cohort observational studies
have confirmed these findings, demonstrating that adherence to a Japanese diet results
in a lower risk of cardiovascular mortality (Shimazu et al. 2007; Okada et al. 2018). A
study by Okada et al. developed a Japanese diet score derived from seven food groups
(beans and bean products, fresh fishes, vegetables, Japanese pickles, fungi, seaweeds,
and fruits). There was a significant association between a higher adherence to the
Japanese diet score and lower all-cause and CVD mortality, especially in women
(Okada et al. 2018). Possibly the association of adherence to the traditional Japanese
diet and low rates of incident IHD may be due to the high consumption of omega-3
PUFA (Okuyama et al. 1996). Yet, the risk of stroke and cerebrovascular disease is
quite high in Japanese metropolitan areas, where excessive salt consumption, stress,
smoking, and alcohol abuse may account for the higher prevalence of hypertension
(Shimazu et al. 2007; Iso 2011).
Due to the exceptional longevity of Japan, interest has increased in the scientific
community attempting to clarify what this Japanese super-longevity is due to. The
Japanese dietary pattern mainly comprises small portions of fresh seasonal traditional foods (fish, rice, seaweeds, soy and derivatives, vegetables and green tea),
practicing the traditional habit of “hara hachi bu”, which means eating until you
are 80% full (Pignolo 2019, Galioto et al. 2008). Carbohydrates are largely represented, making up to 60 to 65% of total calories, owing to the high consumption of
rice; fat intake represents 20 to 25% of total energy, while proteins, especially of
plant origin, provides the remaining 5 to 10%. Compared to Mediterranean people,
Japanese consume lower amount of fats and the omega-6/omega-3 ratio is about 2

to 3 (Tokudome et al. 2004). An important disadvantage of diets in Japan and in
general in eastern Asia is their high sodium content. It is accepted that a dietary with
an excess of salt is associated with higher risk for the development of hypertension,
but also possibly for the increased risk of stomach cancer (Rust and Ekmekcioglu
2017).
Besides the healthy components of the Japanese diet, there are other lifestyle
features and social conditions that go together with it that help explain Japan’s exceptional longevity. The Japanese population achieved longevity in a fairly short time
through a rapid reduction in mortality rates for NCDs from the 1950s to the 1960s,
followed by a large reduction in stroke mortality rates, which was a high cause of
mortality in the 1950s. Health improvements in the Japanese population continued
after the mid-1960s through the execution of preventive community public health
measures against NCDs mortality, both primary and secondary, as well as the use
of advanced medical technologies by means of a total coverage insurance system.
This included inequalities reduction by similar educational opportunities and financial access at a population level. Currently, the accelerated ageing holds new major
challenges to sustain the improvement in ageing population health (Ikeda et al. 2011).
The archipelago of Japan composed of over 3,000 islands encompasses historical,
cultural, and religious influences and contacts with many other nations; all these
attributes have contributed to the genesis of the Japanese unique and peculiar dietary
style, conformed of an extensive variety of foods and characteristic gastronomy. In
1980 The Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries proposed the
concept of “Japanese Diet” for the first time, recognizing the general superiority in
terms of health compared to Western diets, a concept that, as mentioned, had already
been raised by the Seven Countries Study (Keys et al. 1984).
Afterwards, in 2005, the Japanese government started a series of programs on
dietary recommendations proposing to represent the traditional Japanese healthy diet
in a sort of inverted food pyramid, reminiscent of a spinning top. Running people
on the summit of the spinning top emphasized the importance of regular physical
activity and drinking water. This inverted cone was divided in four layers: the highest
comprised grain-based dishes (i.e., rice, noodles); the following down layer made of
plant-based dishes (i.e., raw and cooked vegetable and soups); the third made of fish,
eggs, meat and soy-bean dishes; and the fourth comprised dairy products and fruit
(Yoshiike et al. 2007).
A study examined the association between adherence to the Japanese Food Guide
Spinning Top and total and cause specific mortality; 36,624 participants aged 45
to 75 years, healthy at baseline were recruited from 11 public health centres across
Japan.Higherscoresonthefoodguide(betteradherence)wereassociatedwithsignificant lower total mortality. The score was also inversely associated with CVD-related
mortality and with cerebrovascular disease. There was some evidence, though not
significant, of an inverse association for cancer mortality (Kurotani et al. 2016).
Supporting these results, the onset of obesity-related tumours was lower in the
Japanese population, compared with the US population (Tokudome et al. 2000).
Regrettably, Japanese modern lifestyle has become markedly westernized. Using
a 12-item self-administered Japanese diet score (JDS), Kanauchi et al. evaluated a


-----

15 Dietary Patterns and Healthy Ageing 309

sample of 1458 Japanese citizens aged 18 to 84 years. They found that as much as
47.7% had a low adherence to JDS and only 11.1% showed high adherence. After
multivariate adjustments, younger and physically inactive persons, as well as heavy
drinkers were those most significantly associated with low adherence to JDS. They
proposed a Japanese diet pyramid similar to the MeDiet pyramid to be used as a
tool for nutrition education and dietary guidance (Kanauchi and Kanauchi 2019). In
the past, there was a greater prevalence of stomach cancer in Japan (excluding the
Okinawa prefecture) compared to North American and European countries, which
has been linked to the high consumption of salt and salt preserved foods (Hirohata
and Kono 1997). In recent years, this issue has progressively improved linked to
the recommendations for healthy eating and control of excess consumption of salt
(Inoue and Tsugane 2005). Another study aimed to evaluate the association between
the Japanese dietary pattern and disability-free survival (DFS) time in a sample
of 9456 Japanese older adults, followed for a 10-year period. Using a previously
validated Japanese Diet Index (JDI) to assess adherence, the authors reported that a
higher JDI score was significantly associated with longer DFS time compared to the
lowest JDI. Each 1-SD increase of the JDI score was associated with 3.7 additional

months of life without disability regardless of sex and chronic conditions at baseline
(Zhang et al. 2019). Regarding cognitive decline, a clinical trial, involving 1006
community-dwelling Japanese participants, aged 60 to 79 years followed up for a
median of 15 years, found that a high intake of soybeans and derivatives, vegetables,
seaweeds, fish and fruit and a low intake of rice was associated with a reduced risk
of developing Alzheimer’s disease (Ozawa et al. 2013).
###### **15.5 Okinawan Dietary Pattern**

This dietary pattern is followed by populations with the longest life expectancies
in the world, most of them maintaining active lives. In fact, Okinawa is part of the
five “Blue Zones”, being home to some of the world’s longest-lived people with
the lowest risk of aging-associated diseases (Poulain et al. 2004). The Okinawa diet
is a nutrient-dense, low-calorie diet original from the Japanese Ryukyu Islands, of
which Okinawa is the largest. The Okinawa diet has drawn particular attention in
recent years because native people from the island were found to have exceptional
longevity in relatively good health and the highest concentration of centenarians in
the world (Miyagi et al. 2003). Therefore, they have been intensively investigated in
an attempt to explain their long lifespan and in particular their lengthy health span.
Nevertheless, their life expectancy has fallen in recent years, possibly owing to a
decreasing use of the traditional local diet, as well as other genetic, lifestyle, and
environmental factors. Most of the calories (80%) of the Okinawan diet come from
vegetable sources, specifically, whole grains, fruits, legumes (mainly soy), relatively
small amounts of fish, and limited amounts of lean meats (Willcox et al. 2009).


-----

310 L. J. Dominguez et al.

Compared to the average Japanese diet, the traditional Okinawa diet has twenty
percent lower amount of calories and contained a large proportion of coloured vegetables (particularly sweet potatoes – *Ipomoea batatas* ). Sweet potato, the main carbohydrate source of Okinawa diet, is rich in antioxidants and has a low-glycaemic index,
while the Japanese diet takes carbohydrates from rice. Okinawa diet has low amounts
of saturated fats linked to a limited consumption of meat, eggs, and dairy products.
This dietary pattern may be considered a natural example of caloric restriction with
optimal nutrition, which has been proposed as a potential modifier of longevity
(Testa et al. 2014; Willcox and Willcox 2014). Centenarians from Okinawa follow
the Confucian teaching of “hara hachi bu” (Pignolo 2019, Galioto et al. 2008), which
is indeed a sort of caloric restriction. Among Okinawans, the onset of colon, prostate
and breast cancers is near 50% lower than in the rest of Japan (Willcox, Willcox
et al. 2009); this effect could be largely due to the limited intake of saturated fats,
the very low omega-6/omega-3 ratio, and the large amounts of antioxidant and antiinflammatory compounds consumed with the diet (Okuyama et al. 1996; Willcox
et al. 2009).
Although the risk of stroke and cerebrovascular disease is high among residents of
Japanese metropolitan areas with lower adherence to the traditional diet and lifestyle
(Shimazu et al. 2007; Iso 2011), the traditional Okinawa diet, further reduces the risk
of IHD and protects from the onset of strokes and cerebrovascular disease (Galioto
et al. 2008; Willcox et al. 2009; Willcox and Willcox 2014). The prevalence of obesity
in Japan is only 3 to 4%, which is much lower than the prevalence in European
countries and in the US, where obesity is a major determinant of the high prevalence
of NCDs. Prevalence of obesity and T2D are also very low in centenarians from
Okinawa (Willcox and Willcox 2014).
###### **15.6 Conclusions**

The field of nutrition has rapidly changed over the past century. Currently, it is
shifting the focus from managing diseases of overt nutrient deficits to a new paradigm
of diseases related to lifestyle factors, mainly excess caloric intake, sedentary lives
and anxiety. Advances in the nutrition field, technology and food industry have
contributed to decreasing the frequency of diseases of deficit in most regions, while
simultaneously witnessing the growing challenges of rising rates of obesity, NCDs,
and ageing. The initial reductionist approach, driven by the ambition to understand
the mechanisms responsible for the effects of individual nutrients at the cellular
and molecular levels has evolved into a more holistic aim of understanding the role
of combinations of nutrients and foods in dietary patterns as key determinants of
health and disease. These archetypes of eating are also linked to social, behavioural,
cultural, geographical, and environmental factors that impact health maintenance and
prevention of disease risk.
We have reviewed the characteristics of the dietary patterns, which hitherto
have accumulated more evidence on their associations with prolonged survival

and decreased incidence of NCDs. World areas where exceptional longevity has
been observed, the so called “Blue Zones”, follow this type of dietary patterns,
namely Mediterranean, Japanese/Okinawan, and vegetarian. These dietary patterns
share common features that have been linked to healthy ageing mechanisms, i.e.,
use of plant-based foods and whole grain products, which are plenty of fibre,
vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
actions; consumption of high mono- and polyunsaturated fats with cardio-protective
potential; moderate intake of protein, most of plant origin, with the exception of
moderate consumption of fish; use of herbs and spices, rich in antioxidant and antiinflammatory effects; moderate o no alcohol consumption; low or no consumption
of red and processed meat, processed and ultra-processed foods and sugar, which
have been associated with an increased risk of obesity, T2D, CVD, and some types of
cancer. The beneficial dietary components, as well as the other lifestyle determinants
(i.e., physical activity) together with moderation in food consumption observed in
populations adhering to these dietary patterns, may subject the body to a positive
stress (hormesis) able to counteract the ageing process (Rattan 2014).
Thus, accumulating scientific evidence point to the crucial role of diet in the
modification of ageing mechanisms and in the genesis of age-associated diseases
ranging from CVD to cancer. Further undertakings are needed to integrate these
healthy dietary and lifestyle choices into daily living in communities worldwide to
make healthy eating more accessible and sustainable.

##### **Chapter 16**
#### **Ketogenic Diet, Circadian Rhythm** **and Aging**

**Anita Jagota and Sushree Abhidhatri Sharma**

**Abstract** Circadian rhythms are manifested as a series of autonomous and endogenous oscillators and are generated by the molecular circadian clock system in order
to coordinate the internal time with the exogenous environmental changes in a 24
hour (h) daily cycle. In mammals, Suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is regarded as
the master clock, as it is entrained by the environmental cues and in turn synchronizes the peripheral clocks. Desynchronization between master clock and peripheral clocks give rise to many cellular, physiological and pathological alterations. In
recent years, the focus is on establishing dietary regimes as therapeutic interventions. Ketogenic diet (KD) is one such dietary regimen characterized by relatively
higher fat and protein proportions in diet than the carbohydrates, which recapitulates
certain metabolic aspects of fatty acid metabolism and production of ketone bodies
(KBs). KD which is comprised of saturated triglycerides polyunsaturated fatty acids
(PUFAs) appears to be beneficial in improving age associated perturbations. This
chapter focuses on the therapeutic effects of KD on healthy aging as well as unravelling the connection between KD and circadian rhythm, hence further establishing
rationale for the KD regime as a therapeutic intervention.

###### **16.1 Introduction**

A self-entrained endogenous biological clock (circadian clock) is present in every
living organism from unicellular to multicellular in order to maintain the synchrony
with the day and night cycle. Biological clock has its own rhythm and periodicity
called biological rhythm. When this biological rhythm persists under constant conditions and having periodicity of approximately one day or 24 h, it is called as circadian A. Jagota ( B ) · S. A. Sharma

rhythm (Jagota et al. 2000). In mammals the circadian system is comprised of a hierarchyofoscillators,inwhichSCNofthehypothalamusisregardedasthemasterclock
regulating downstream oscillators in peripheral tissues called as peripheral clocks
such as liver, kidney, intestine etc. (Ko and Takahashi 2006). The master pacemaker
coupled population of neuronal circadian oscillators perceives the external photic
cues (light) and in turn synchronizes the peripheral clocks. Thus SCN plays a major
role in orchestrating cellular and metabolic processes by relaying temporal information to the entire body via humoral and neural communication (Walker et al. 2020).
In SCN, the circadian molecular machinery consists of two tightly interlocked feedback loops that comprise of core clock genes such as *Clock, Bmal1, Per1, Per2, Per3,*
*Cry1, Cry2* etc.
Aging is an inevitable phenomena characterized by progressive decline in physiological functions and cognitive impairments. Several evidences have suggested
that aging is associated with dysfunction in 24-h circadian rhythms due to loss
of synchronization between the master clock and peripheral clocks leading to a
myriad of complications in cellular, hormonal and metabolic processes. Reports
from our laboratory suggest that there are alterations in daily rhythms of serotonin
(JagotaandKalyani 2008; 2010),antioxidantenzymes(ManikondaandJagota 2012),
leptin (Reddy and Jagota 2014), clock genes (Mattam and Jagota 2014), serotonin
metabolism (Reddy and Jagota 2015), NO and Socs expression rhythms (Vinod and
Jagota 2016; 2017) with aging. Further we have also reported various herbal therapeutic interventions such as curcumin and hydro-alcoholic leaf extract of *Withania*
*somnifera* towards the restoration of various clock genes, immune genes, *Sirt1* and
nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2( *Nrf2* ) upon aging (Kukkemane and Jagota
2019; Thummadi and Jagota 2019; Kukkemane and Jagota 2020).
Studies on the dietary regime and its possible therapeutic intervention has become
pivotal in the field of research over the last few decades. Diet has been very vital as it is
regarded as the non-photic cue, therefore the nutrient composition and dietary pattern
play major role in regulating metabolic, cellular processes by entraining as well as
reinstating peripheral clocks. Many dietary interventions have been identified by
various scientists such as ketogenic diet (KD), low-fat diet (LFD), low-carbohydrate
diet, high-protein diet (HPD) and high-fat diet (HFD) etc. KD has been used to treat
pathological conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome, acne, neurological diseases,
obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus type 2, cancer, respiratory and cardiovascular disease etc. KD can be an effective therapy in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS), AD, PD and some mitochondriopathies (Paoli et al. 2014). Therefore in this
chapter, we focus on the role of KD in restoration of circadian function, and acting
as an anti-aging regime, thus promoting longevity (Fig. 16.1).

are various types of KD available based on their composition (Table 16.1). Further
various reports pertaining to the side effects of KD have been listed in Table 16.2.
###### ***16.2.1 Ketogenic Diet and Circadian Rhythm***

Various reports regarding the effects of KD on circadian rhythm have been listed in
Table 16.3. The concept of chrono-nutrition has gained the limelight over the last few
years. The digestion and absorption of nutrients is regulated by CTS as the process
relies on the circadian rhythm of digestive enzymes, membrane transporters and the
migrating motility complex etc. Peripheral clocks are not only entrained by the master
clock but can also be entrained by non-photic cues such as sound, humidity, different
kinds of diets, dietary patterns and temperature (Jagota et al. 2019). KD might lead to
shifting of the peripheral/slave clock which in turn can increase intestinal absorption
of nutrients through the over-expression of some transporters. Itokawa et al. (2013)
demonstrated timing of nutrient intake and its composition caused a phase shift in
the rhythm of expression of *Per2* in the liver. Further, *Per2* expression in liver is
essential during ketogenesis as it is regarded as the direct regulator of expression of a

an indirect regulator of rate-limiting enzyme mitochondrial hydroxymethyl glutarylCoA synthase ( *Hmgcs2* ) for ketogenesis from the resulting acetyl-CoA (Chavan et al.
2016).
Tognini et al. (2017) demonstrated that KD affected the peripheral clocks such as
liver and intestine differently. KD regime led to increase in the amplitude of various
clock control genes (CCGs) expression in liver as well as tissue-specific oscillation
of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and its target genes.

                                                  However, the amplitude of CCGs was not drastically altered in the intestine. β
hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) levels in the serum and intestine were found to oscillate
robustly in a circadian manner. Oishi et al. (2009) reported that KD resulted in not
only phase advance but also in shortening of free running period in mice. KD led to

an increase in lipolysis, loss of body weight and advanced the onset of both daily
locomotor activity and behavioural rhythms in mice and was also responsible in
regulation of gene expression of core clock in peripheral tissues.
Upon KD regime, in Kcna1 knockout epileptic mice, there was phase shift of
Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) mediated diurnal rest activity rhythms. There was reduction of
number and periodicity of seizures, restoring normal behavioural rhythms (FenoglioSimeone et al. 2009). The circulating levels of ketone bodies (KBs) have been
reported to increase with KD regime. Fasting induces ketogenic genes under regulation of mTOR–PPARα axis regulated by CTS. KD has also been reported to
elevate transcriptional activation of CCG’s by targeting CLOCK:BMAL1 complex
and upregulates *DBP*, a clock output gene in the liver, kidney, heart, and adipose
tissue (Oishi et al. 2009).
###### ***16.2.2 Ketogenic Diet and Aging***

Various studies related to the effects of KD on aging, lifespan and longevity have
been listed in Table 16.4. The key pathways and the molecular mechanisms to
improve lifespan and longevity are controlled by behavioural, pharmacological
and dietary factors. KD when administered alternatively with the control diet on
weekly basis (Cyclic KD), helped to reduce obesity, midlife mortality and improved
memory performance though the maximum lifespan remained unaffected. Further
KD intervention led to down regulation of insulin, protein synthesis, and fatty acid
synthesis pathways, whereas PPARα target genes were up regulated which were
consistent across tissues, and preserved in old age, thus KD was found to improve
survival, memory, and lifespan in aging mice (Newman et al. 2017). Another study
reported that when 12 months old C57BL/6 mice were given KD, it significantly
maintained physiological functions, improved longevity and lifespan compared to
controls. Further KD was found to elevate protein acetylation levels and regulate
tissue specific mTORC1 signalling (Roberts et al. 2017). KD has been reported to
result in reduction in the oxidative and endoplasmic stress and turnover of proteins.
It also improved antioxidant cellular status and preserved oxidative muscle fibers in
mice, thus beneficial in maintaining muscle mass, function and preventing sarcopenia
with the progression of age (Wallace et al. 2021) ***16.2.3 Ketogenic Diet Modulation of Epigenetic Mechanisms***

Acetylation and deacetylation of histones are two key mechanisms of histone modifications. Recent research in the field of aging has shown that inhibition of histone
deactylases (HDACs) and increased histone acetylation plays protective role in
various age associated diseased models. β-OHB led to inhibition of class I and class II
HDACs in turn influencing age-associated gene expression (Han et al. 2020). Recent

and histone covalent post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as histone lysine
acetylation (β-hydroxybutyrylation at lysins of histones (Kbhb)), histone methylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination. β-hydroxybutyrylation of histones is also
associated with active gene promoters (Dabek et al. 2020). KD therapy modulates
epigenetic modifications by histone phosphorylation, acetylation and DNA methylation (Ruan and Crawford 2018). KD treatment was beneficial for the restoration of
DNA methylation status in rodent models. KD intervention led to increased levels of
NAD+modulatingNAD+-dependentenzymes,includingSirtuinswhichareinvolved
in deacetylation processes (Elamin et al. 2018). Further DNA methylation maybe
blocked by elevated levels of adenosines during intake of KD. Hence KD intervention recapitulates a novel epigenetic mechanism which may be helpful in slowing

down the aging process and preventing age associated dysfunctions (Paoli et al.
2014).
###### ***16.2.4 Effects of Ketogenic Diet on Longevity***

Douris et al. (2015) demonstrated that the group of mice fed lifelong with KD had
reduced catabolic processes as well as shift in amino acid metabolism, and conserving
amino acid levels. They also showed increased levels of energy expenditure, elevated
levels of circulating β-OHB, triglycerides, improved glucose homeostasis, up regulated fibroblast growth factor 21 expression in the liver but down-regulated lipogenic
enzymes such as stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 and reduced fat mass compared to chowfed controls. Thus, long-term KD intervention led to persistent health promoting
metabolic changes without affecting survival in case of mice. Further KD might affect
quality as well as quantity of mitochondria, hence beneficial in ameliorating oxidative stress by increased levels of hepatic superoxide dismutase 1, catalase antioxidant protein, elevated volume of mitochondria in liver and gastrocnemius as well as
increased median lifespan (762 days) compared to control group (624 days) (Parry
et al. 2018). Switch between glycolysis and ketosis is helpful in promoting survival
by accelerating metabolism through fat oxidation during fasting. KD along with time
restricted feeding (TRF) have proven to be more beneficial (Hernandez et al. 2020). ***16.2.5 Clinical Studies***

Rosenbaum et al. (2019) demonstrated that in humans after switching from baseline diet (BD) (15% protein, 50% carbohydrate, 35% fat) to isocaloric KD (15%
protein, 5% carbohydrate, 80% fat) there was increase in the gastric inhibitory
peptide, fasting ketones, glucagon, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, free fatty
acids, adiponectin, C-reactive protein and inflammatory markers. On the other hand,
fasting insulin, triglycerides, C-peptides, fibroblast growth factor 21 and insulinmediated anti-lipolysis were significantly decreased. However, parameters associated with glucose homeostasis were diet and test meal dependent. In another study,
Phillips et al. (2018) reported that physiological ketosis was found to be maintained in
group of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) patients following KD regime with improvements
in both motor and nonmotor symptoms. Various clinical studies have suggested that
KD has been beneficial in alleviating many pathophysiological conditions in case of
age associated neurodegenerative diseases such as PD, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD),
Dementia etc. thus improving survival and lifespan (Davis et al. 2021).

###### **16.3 Mechanism of Action of KD**

The mechanism of KD action is mainly through the process of ketogenesis involving
oxidation of fatty acids and ketogenic amino acids which leads to the production
of Ketone bodies (KBs) such as β-OHB, acetoacetate (ACA) and acetone (Longo
et al. 2019). The latter is the least abundant. The site for the production of these KBs
are mainly mitochondria of hepatocytes as well as kidney epithelia, astrocytes and
enterocytes (Grabackaet al. 2016).
KDisoftenconsideredasabiochemicalmodeloffasting.Sinceithaslowcarbohydrate content, administration of KD forces the body physiology to enter into a fasting
state by switching the energy production from glucose metabolism to energy production through metabolism of fatty acids (FAs) and KBs formation. KD has proved to
be efficient in improving metabolism, energy production and various physiological
parameters without the need of starvation. KD administration leads to reduced blood
glucose concentration and insulin-to-glucagon ratio. It also causes increased concentration of glucagon, reduced glucose concentration and inhibition of glycogenesis
(Włodarek 2019).
The mechanism of action of KD based on literature review has been schematically
represented in Fig. 16.3. ***16.3.1 Ketone Body: Energy Metabolism***

Brain is comparatively less capable in utilizing FAs, therefore it has to utilize KBs
synthesized in the liver as an energy source during intake of KD (McDonald and
Cervenka 2018). It is reported that β-OHB and ACA can enter into the brain with
the help of proton-linked, monocarboxylic acid transporters crossing the blood brain
barrier (BBB). The expression of these particular transporters depends on the level
of ketosis. Reports have suggested that KBs are efficient source of energy rather than
glucose as they can undergo metabolism faster compared to glucose and because of
their ability to enter directly into the Krebs cycle bypassing the glycolytic pathway
(Elamin et al. 2018; McDonald and Cervenka 2018). KD also inhibits glycolysis
and FA utilization, therefore glycolytic ATP production is drastically reduced and
ATP generation by mitochondrial oxidation is dramatically elevated (Veyrat-Durebex
et al. 2018). Study has indicated that KD up regulates the expression of hippocampal
genes for mitochondrial enzymes of energy metabolism (Bough et al. 2006).

**Fig. 16.3** Schematic representation of the effects of ketogenic diet (KD) on circadian rhythm
dysfunction, longevity and lifespan: peripheral clocks which are under the regulation of master
clock (SCN) are also entrained by KD which in turn give signals to SCN. KD intervention led to
increase in the amplitude of various clock control genes (CCGs) expression in the liver, whereas
expression of CCGs remained unaltered in intestine. Up regulation of *DBP*, a clock output gene in
the liver, kidney, heart, and adipose tissue was observed after KD therapy contributing to increased
longevity. β-hydroxybutarate (β-OHB), one of the ketone bodies (KBs) binds with the hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA2) receptor present on the inflammatory cells (Peripheral clocks)
such as microglia, macrophages and dendritic cells resulting into production of Prostaglandin D2
(PGD2) by COX1 which activates neuroprotective macrophages. Further KD helps in reducing
pro-inflammatory cytokines levels, down regulating NF-κB pathway, increasing anti-inflammatory
cytokines levels as well as neurotrophic factors leading to increased longevity, lifespan. KD acts
through Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) to reduce oxidative stress, elevate antioxidant status, increase levels of
heat shock proteins, enhance DNA repair activity of (FOXO), p53, increase deacetylation of nuclear
factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) which are beneficial for improving longevity and lifespan
###### **16.4 Mechanisms Involved in Therapeutic Effects of KD** **Enhancing Lifespan and Longevity** ***16.4.1 Reducing Inflammation***

Inflammation is one of the hallmarks of aging and the link between aging and inflammation is depicted as “Inflammaging”. Many age-associated diseases are associated
with elevated level of inflammatory cells such as macrophages, increased circulatory
levels of pro-inflammatory molecules. KD inhibits nuclear factor kappa-light-chainenhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) activation, which is very crucial in neuroinflammation condition (Rahman et al. 2014). KD also down regulates expression of
nitric oxide synthase and COX2 as well as of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1b,
IL-6, CCL2/MCP-1,TNF-α (Dupuis et al. 2015). Reports have also suggested that,

β-OHB may alleviate upsurge of inflammatory cytokines (Hao et al. 2012). Moreover, an innate immune sensor NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome which
regulates caspase-1 activation and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such
as IL-1β and IL-18 by reducing the K+ efflux from cells is prohibited by ketones
(Veyrat-Durebex et al. 2018; McDonald and Cervenka 2018).
###### ***16.4.2 Reducing Oxidative Stress***

ROS are responsible for the damage to DNA, lipids, and proteins leading to apoptosis
of cells which further play a vital role in pathophysiology of many age associated
disorders. KD intervention increases ketone body formation leading to ketosis thus
resulting in ROS. Such a change could involve by passing complex 1 in electron transport chain in mitochondria, improving mitochondrial respiration as well as increasing
NAD [+] /NADH ratio which may further improve cellular respiration, redox reactions
and mitochondrial biogenesis (Yang and Sauve 2016).
Elamin et al. (2018) reported that rats administrated with KD had increased ratio
of NAD [+] /NADH in brain cortex and hippocampus after two days of intervention.
KD induces SIRT1 which has pleotropic action such as limiting oxidative stress,
increasing heat shock proteins production, enhancing DNA repairing activity of fork
head transcription factor (FOXO) and protein p53 as well as deacetylating Nrf2
(Zelin and Freeman 2015). Nrf2 induces the enzymes such as glutathione reductase,
peroxiredoxin, thioredoxin which help in synthesis of active form of endogenous
antioxidant agents and alleviates oxidative stress by enhancing the expression of an
antioxidantproteinhemeoxygenase-1(HO-1)(Chorleyetal. 2012).Itisalsoreported
that KD improves the level of glutathione and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in
the hippocampus (Bough et al. 2006). **16.5 Neuroprotective Activity**

Neuroinflammation is evident with the progression of age giving rise to many pathological conditions such as PD and AD. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunctions play essential role in creating neuroinflammatory environment, which ultimately leads to neurodegeneration. KD exerts its neuroprotective effect by increased
production of KBs, which lead to more ATP production and less ROS production, hence improving the efficiency of mitochondrial respiration. Reports have also
suggested that KD is rich in PUFAs, which are believed to protect the neurons
by reducing free radicals, incident of inflammatory environment and controlling
nerve-cell excitability. Further it modulates neuronal membrane receptors leading
to increased concentration of brain ATP, phosphocreatine and induces mitochondrial biogenesis (Bough et al. 2006). The immune cells present in the brain express
GPR109A, which is a G protein-coupled receptor called hydroxy-carboxylic acid

receptor 2 (HCA2) (Yang et al. 2019). KD targets the neuroinflammatory process, as
β-OHBbindtoHCA2receptorpresentonmicroglia,dendriticcells,andmacrophages
resulting into Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) production by COX1 and activation of neuroprotective macrophages, eventually ameliorating neuroinflammation (Taggart et al.
2005; Yang et al. 2019). In vitro studies have shown that β-OHB inhibited histone
deacetylases (HDACs) such as 1, 3 and 4 (class I and II a), restoring memory function
and improving synaptic plasticity (Bough et al. 2006).The neuroprotective effect of
KD has been also depicted by its ability to reduce the glycemic index i.e. reduced
glycolysis, which act as caloric restriction contributing to increase in lifespan of
various species (Włodarek 2019). It has also been suggested that KD modifies gut
microbiota which help in protecting against various seizures (Olson et al. 2018).
Moreover KD improves resistance and adaptability of neuronal cells against stress
and metabolic challenges (Veyrat-Durebex et al. 2018). It also stabilizes synaptic
plasticity, activates ATP-sensitive potassium channels, enhances neurotrophic factors
activity and fights against neurotoxic environment (McDonald and Cervenka 2018;
Włodarek 2019).
###### **16.6 Neurotrophic Factors**

KD regulates the level of neuroprotective mediators such as brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and glial cell line-derived
neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Few have reported that KD regime may result in the
circadian shift in the expression of BDNF in the liver though BDNF level is actually
reduced in striatum (Włodarek 2019) (Fig. 16.3). **16.7 Conclusion**

KD is a modified dietary regime, which advances the onset of locomotor activity
rhythms and daily behavioural rhythms in mice. KD affects circadian rhythm of
peripheral clocks differentially by regulating core clock mechanism in the peripheral tissues. It also contributes towards improving memory, cognitive abilities and
lifespan during aging process. It has been proven to be beneficial in mitigating various
factors contributing to aging, age-associated neurodegenerative disorders as well as
other pathologies like cancer, respiratory, cardiovascular disease, obesity, metabolic
syndrome, and diabetes mellitus type 2. Hence KD may be considered as the potential therapeutic intervention as it improves physiological functions, maintains brain
health thus leading to a healthy survival strategy and longevity.

##### **Chapter 17**
#### **Diet According to Traditional Chinese** **Medicine for Health and Longevity**

**Yifang Zhang**

**Abstract** Diet nutritional therapy is a primary mode of healing used in Traditional
Chinese medicine (TCM) to prevent and treat disease. While modern medicine has
only recently recognized that proper nutrition is foundational to human health, they
often fail to understand its therapeutic importance. For centuries, TCM physicians
have integrated diet therapies into their healing practices providing a detailed knowledge of the healing power of common foods, including the integration of herbal
medicines into dietetics. This chapter addresses the key philosophies underlying
Chinese medical dietetics, underscores the importance of a healthy digestive system
as the basis of human health, and provides guidance on how foods and botanicals
can maintain, restore, and build health and achieve healthy longevity.
##### Keywords Aging · Lifespan · Food · Diet · Health · Yin-yang
###### **17.1 Introduction**

The chapter lays out how to think about and pragmatically adapt one’s diet according
to TCM to optimize for health and longevity. It first goes through the basic theories
of the TCM related to diet, such as understanding food nature and flavor from the
theories of the Yin-Yang, the Five Elements and using the meridian and organ theory
to explain the pertinence of foods. It then explains the TCM aspects of the digestive
system and details of the different body constitution, and allows the reader to selfassess where they stand. Building on those first two parts, it then explains how to
regulate one’s diet based on one’s body constitution, age, gender and according to
seasons and geographic location. Finally yet importantly, this chapter shares with the
readers some of TCM’s best wisdom on diet for health and longevity. For example,
providing vivid examples on how to maintain one’s brain function while ageing, how
to regulate and boost immunity, how to prevent illness, how to tackle common or
serious illness and it arises and so on. Y. Zhang ( B )

There is a Chinese proverb saying, diet is linked with both the body and soul.
Food and medicine share the same roots, which means that foods and daily diet not
only provide nutrition and delicious flavors, but also bring energy, happiness, and are
important for optimal health. In China, functional nutrition draws on thousands of
years of culture, based on TCM, which recognizes that dietary regimens and herbal
tonics are a source of healing and defense, can strengthen the body, maintain fitness,
prevent and cure illnesses, and contribute greatly to longevity and prosperity. The
approach of TCM is, at its core, using nature, alternative-healing methods, tailored
to the individual’s body and needs. However, people may ask how can one maintain
good health, prevent and treat illness, and at the same time enjoy delicious cuisine?
The Yellow Emperor’s Canon of Medicine is the earliest existing Chinese medical
classic, and the source of Chinese medical theory and herbs. TCM doctors have been
applying its theory in hospitals and clinics. The Yellow Emperor’s Canon of Medicine
states that medicine inhibits illness. Five Chinese traditional grains (rice, red beans,
wheat, soybeans, millet) can be used to nourish the body. There are five kinds of
fruits (peach, plum, apricot, chestnut, Jujube) which can be used to assist the five
kinds of grains to fulfil such functions. The five kinds of livestock (cow, goat, pig,
and chicken) can be used to supplement the internal organs. Five kinds of vegetables
(sunflowers, leaves of bean, onions, scallion, Chinese chive) can be used to enrich
the viscera. When the energy and flavor of foods harmonize, people can strengthen
their body essence and increase their Qi (energy) (Yang et al. translation Li and Liu
2005).
Based on the above classic literature, we have learned the following three lessons.
First, the choice of daily food ingredients should include a rich variety of grains,
vegetables, fruits, and proteins to balance nutrition. Second, foods have their own
energy and flavors, suited for different health conditions. Third, balanced energy and
flavors of foods have therapeutic effects on the human body, especially strengthening
the essence and increasing Qi. TCM find that there is a close relationship between
people’s spirit and health. Food can nourish the spirit, which influences our health
status. TCM widens the spectrum, and creates a link between essence, Qi and spirit
with food. Moreover, essence, Qi and spirit have a particularly important impact on
human health and longevity.
###### **17.2 TCM Basic Theories Related to Diet**

The TCM concept of a healthy diet includes establishing a broad, balanced food base,
making food easy to digest and absorb, while also ensuring that the food quantities
are suited to each individual, and taking into consideration the climate change and
regional differences. TCM finds food affects our daily Yin (interior energy)-Yang
(exterior energy) balance. Because foods are categorized as either Yin or Yang in
their nature, they can be used as an effective healing method to maintain and re-build
equilibrium of body energy.


-----

17 Diet According to Traditional Chinese Medicine … 333

Building up a healthy diet is a way to attain physical, emotional, and mental
wellness. To achieve a healthy balance, one needs to understand TCM concepts of
foods and herbs, and healthy diet first.
###### ***17.2.1 Understanding of Food Nature from TCM Theories*** ***of Yin-Yang***

Choosing the foods and herbs that are right for us is essential to achieving and
maintaining good health. Daily diet is closely related to the temperature change of
the day and the alternation of the mild, cold and hot seasons. Therefore, TCM uses
Yin and Yang to define the cold, hot, warmth, and coolness of the four energies of
food. Yin and Yang are the two fundamental principles or forces in the universe,
ever opposing and supplementing each other. This ancient philosophical concept has
become an important component of the basic theory of TCM. In the beginning, Yin
and Yang described a location in relation to the sun. A place exposed to the sun is
Yang, and a place without exposure is Yin. The southern side of a mountain, for
example, is Yang, while its northern side is Yin. Thus the ancient Chinese people,
during their everyday life and work, came to understand that all aspects of the natural
world could be seen as having a dual aspect. For example: day and night, brightness
and dimness, movement and stillness, upward and downward directions, heat and
cold, etc. (Zhang et al. 1989).
The terms Yin and Yang express these dual and opposite qualities of food and
how to achieve balance. This is an inherent property and not necessarily dependent
on the food temperature. Yang food means that its energy creates warmth or heat
when taking them. For instance, eating chili warms the body. “Flavor” can also be
defined as a Yin and Yang. Yang taste includes pungent, sweet or bland. Yang cooking
or preparation methods include stir-frying, stewing, baking, deep-frying, roasting,
grilling or barbecue (Leggett 1994). These foods and herbs make our energy rise to
the body’s surface.
Yin food means that the energy of foods is cool or cold, and the tastes sour, bitter
or salty. Yin cooking or preparation methods include steam or eating raw (Leggett
1994). Yin foods restrain the body’s energy and cause it to descend. Many foods
have very mild Yin or Yang qualities therefore defined as “neutral”. Examples of
such foods include rice, corn, kale and carrots.
Even if we do not have detailed knowledge about the Yin and Yang of food, if we
consume a broad range of foods (rainbow-colored food), we can quite naturally get
a balance of Yin and Yang.

###### ***17.2.2 Understanding of Food Flavor from TCM Theories*** ***of Five Elements***

Through taste and experience, the wise ancestors not only found the food for human
survival, but also found the medical herbs to treat illness. Ancestors discovered the
method of determining the action and properties of foods and herbs through tasting
and the cold and heat reaction of the human body after eating, and gradually formed
a relatively perfect theory of the properties of TCM herbs, based on “four Qi and five
flavors”. Because different tastes have different effects on the human body, through
the theory of Five Elements, we can better understand the relationship between food
flavor and the human body.
In Chinese, the Five Elements are Wu Xing—Wu means five and Xing means
movement and change. The Five Elements are wood, fire, earth, metal and water.
These elements each have their own special properties, which are at the root of the
ancient philosophical concepts used in TCM.
Although the Chinese theory of Five Elements and the Greek theory of Four
Elements are different in their history of formation, the rudiments of both belong to
the earliest atomic theory. In order to explain the material world around them, ancient
philosophers made a generalization and deduction about the respective properties of
the substances and their interactive relationships. According to Chinese theory, wood,
fire, earth, metal and water are the five basic substances that constitute the material
world. They each have their own specific properties, but they also have interactive
generation and restriction functions, and are in a constant state of motion and change
(Zhang et al. 1989).
Five Elements theory believes that food has different colors and bring varied
tastes. Tastes have certain effects on the body as described below.
*Sour:* Suchashawthorn,lemonanddrieddarkplum.Thistastehelpswithdigestive
absorption, resisting fatty foods and preventing indigestion. It generates fluids and
Yin, and stops discharge, perspiration, chronic cough and diarrhea. It also has an
astringent effect on emissions, including sperm and frequent urination. It helps our
body consolidate essential substances, preventing them from escaping. Sour foods
can also bring disordered Qi back to normal. Modern research shows sour flavors to
be generally cleansing and detoxifying. However, we have to limit intake when ulcer

or stones are present.

*Bitter:* Suchasaloeveraandgreentea.Thistasteclearsawayheatanddriesdampness.
It can control abnormally ascending Qi and purge any pathogenic fire effect. In certain
combinations, it can also improve the body’s Yin. Bitter foods can be used to treat
most cases of excess and acute damp-heat or heat-fire. These foods should be limited
if a weakness of Qi and Blood is present.

*Sweet:* Such as jujube and honey. Serving to nourish, moisten, moderate and invigorate the body, sweet foods can also regulate Qi, Blood and function of the viscera.
They strengthen deficiency syndrome and alleviate dryness. Sweet foods work in
coordination with the spleen and stomach. They can help relieve pain and spasms,


-----

17 Diet According to Traditional Chinese Medicine … 335

and reduce cough, ulcer and constipation. An excess of sweets should be avoided
when suffering from damp, phlegm and water retention conditions.

*Spicy (Pungent):* Such as ginger, Sichuan pepper and clove. This taste disperses and
promotes movement of Qi and Blood circulation. It stimulates digestion and helps
break through blockage. It treats syndromes of the exterior, and expels stagnation of
Qi, Blood and pathogens. Spicy foods must be used carefully as many people cannot
tolerate them.

*Salty:* Such as marine algae and kelp. These foods can promote moisture and have a
softening effect. In particular, these foods regulate the moisture balance flow downwards in the body. They also move Qi downward, increase urine and bowel movements, and are used to treat constipation and swelling. They promote the action of
the kidney system, allowing beneficial foods to be fully absorbed and functional,
and improving concentration. Salty foods soften nodes and masses, and disperse
accumulations in hardening muscles and glands.

*Bland:* Such as dolichos seed and pearl barley. This taste promotes urination and
treats edema.
###### ***17.2.3 Using Meridian and Organ Theory to Explain*** ***the Pertinence of Food***

Over its long history, Chinese medicine has come to realize that different foods enter
specific meridian pathways, directing their effect towards particular organs, that is to
say knowledge of the metabolic trend of food in the human body. This information
directs the therapeutic use of the food (Zhang et al. 1989). When we know which
meridian or organ a food will target, this is useful in treating a disorder of that particular meridian or organ. For instance, onion enters the lung meridian and lung, while
lychee targets the liver meridian and liver. Peppers affect the stomach meridian and
stomach; sunflower seeds, the spleen meridian and spleen; kidney beans, naturally,
the kidney meridian and kidney; and coffee, the heart and its meridian. **17.3 TCM Aspects of the Digestive System and Body** **Constitution**

Over thousands of years TCM has accumulated knowledge about using foods and
herbs therapeutically, providing natural and alternative way to boost energy and
immunity, regulate one’s mood, enhance one’s beauty, reduce toxins and treat other
health conditions, externally and internally. TCM believes that the human body is
madeupoffivesystems.Thesefivesystemsarerelatedtothedigestionandabsorption

of food, the transportation and metabolism of nutrients. In this paper, we focus on
the structure and function of the digestive system and body constitution.
###### ***17.3.1 Understanding the Digestive System***

“We are what we eat” was a popular saying in the 1990’s, although it is only partially
true. “We are what we eat and absorb” would be a better expression of the facts. What
we absorb is dependent upon how healthy our spleen system is. According to Chinese
medical theory, the spleen is the “Agricultural Bureau” of the body, controlling where
energy “seeds” are planted and how the health of the body is harvested. The spleen is
the post-natal base of life, the source of acquired constitution. This means that once all
the congenital factors of the body have been determined, one’s health development
relies on the spleen to do the rest of the work. The spleen directs digestion and
absorption, governs Blood flow within the vessels. Therefore, the spleen system is
considered the “source of Qi and Blood.” In TCM, the spleen and stomach make up
the digestive system, which includes the pancreas, small intestine, and part of the
stomach functions. It is related to digestion, water metabolism, and hemopoiesis in
modern medicine. Below we provide a self-assessment for people to understand the
digestive system.

If the number of yes responses is 4 or more, one’s digestive system is relatively
weak, and cannot tolerate excessively cold, hot, acid and heavy food. These people
needs to adjust their digestive system. By contrast, if the number of yes responses is
less than 4, these people merely need to maintain a healthy diet.
###### ***17.3.2 Understanding Body Constitution***

Body constitution comprises our physical state, including the morphology, function
ofourinternalsystems,andmetabolism,alongwithourmentalandspiritualstates.As
we pass through life, everyone’s physical constitution goes through periods of relative
balance and imbalance, for example, passing from hot to cold or strong to weak. An
imbalance of our physical constitution can mark a transitional stage, when we are
shifting away from health towards disorder, but before disease develops. Therefore,
maintaining balance in our physical constitution can prevent or lessen disease and
promote recovery from illness. TCM strives to balance the physical constitution,
mitigate shock from the outside environment, and dissolve toxic substances within
the body.
The features of one’s constitution can be detected in three areas: the physical
build of the person, the body’s internal functions, and the psychological state. It also
depends on the stage of life the person is in, such as puberty or menopause.
The constitution has two origins: congenital natural disposition and post-natal
lifestyle (i.e. nature and nurture). Many factors influence the formation of the constitution, such as the parents’ health, physically and mentally, the time of conception,
and the mother’s condition during pregnancy. These are all part of the congenital
natural disposition of one’s constitution. However, most of the influence comes from
our own actions and lifestyle. We care more about how each person’s digestive system
operates, in order to cooperate best with a good choice of foods.
Below we have provided a self-assessment for people to learn more about cold
and hot, weakness and overly strong, neutral and mixes of body constitution.

Assessment:

Neutral: 6 or more responses of (1)
Weak: 6 or more of (3)
Overly Strong: 6 or more of (2)
Mixes: if fewer than 6 of any one response.

In completing the above self-assessment, we encounter some pairs of concepts:
cold or hot, damp or dry, weak or overly strong. All of these values in a medial range
are normal. It is normal to feel cold in the winter and hot in the summer. However, if
one always feel cold even in warm seasons, then should seek the underlying reasons
and try some food remedies. The approach toward damp and dry is similar to cold
and hot. People feel wet in humid season and dehydrated in the dry season. These
feelings are normal within boundaries. Dampness nourishes our inside and moistens
the surface of skin while dryness limits the growth of mold. However, too much
dampness makes skin oily and develop acne. In contrast, too much dryness causes
skin to wrinkle and crack. Therefore, it is best to maintain a neutral status.
After an assessment of body constitution, one can choose the right foods and
herbs to achieve and maintain a healthy balance. Let us take damp, dry and neutral
constitutions as examples. Neutral type means that one is in healthy balance. In
order to maintain this state, this person should eat a broad range of foods, and drink
water according to the climate and level of perspiration. However, if one has a damp
constitution, too much wet is carried inside. One has to add specific foods to the diet
(such as pearl barley, azuki beans, corn) to reduce dampness. As for the dry type, one
should take foods such as lily bulb, Chinese wolfberry, honey or lemon to nourish
and moisten the body.
###### **17.4 How to Match Diet with Body Variety and Avoid** **Blight**

Chinesedietarytherapy(shiliao) applies foods andherbs toachievehealthpromotion,
prevention and treating diseases, rehabilitation, and healing from diseases.
When applying food and diet for those purposes we need to think of the points
below.


-----

342 Y. Zhang
###### ***17.4.1 Food According to Constitution, Age and Sex***

Food and dietary recommendations by TCM theory are usually made according to
the person’s individual constitution and condition.
It is important to ensure that people’s diet are aligned with their personal nature.
People with a Yang constitution are usually by nature more active and forceful. They
do not tolerate heat well, so in the warmer summer months, they must eat more Yin
foods and reduce their intake of hot or spicy foods. The more gentle nature of these
Yin foods will bring one’s Yang nature into balance. By contrast, those with a Yin
constitution are often quieter and less energetic. They have a low tolerance for cold,
so should consume more Yang foods, which are warm or hot, and should add spice
to boost their energy.
Two women with the same illness and same age group can have completely
different food therapies because their constitutions are opposite. For treating
migraine, a person feeling hot, sharp pains, a flushed face, and frequent perspiration, should use chamomile due to its cooling and bitter qualities and its ability to
target the liver meridian. A person with a splitting headache on the top of head or
the whole head, spreading over the eyes and temple areas, feeling cold from their
body to their head, induced by cold and rain, and likes pressure and warmth, needs to
utilize dry ginger, and angelica dahurica which are warm, hot and spicy. A student of
mine applies dietary therapy to treat more than 60 women suffering from migraines
with over 80% experiencing positive results.
Children, adults and seniors may not use the same ingredients or the same dosage
to treat a symptom because their constitutions are different. From the age of 24
to 35, people should focus on preventative measures. They should do all things in
moderation (for example, food consumption or working hours), and keep a balanced
emotional state. For this group it is best to choose more ingredients that are neutral.
From the age of 36 to 65, people should focus on preventing chronic and more
serious illnesses, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high blood sugar.
It is important to take notice of any hereditary diseases and take extra steps toward
prevention. This age group should also be sure to consume foods that contain Qi
tonics and nourish Blood and body fluids.
At the age of 66 and above, health care should focus on harmonizing the organ
systems. Special attention should be given to the digestive, circulatory, cardiovascular
and metabolic systems, regardless of whether or not they suffer from ailments. In the
younger age group, people may tend to consume a great deal of fruits or vegetables as
a main source of fiber. In China, people over the age of 80 do not consume much fruit
during the winter months. Their source of fiber will be more from root vegetables,
like potatoes, yam, sweet potatoes and taro, as this is better for their digestive system.
This traces back to the famous Dr. Chen from the Song dynasty (960–1279 AD), who
encouraged elderly people to eat foods that are warm, cooked and soft, and to avoid
foods that are glutinous, hardened, raw or cold, because elderly people have weaker
Blood and essence, and their digestive system function decreases.


-----

17 Diet According to Traditional Chinese Medicine … 343

Many healthy longevity people that I interviewed, believe that people over 90
should always eat a highly digestible, low fat, low calorie, low sugar, vitamin rich
diet with plenty of dietary fiber, and eat more vegetable oil. They should avoid eating
a lot of greasy or fatty food, and only occasionally eat deep-fried, preserved, and
overly spicy, salty, or sweet foods. They should also eat 20 percent less and chew
their food well before swallowing.
Although the above rules apply generally, because women and men have different
body constitutions, their health care can also be different. Since women have changes
such as menstruation, pregnancy and post-partum in their life (Zhang 1990), they
often need special foods to provide balance. For instance, Chinese angelica is used
much more for women. As for men, they have prostate glands and different reproductive structures than women, and they produce sperm and have regular ejaculation.
Chinese chive seed is used mostly for men in regulating these functions.
###### ***17.4.2 Considering Season and Locality***

It is important to match one’s diet to the season and personal nature. In the broadest
terms, this involves eating Yang foods to warm and energize the body during the
winter, then eating calming Yin foods to cool the body and reduce heat in the summer.
Be sure to select seasonal produce to get the most nutrients and health benefits.
For instance, some fruits that are seasonal in the summer can assist with cooling the
body. Due to globalization and technological advancements in agriculture, some food
items formerly available only during the summer may now be purchased year-round.
However, this disrupts the natural way and is not conducive to promoting health.
Moreover, people should keep their local environment in mind. If one lives in an area
that is hot and humid, they need to focus on consuming foods that can help reduce
water retention and cool.

Human physical and emotional status is greatly influenced by climate and the
environment, its rhythm and seasons. When applying foods to assist human health,
one should eat less cold food in the winter, less hot food in the summer, less spicy
and pungent food in the autumn dry season and less heavy and oily food in humid
environments.

Geographical features of a place have a strong impact on both body constitution
and food choices. People from the north can take more hot food than people who
have grown up in the south. People from humid regions can tolerate wet climates
better than people from dry regions.
In order to get the best quality of ingredients one should select foods that are
still produced in the area from which they traditionally originate. For instance, the
best quality wolfberries come from Ningxia and Gansu provinces in China. The best
jujubes (red dates) are from Hebei and Shandong province.
However, this theory is just a general guidance, and when people become ill
(or unbalanced), certain routine foods must not be eaten or eaten less quantity while
eatingalternativesortsoffooduntiltheyrecoverfromimbalance.Generallyspeaking,


-----

344 Y. Zhang

warm and hot therapeutic foods, such as ginger, fennel, jujube and walnut have the
function of warming the interior, dispelling cold and assisting Yang, and can be
used to harmonize cold constitutions, treat cold and Yin syndromes (weakness and
dampness). The cool and cold nature of therapeutic foods, such as mung beans,
watermelon, pear and chrysanthemum, have the function of clearing heat, purging
fire, cooling blood and detoxifying, and can be used to harmonize hot constitutions,
and treat heat and Yang syndromes (excess and hot-dryness).
###### ***17.4.3 Avoiding Certain Foods***

Some foods can be harmful or cause illness. In some people or under certain conditions, foods can cause acute or immediate reactions and problems. Examples include
allergies, food poisoning, symptoms related to lactose intolerance, etc. Timing and
amount of food consumption can also negatively impact the digestive system, such
as prolonged hunger or long periods between meals, or eating and drinking too much
at one meal (Zhang et al. 1990). Over-eating one type of food also has a negative
effect. An example is a person who exercises regularly and eats healthy in every
way, including a heavily vegetable-based diet, except eats a large quantity of dark
chocolate every day and then later diagnosed with high cholesterol. Over the longterm, food consumption can even help in negating inherited disorders. The Chinese
saying “illness comes from mouth” (bingcongkouru 病从口入) is still true for many
diseases.Heartdiseases,afattyliver,highbloodpressure,highcholesterolandweight
gain very much have to do with our food intake. If we can reduce certain foods in
the early stages of those illnesses, we can really take control of the condition and
eventually return to a healthy state.
Another way that food can harm is when people eat foods that don’t agree with
their body. As we know, TCM believes that individual bodies may be more inclined
to “hot” or “cold” constitutions. Those who are on the hot side may experience more
constipation, heartburn or mouth ulcers. If this is the case, they should avoid foods
that raise the heat in the body, such as spicy foods, coffee or hot soups. By contrast,
people who are in the cold spectrum may have an upset stomach from drinking too
many cold drinks, eating cold natured food like persimmon, eating ice cream, and
so on, and therefore should avoid raw foods or other cold foods that make them feel
ill, even if they enjoy the flavor.
To avoid excess in eating certain types of foods, one should be mindful of flavor
preference or aversion. Continually eating from only one flavor group can negatively
impact various organs. For example, eating only spicy foods can make you sweat
too much and reduce water content in the body, making the lung body fluid dry out,
it also scatters Qi, people should avoid spicy foods when suffering Qi weakness.
Likewise, too much salt can negatively impact the kidney as they struggle to filter
properly. People who eat too many sweet things, such as cookies or anything with
added sugar, will often face problems with their pancreas from over stimulation, too
much insulin production and may cause muscle weakness and put on weight.

Undigested food becoming stagnant in the digestive tract can lead to chronic
ailments. This may happen if food is not digested thoroughly the first time, if it is not
passed in a timely manner, or if particles become stuck in the intestines. Signs that
food has accumulated in the digestive tract may include poor appetite, belching or
gas with a distinct smell, bloating or diarrhea, and in severe cases, painful heartburn
with a bitter taste in the throat and mouth. When not resolved, gastritis, irritable
bowel syndrome (IBS), pancreatitis and gallstones are likely to occur; polyps can
also develop in the colon, leading to colon cancer.
###### **17.5 Diet for Boosting Healthy Life and Longevity**

Following the discussion about the TCM concepts and theory in Sects. 17.1, 17.2
and 17.3, this section provides some recommendations for memories, immunity and
longevity by introducing some diet and recipes.
Foods and herbs have specific therapeutic actions beyond their temperature, taste,
and the meridians traveled. Food may either strengthen a particular substance or function (Qi, Blood, Yin and Yang), or reduce and regulate the influence of a pathological
condition (Qi or Blood stagnation, dampness, heat or cold). Lychee, for example,
reduces cold and regulates Blood circulation and therefore can treat pigmentation on
the face; kidney beans can enhance Yang.
Chinese herbal diet (yaoshan) refers to a diet remedy made up of foods and herbs
with therapeutic effects. Specifically, the herbal diet recipes can be either in the form
of original food, or processed and mixed from food and herbal materials (Zhang et al.
1993). According to the form and processing method of recipes, a herbal diet can
be divided into the following two categories. Type1 is liquid form, such as juice or
smoothies obtained from freshly squeezed food. It can also be porridge, tea, soup
and paste formed by boiling, and steam. Type 2 is solid form, such as pancake and
steamed bread.

There are two principles that dictate how to pair foods and herbs. One focuses on
matching two foods that have a similar function of Yin or Yang. These form natural
and regular pairings, just like the way you might pair red meat with red wine. In TCM,
an example would be ginger with brown sugar, or silver fungus with honey or crystal
sugar. The second principle is to pair foods that have differing but complimentary
effects on the body. This may involve tonifying/strengthening Qi or Blood through
Yin and Yang properties for the most effective balance. For example, taking ginger
(which strengthens Yang) and dates (to tonify Blood) works to strengthen the body
overall.

###### ***17.5.1 Maintaining Brain Function During Aging***

Aging is an unavoidable phenomenon. It is characterized by both internal and external
changes. On the physical side, there is a decline in physical ability, weakening of the
function of the sense organs, and onset of disorders like cardiac problems, diabetes,
and blood pressure changes. There are also changes mentally, there may be memory
loss or a decrease in mental and logical sharpness.
It is impossible to stay young forever. However, by regulating eating and lifestyle,
one can maintain optimal health. Changing diet cannot only extend life, but it also
will make one feel and look younger than their actual age. Both physical and mental
body could improve through foods and diet. Strengthening Qi, Yang and nourishing
Blood can keep one young mentally, maintaining concentration and a sharp mind.
Toward this end, one could often take ginseng, astragalus root, walnuts, pistachios,
chestnuts, raspberries, cassia fruits, black sesame seeds, cherries, angelica root,
coconuts, cinnamon powder, gingko nuts, rosemary, saffron crocus, pumpkin seeds,
wolfberries, longan fruit, schisandra berries and pu’er tea. ***17.5.2 Regulating and Boosting Immunity***

If the immune system is depressed or overly sensitive, it becomes prone to numerous
diseases, ranging from the common cold to cancer. The onset of respiratory infection
tends to be higher when combined with a sensitive or weakened immune system; in
the long-term this can lead to auto-immune and allergy-originating diseases. TCM
believes that the lung, the spleen and the kidney Qi is our body’s defense, preventing
illness from invading deep into body. To strengthen the Qi, and ultimately overall
immunity, one should eat healthy foods, and make simple dietary changes to balance
all the functions. In doing so, we can prevent some respiratory illnesses and the
onset of allergies. Toward this end, one could often take ginseng, astragalus root, fig,
ginger, licorice, garlic, jujubes, lotus seeds, marine algae, sea buckthorn, silver ear,
onion, lingzhi (reishi) and shiitake mushroom, and five leaf gynostemma herb. ***17.5.3 Achieving Healthy Longevity***

Throughout China’s history, the combination of health foods and diet therapy has
been used to achieve the goal of healthy longevity. According to my interviews with
more than 80 elderly people over the age of 70, and reviewing more than 2000 of
my own clinical documents, in addition to some literature. I have a concluded that
food ingredients and diet patterns are closely related to health and longevity, which is
reflected in two aspects of health preservation and outcome of my clinical treatments.

**17.5.3.1** **Diet Therapy for Illness Prevention**

Through the proper choice of foods and herbs one can live a balanced, healthy life,
and avoid illness. This highlights the preventative side of TCM, which should be
appealing to all: An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure!
In southern China, most people start to pay attention to health preservation and
choose special diet in their 40 to 50s. People in this age group clearly feel a certain
level of body and mental functions deterioration, and often have disorders in their
nutrient absorption and organ functions. This health transition will affect people’s
work performance, and ultimately their quality of life. In the past one can eat
whichever food he prefers, of any quantity at any time of day, or likewise consume
only one meal per day, or even fast for three to five days. Once one has reached middle
age, one would feel dizzy, sweaty and unable to work if one skips a meal; drinking
alcohol would cause a headache and heart palpitations; and eating spicy food may
lead to a stomachache and diarrhea. Some people seek the advice of TCM doctor,
to identify their body constitutions, and the functional status of the digestive system
and to get recommendations for suitable food and diets. Their bodily functions may
restore to normal in a few months after taking professional advices and a food remedies. Some of them get even more benefits after taking systematic measures, for
instance, eating small portion of meals up to four or five times each day (applicable
to people with weak spleen and stomach), eating cold food only in warm weather
(for people with cold constitution, choose cooked food, warm food in winter), and
following the seasonal changes to adjust diets. Undertaking such methods for several
years, people could reduce the incidence of respiratory and digestive system illness.
Other common symptoms are hot flashes, sweating, insomnia and losing temper
easily in the age group between 50 and 60s, which is a result of declining human
hormone levels. However, if people maintain a healthy diet these symptoms can be
reduced or disappear, therefore benefit the quality of life for advance age.
For those who would like to apply food therapy before reaching the middle age,
they could think of the two aspects presented below.
(1) Methods of healthcare and prevention based on previous medical experience
and weaknesses.

From people’s history of illness, doctors can detect the varied weakness in each
patient. For example, when contracting a cold or flu, the disease may affect the nose
and sinuses in one patient, but affect the stomach and appetite in another. If cold
always affects one’s nose and sinuses, their lung Qi needs to be strengthened. If
a patient does not suffer from colds frequently, their condition is normal; but if a
patient catches cold 4 to 5 times a year or chronically, they must pay attention to it.
To strengthen lung and prevent illness, people can eat almonds, pears, lotus roots, or
lotus seeds.

If cold or stress always affects one’s stomach, causing symptoms such as stomachache, bloating, and diarrhea, the stomach and spleen function needs to be strengthened. Patients can eat ginger, whole grains such as glutinous rice, buckwheat, congee,
or oats, root vegetables such as yams, or beans like lentils.
(2) Methods of healthcare and prevention based on family history.


-----

348 Y. Zhang

If patient has a family history of a certain condition, one can take measures
to prevent the same condition occurring in his or her lifetime. Family history is
a good indicator of potential health issues, so people should look to their parents
and grandparents (or even immediate relatives) to identify potential weak areas. If
a patient has a family history of joint problems, such as the hip or toe joints, or
the development of osteoporosis (during menopause), they must tonify the kidney
system. Some preventative methods for joint problems are delaying menopause by
tonifying the kidney and related organ systems with food (starting from the age of
around 42 or 45). For example, one can eat more chestnuts, mulberry, hazel, sour
jujube, and drink herbal wine from time to time. If patient has a family history
of allergic rhinitis and asthma, they must tonify the lung system and related organ
systems with food. For example, one can eat more fresh and dried ginger, almonds,
juicy pear and gingko nut to maintain a good function of the lung.
Regulating the diet, especially using tonics in autumn and winter, is one of the
dietary traditions in China, through by which people can cope with winter cold
and emergencies as well as maintain health. Those who take tonics in autumn and
winter can also prevent common diseases, such as by enhancing the lung and kidney
respiratory functions, support heart function, and optimize health of the individual
to prevent flu, bronchitis, asthma and arrhythmia.
Enhancing spleen (stomach) and kidney system are most effective for healthy
longevity. The classic works of Yellow Emperor’s Canon of Medicine holds that the
key factor in the internal causes of human aging is the degeneration of vitality in the
kidney system. If one can maintain the function and adjust the balance of Yin and
Yang in the kidney system, will be effective in delaying aging.
The kidney system (a broad TCM definition including development, spine,
marrow, bladder) is the administrative organ with the greatest power. The kidney
system is the congenital base of life and stores essence. The kidney system acts as
the strength and intelligence of the entire body, and is responsible for its overall body
constitution. It is a storage facility for good essence, and it governs the growth and
development of the body as well as the maturation of the reproductive systems. It
is the congenital base of life, roots of Yin–Yang energy, and grows partly based on
heritage. People’s health management influence the kidney’s overall status (Zhang
2010).
The kidney system of TCM is related to modern medicine functions including
reproduction endocrine, bones, brain, and spinal nerves, etc. If someone regulates
the function of the kidney system, can maintain concentration and a good memory, it
would be beneficial to the quality of sleeping, healthy bones and hearing, and prevent
early Alzheimer’s disease and renal hypertension.
In TCM, the spleen system and stomach system are the roots of the acquired
constitution, the source of Qi and Blood. The digestive system, represented by the
spleen and stomach includes the function of the pancreas of modern medicine, which
is relatedtoendocrine, nutritional andmetabolicdiseases withhighclinical morbidity
and mortality, such as diabetes, fatty liver, and obesity.
Once people reach middle age, they start to feel that skipping breakfast or eating
too fast affects their physical and mental condition throughout the day. Generally,


-----

17 Diet According to Traditional Chinese Medicine … 349

breakfast should be rich in variety and nutritious, as the entire day’s store of Yang
energy and one’s mental energy is dependent on the various nutrients absorbed in
the morning. Lunch should also include sufficient nutritious food, since it maintains
people’s energy in the afternoon and evening. Dinner may be simple, since eating
foods that are hard to digest or overeating can affect sleep.
Research on intestinal microbes in recent years has revealed that the balance status
of intestinal flora will influence the central nervous system, reproductive system,
endocrine and nutrient metabolism (people’s tolerance of food, waste excretion).
Thesestudieshaveshownthathumanbehaviors,emotions,personalitycharacteristics
and cognitive abilities are not only regulated by the brain, but also affected by the
gut-brain axis; not only by their brain nerves, but also by intestinal microbes. Human
pain perception and pain responses, emotions, and cognitive abilities are closely
related to intestinal microbes (Collen 2015). TCM believes that the structure and
function of the intestine are related to the major systems of the spleen, the liver and
the kidney. In other words, whether the microbes are balanced depends on whether
people can correctly choose healthy food to prevent food poisoning. The five organ
systems defined by TCM also have effects on the digestive function of synergy.
Appetite is one of the key signs of human health. The quality of appetite is not
only related to the activities of the digestive system, but also to people’s overall physiological function. Many diseases can cause changes in appetite. Actually abnormal
appetite is the first symptom of the disease in clinic. Doctors often say that those
patients who have a good appetite should recover easily from illness. Another sign
of status of normal digestion is bowel movement conditions. For middle-aged and
elderly people, a slightly soft stool is better than constipation. People with constipation, such as excessive force during defecation, may induce heart disease. To
treat constipation with diet therapies would work. Healthy people can eat vegetables that are more cruciferous. Those with conditions of less teeth, weak spleen
energy and stomach dysfunction, can choose root vegetables with short and soft
fibers, such as yam, sweet potato, potato, taro, etc. The methods of cooking could
be steaming, making soup; cutting vegetables into small pieces to mix with rice, a
pancake or a smoothie with turnips, greens, beans, celery vegetables. TCM doctors
often recommend that patients with constipation should have hemp seeds, almonds,
honey, sesame seeds, and pine nuts.

**17.5.3.2** **Diet Therapy for Treating Serious Diseases**

This section introduces some methods and principles for diet therapy using the
example of the top four mortality rates in Shanghai, namely cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, tumors, respiratory diseases, endocrine nutrition and metabolic
diseases. Many people suffer from hypertension, hyperlipidemia, heart and brain
ischemia, tumors, allergic asthma, insulin resistance, diabetes before they pay attention to health diet. At this stage, TCM doctors prescribe foods and herbs according
to the severity of diseases. In the acute stage, doctors diagnose the type of disease
and work out the best treatments as soon as possible, supplemented by food therapy.


-----

350 Y. Zhang

Patients in recovery stage can accelerate the pace if they can apply both medical
treatments and food therapy. For some patients who have to take long-term or lifetime medication such as type 1 and type 2 diabetes, they can introduce diet and
herbs as a complimentary remedy to slow the progression of the disease and prevent
complications. In the early stage of hypertension without family history, patients can
try to replace some medicines with foods and herbs, and postpone the time required
for chemical intervention.

**17.5.3.3** **Diet Therapy for Treating Common Diseases**

There are six groups of commonly used foods and herbs of which can protect one
from sickness and prolong life. Doctors can apply their functions based on the TCM
perspective. The following six categories of foods are classified according to the food
property of neutral, cool and warm. Neutral foods are moderate and can be taken
daily or weekly for everyone. Cool effect foods are applied to balance hot condition,
and warm effect foods to cold condition. (Table 17.1).

(1) Nuts and Seeds
Nuts and seeds are the essence of plants, providing abundant antioxidants and
anti-inflammatory elements to people because they are rich in nutrients and
contain large amounts of protein, trace elements, and vitamins.
Peanuts are prominent longevity food. Chinese medicine proposes that most
nuts and seeds are neutral or warm in temperature. They supply Qi and Blood,
strengthen Yin and Yang, moisturize the skin, quench thirst, moisten dryness,
remove annoyance, relieve asthma, and reverse Qi reflux. This food remedy is
suitable for one who shows signs of has an early onset of aging, and night and
frequent urination, fatigue, dizzy spells, dry throat and mouth, dry cough, dry
or peeling skin, dry itching, constipation and other similar symptoms.
Those patients who have symptoms of excessive phlegm and congestions, who
easily feel hot and sweaty or who are Yin-Yang balanced should eat less nuts
and seeds or eat cautiously.
Since most nuts and seeds contain a higher portion of fat, high oil content, easily
oxidable, people eat too much of nuts leading to weight gain. It is advisable to
consume moderate amounts of nuts and seeds, preferably 20 to 30 g per day.
(2) Fruits
Fruits are rich in beta-carotene and vitamin c, the key antioxidants that help
people absorb special enzymes, reduce blood cholesterol levels, and lower the
risk of hypertension.
However, fruits are high in sugar and acid. People should not take them as staple
foods. Fruits with higher medicinal value can be used both as food and herbs,
likewise lemon, cranberries, apples, mulberries, raspberries, pomegranate,
schisandra berries, longan fruit, hawthorn, wolfberries, and fresh jujube. Many
fruits are often used in their dried form such as lemon, mulberries, raspberries,
schisandra berries, longan fruit, hawthorn, wolfberries and jujube. Fruits can

increase organ functions, stabilize emotions, regulate Yin and Yang, tonify Qi,
and nourish the Blood. Those patients who experience dizziness, infertility,
early onset of aging, and night and frequent urination can choose the fruit
family. They eat the raw and fresh fruits in harvest or in the warm season and
the cooked or dried fruits in the other seasons or in cold weather. When their

digestive functions are back to normal, patients can eat raw and fresh fruits;
while the function weak, eat cooked or dried fruits.
The phrase “an apple a day keeps the doctor away” is a folk proverb that
emphasizes the apple’s comprehensive conditioning and capabilities of health
care. Eating apples on a regular basis not only increases nutrition of the heart
and the lung by cooling their heat, but also has a positive impact on aiding
digestion. Because apples have both strengthening and regulating functions,
they nourish body fluids and remove summer heat, and help relieve restlessness, thirst and irritability. As apples benefit the stomach, they help drinkers
sober up from alcohol. Apples have been used to treat lack of appetite, dry
mouth, poor digestion, diarrhea and bloating in the abdomen after overeating
or overdrinking alcohol.
(3) Allium
Allium plants are also taken as vegetables and condiments, and are particularly
effective for the balance of probiotics in the body. Garlic, chives, spring onion,
onions, and coriander (cilantro) all contain dietary fibers and organosulfur
compounds, can kill viruses and therefore limit fungal infection.
TCM thinks that allium plants are warm in nature and spicy in taste, and can
stimulate the body’s Qi, Blood, and Yang, increase functions of the kidney, the
liver, the heart, the lung and the digestive system, help body Qi movement and
Blood circulation, and open the pores and nasal orifices. Spring onion, garlic
green chives are commonly eaten daily.
Spring onion has the function of improving immunity on the body surface and
regulates the opening and closing of sweat pores. Spring onion is useful for
treating cold and flu, and inhibiting the onset of water retention above the chest,
as well as relieving cold abdominal pain. This plant also has the function of
detoxifying. Spring onion removes irritants from mosquito bites, and prevents
constipation and reduced urine. Doctors also apply spring onion to treat light
symptom of dysentery and acne.
Garlic warms the digestive system and moves body Qi. It treats food retention,
cold sensations pain in the abdomen, and diarrhea. Garlic detoxifies, kills parasites, and inhibits the flu virus, tuberculosis, dysentery and vaginal discharge.
It also helps reduce swelling and edema. Garlic juice can be applied topically
on the affected area to treat fungal infection of hands, and itchiness, due to
athlete’s foot. We can eat raw or cooked garlic. Garlic leaves and garlic oil are
alternatives for those who dislike garlic.
Chinese medicine suggests that onions have the effects of strengthening the
stomach and regulating the movement of Qi, detoxifying insect bites, and
killing insects. It is commonly used for treating hyperlipidemia, poor appetite,
abdominal bloating, trauma ulcers, and trichomonas vaginitis in China.

Green chives (garlic chives) warm and tonify the liver and the kidney, reinforce
Yang energy, strengthen the stomach, enliven circulation, and dissipate Blood
stasis. Doctors apply green chives to treat menstrual and discharge problems,
sorebackandknees,incontinenceorpolyuriacausedbykidneyYangweakness.
(4) Bean products, bean sprouts and fermented food
Beans are rich in protein, fiber, and carbohydrates while being very low in
fat and sugar, they are warehouses of nutrients needed by the human body
(Mitchell 2009). This includes yellow, black, green soybeans, black beans,
azuki, mung beans, sword beans, and peas.
Soybeans and soymilk have the function of strengthening the digestive system
and moistening dryness. They are more useful for treating chronic and weak
cough, chronic diarrhea, etc. Soymilk can promote weight gain in people who
are too thin by improving their digestion. People who have arthritis and joint
pain may have some relief by eating proper dosage of soy products. Since tofu
containsgypsum,theenergyoftofu(asdefinedbyTCM)iscoolerthansoymilk.
Therefore, tofu can be used to treat acute eye infection or the lung infection
(asthma and cough with green yellow mucus). Tofu will ameliorate conditions
of people who have stomach heat alongside bad breath. Black soybeans have a
function of strengthening the digestive system and kidney Yin, helping Blood
circulation, reducing toxins and water retention.
Those who do not like beans or cannot consume many beans because of health
conditions can eat more fermented foods like sauerkraut, miso soup, kimchi,
yogurt, natto, dried black bean sauce and vinegar. The beneficial bacteria inside
fermented foods can improve immunity, dispel the onset of the flu, inhibit
chronic inflammation, support the digestive system, help Blood circulation,
ease discomfort in the chest, and relieve palpitations. Natto kinase and vinegar
may also soften Blood vessels and dissolve thrombi.
Sprouts contain high levels of concentrated enzymes that make them easier to
digest than that of mature beans. Bean sprouts (soybean and mung bean) are
used to treat common warts, reduce heat to resolve early stage of urinary tract
infection and relieve alcohol hangover.
The active ingredients in tea (green, black, or pu’er), tea polyphenols, are
antioxidant substances. Those residents who consume tea often have lower

risk of cancer, indicating that tea polyphenols can eliminate free radicals and
therefore prevent cancer.
Some doctors recommend Pu’er tea for taking care of digestive health, especially for people with weight issues or difficulty with digesting mixed protein
foods. If there is an infection in the colon, with diarrhea and abdominal pain,
Pu’er tea can help by reducing the degree of pain and stopping diarrhea. It can
helpproducethelininginsideofthedigestivetracktoprotectexcessacidity,and
such acidity causes ulcers and bacterial imbalances that can result in infection.
When people drink excess alcohol and experience a hangover or liver discomfort, Pu’er tea can help reduce the symptoms and eliminate the liver toxins.
It can also help improve the symptoms of indigestion, heavy bloating, and
refresh the body and breath. People can use this tea as a mouthwash to eliminate


-----

354 Y. Zhang

bleeding and soreness of the teeth and gums. Pu’er tea can help the movement
of Qi and body fluid, especially in the lung and spleen systems. Drinking it for
long period can reduce blood lipids and blood cholesterol, help stabilize blood
pressure and prevent artery hardening because it expel mucous and phlegm
from inside of organs and Blood vessels. Pu’er cools heat and nourish body
fluids, expels summer heat, quenches thirst, and treats constipation and facial
pimples (Zhang 2021).
Green tea clears the eyes and head, and aids concentration and alertness. Green
tea is a good alternative to coffee for caffeine to aid waking and generate early
morning energy. Specifically, early morning tiredness may be caused by blockages in energy flow, which green tea helps to eliminate. It is known to reduce
hot feelings in the body manifested as dizziness, thirst and irritability and
refreshing the body. Some people, primarily those who have a hot constitution,
can use green tea to increase urination, as it helps low output of urine and
edema.

(5) Whole Grains
Grains, here mainly rice and cereals, include glutinous rice, wheat, barley, oats,
rye, corn, millet, and buckwheat. Grains contain a large amount of soluble and
insoluble fibers, B vitamins, and proteins. With mild taste, grains are digestible
and absorbable, and an indispensable source of essential nutrients for children
and the elderly. Grains can strengthen the spleen and stomach systems. Since
propertiesofgrainsaremultifold,includingneutral,cool,orwarm,theyprovide
easy choices for individuals and eating in various seasons. For instance, oats
and glutinous rice are warm in temperature, so people can have more in the
winter.

Oats are rich in protein, calcium, riboflavin, and thiamine, and they are the best
cereals of antioxidant food. Daily intake of oats can strengthen the spleen and
stomach system, tonifying Qi and Blood.
Buckwheat contains more protein than oat and wheatgrains (Mitchell 2009).
Its taste is sweet and its energy is cool. It is used to clear away heat, dampness
and toxin, and help in the recovery of people’s intestinal function. Both internal
and external usage can stop yellow color sweating, treat dysentery, erysipelas
and furuncle of heat. The leaves and branch of buckwheat have a function to

strengthen the vascular system and prevent bleeding.
Millet is easy to digest, and hence plays a role in benefiting the spleen and
stomach system for elderly people who suffer from stomach ailments. Its taste
is sweet and its energy cool. If people make millet into form of porridge, there
appears a layer of delicate sticky substance on top, commonly known as rice
oil. Chinese medicine considers that rice oil is extremely rich in nutrients and
has the strongest nourishing power. They even claim that “rice oil can substitute
for ginseng soup”.
Sweet potato’s properties are neutral in energy and taste sweet, and its function
is related to the kidney, the spleen systems. Sweet potatoes strengthen the
spleen and stomach system by creating energy, smoothing bowel movement,


-----

17 Diet According to Traditional Chinese Medicine … 355

and therefore doctors use it to treat burning sensations in the stomach and
esophagus, constipation, bloody stool and diarrhea.
(6) Algae food and cruciferous vegetables.
Seaweed are spore plants, including Marine algae, kelp, nori, and wakame, etc.
Seaweed contains high amounts of minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium,
iodine, phytonutrients lignans, B vitamin folate (Mitchell 2009) etc. Seaweed
properties are cold, taste are bitter and salty, it enters the liver, stomach and
kidney systems. Marine algae and kelp are noted for the ability to dispel phlegm
and soften lumps. Patients who have an enlarged thyroid or have lumps, or
muscular nodules can use marine algae as a remedy. Middle age or elderly
patients whose immune system are weak, warts are more likely to grow, or
hernias to develop. Doctors can use marine algae and kelp to treat. Topically
use of marine algae can reduce pigmentation, wrinkles and under-eye bags.
Cruciferous vegetables are common vegetables, and including bok choy,
Chinese cabbage, mustard, cabbage, shepherd’s purse and radish.
Many herbs belong to this category, such as white mustard seeds and radish
seeds. Its medical function is prevention of cancer. In Chinese herbal medicine,
radish seeds are neutral in temperature, and sweet and spicy in taste. White
mustard seeds are hot in temperature, and spicy in taste. Both of them can
be used to regulate Qi, and Blood and expel Phlegm. They can adjust the
metabolism of Qi, Blood, and the body fluids. Doctors use them to treat
indigestion, fullness of the abdomen, dysuria, constipation, and edema.
Shepherd’s purse has function of adjustment of digestive, reproductive system.
Its medical usage is to stop hemorrhages, treat vomiting blood, blood in the
stool, heavy menstruation, prolonged lochiorrhea, and so on.
###### **17.6 Conclusion**

Chinese medical philosophy of Yin-Yang and Five Elements provides unique guidance on understanding of food property and body constitutions. Human health is
closely related to natural environment particularly through everyone’s diet.
The theory of diet therapy in TCM believes that people should apply food property
to balance Yin-Yang, and maintain health. Because people have different constitutions, such as age, gender, health status, and live in varied seasons and geographic
location, they need to create a justified and tailored diet.
Enhancing the spleen (stomach) and kidney system are most effective way for
health and longevity. Recent research in the literature on the gut-brain axis has
revealed that human body and spiritual health influenced by the digestive system,
particularly intestinal microbes. Therefore, food therapy is very effective and need
to be further development from mixed disciplines.

##### **Chapter 18**
#### **Indian Traditional Foods and Diets:** **Combining Traditional Wisdom** **with Modern Science of Nutraceuticals** **and Functional Foods**

**Jyoti S. Gokhale, S. S. Lele, and Laxmi Ananthanarayan**

**Abstract** Indian traditional foods emphasize not only on providing the energy needs
of the body but also aim to improve the overall health and prevent diseases in
the Indian population. Indian traditional diets which are predominantly vegetarian
majorly comprise of whole grains, pulses, nuts, vegetables, fruits, spices, herbs, dairy
products, and fermented foods which themselves can be considered as ‘functional’
being high in a variety of phytochemicals with nutraceutical potential. India, being a
diverse country with various cultures, languages, climates, religion, and communities, exemplifies great variety in cuisines and their preparation methods. Along with
their intrinsic nutritive nature, the traditional foods also enrich the diet with different
bioactive compounds. Many factors have resulted in transition in the dietary habits of
the Indian population especially in metropolitan cities going away from traditional
dietary practices with direct impact on the health of the people. Therefore, a revival
in the eating of traditional diets based on appreciation of their health beneficial properties backed by scientific studies is necessary. Indian tradition also considers foods
with functional ingredients to be consumed during various stages of life depending
on the physiological needs. The major classes of bioactives/phytochemicals present
in the Indian traditional foods along with their health benefits have been included
and examples of traditional Indian foods with potential as functional foods have been
specified. This awareness of traditional wisdom behind healthful properties of traditional foods has opened up many new avenues for scientific investigations which can
lead to validation and proper documentation of the claims made.

###### **18.1 Introduction**

India is known for diversity in terms of language, food, clothing and fine arts like
music and dance as well. At present there are 29 states, 8 union territories and a
population over 1.39 billion eating nearly 5 billion meals a day. Traditional Indian
food preparations are influenced by availability of raw materials and climate. People
of the northern states of India are generally wheat eaters whereas, people belonging
to the southern parts daily consume rice as staple food. Across India pulses (whole
and split), lentils, millets and sprouts are consumed regularly, although some of the
ingredients used and method of preparation are quite different in various regions.
Since India ranks second in the world in fruit and vegetable production, Indian
traditional diets predominantly include plant sources. Although a significant fraction
of the population consume fish, meat, eggs, poultry, and other non-vegetarian foods,
rarely does anyone follow an exclusively non-vegetarian diet. This is perhaps due to
limitations in the availability of fish and meat and sometimes due to high cost of these
items. Further there are restrictions on consumption of such products due to religious
beliefs and traditions. Interestingly, milk although scientifically a commodity of
animal origin, is considered as “vegetarian” not just by tradition but also by the
Indian Food Law. Perhaps India is the only country in the world where a processed
food of animal origin has a red dot and vegetarian food has a green dot used as a
symbol on the package, but milk is a “green dot” product!
The combined effect of these factors is that Indians have been consuming lots of
fruits and vegetables, drinking water as the main beverage and consuming milk and
dairy products in their regular diet. Another interesting fact is regular consumption
of yoghurt-like fermented milk product, called *dahi* . Even today, in most rural parts
of India, *dahi* is made in every household and consumed daily during meals. Some
prefer to consume it in the form of *chhas* or *lassi* which are beverage forms made
from *dahi* . This probiotic food product is rich in *lactobacilli* and forms part of daily
diet across India in all states typically consumed during meals. Survivability of the
probiotic culture in acidic pH of the stomach and further in conditions prevailing in
the gut to reach the colon in an active form is probably aided by consuming these
cultures as part of a meal. Most of the Indian festivals and religious rituals are linked
with the season and there are traditions which recommend a specific food and diet
to mark the celebration. Just to cite one example, in January when the Sun enters
Capricorn zodiac, it is celebrated as *Makar Sankranti* festival. This day marks the end
of winter solstice during mid-winter period in India and is celebrated by different
names across India, but the commonality is that all the states have a tradition of
consuming lot of sesame seeds and jaggery in various formats. For example, ‘ *tilgul* ’
a popular traditional confection of Maharashtra which is sentimentally exchanged
by one another during *Makar Sankranti* festival is made from sesame seeds and
jaggery which gives a good supply of energy from sugar and oil and are suitable for
the winter season. Thus, Indian traditions nurture both values and good habits for
healthy living.

Indian people also follow the dietary recommendations proposed by Ayurveda.
The literal meaning of Ayurveda is “knowledge of life”. There are three main books
in Ayurveda written by the great authors *Charak*, *Sushrut*, and *Vagbhat* (Anonymous
2021). In addition, there are few more documents written over the centuries. All this
literature is in Sanskrit language, mostly in poetic form for ease of memorization. The
first and largest book is by *Charak* which focuses on “fire of digestion”. It is a collection of knowledge accrued over thousands of years. Ayurveda describes diagnostic
methods, botanical extracts in various forms to be used as medicine, body cleansing
methods, surgery, and many other aspects. Ayurveda is not just alternate medicine,
but it also talks of personalized food based on constitution of each individual, food
based on climate, food for patients with specific ailment and food for different age
groups. Main thrust of Ayurveda is on preventing diseases and maintaining health by
balancing diet with lifestyle and personal constitution (Lad 2017). In fact, Ayurveda
has also described correct way of cooking food so as to get maximum benefits (Lad
and Lad 2010). This suggests that although the term nutraceutical is recently coined
ancient Indian traditions had similar concept of food being used as medicine!
The term nutraceutical was coined by Stephen DeFelice, founder, and chairman
of the Foundation for Innovation in Medicine (FIM), in 1989 from “nutrition” and
“pharmaceuticals” (Kalra 2003). According to DeFelice, nutraceutical can be defined
as, ‘a food (or part of a food) that provides medical or health benefits, including the
prevention and/or treatment of a disease’. The health benefits of functional foods
are mainly because of the bioactive compounds such as phytochemicals, vitamins,
peptides, found naturally in them, or extracted from other sources and added into
them, whereas nutraceuticals are themselves concentrated forms of the bioactive
substances which show disease preventive or curative effect. The terms ‘bioactive’
or ‘functional ingredient’ are used to represent a substance with significant biological
activity having a positive impact on health. Other terms, such as phytochemicals or
phytoconstituents, represent natural chemical entities of plant origin. Nutraceuticals
are provided in pharmaceutical form whereas functional foods are given in food
matrix. One of the important prerequisites, both in nutraceuticals and functional
foods, is that they should provide the functional ingredient in sufficient quantity to
prevent or cure a disease. In general, there is no need for doctor’s recommendation
for taking functional foods and they can be a part of our daily diet, whereas it
is advisable to consult a doctor before taking any nutraceutical preparation. For
example, if anyone wants to consume probiotic curd in their daily diet, they need
not take it under medical supervision but if an individual wants to take Vitamin D
supplement, it is preferable to be taken under doctor’s advice.
In the last few decades, transformation in the food habits, reduced physical work,
and more sedentary jobs have led to many lifestyle-associated diseases such as
diabetes, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension to name some. Nowadays,
malnutrition is not only seen in economically backward people but also in urban
and affluent sections of society due to lack of timely and nutritious foods which
has led to micronutrient deficiencies (Rishi 2020). Deficiencies of calcium, vitamin
B12, vitamin D, iodine are very commonly witnessed in the population which has
increased the importance of nutraceutical and functional food market. Moreover, the


-----

technological advances, sociodemographic profiles, changing agricultural practices,
lifestyle changes especially in metro cities and availability of processed foods has
led to a transition in the dietary habits of people away from traditional eating patterns
to consumption of junk foods and refined foods loaded with empty calories. This has
further strengthened the need for foods with increased health benefits such as fiber
containing nutritious foods having fewer calories, with low glycemic response and
a high satiety value. Thus, these are the major drivers in the growth, current development and production witnessed in the global functional food and nutraceuticals
market. The age-old sayings “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food”
and “Prevention is better than cure” are gaining new perspectives once again in the
minds of consumers nowadays. Thus, nutraceuticals and functional foods are now
looked upon as important items on the monthly expenses list, indispensable from
health viewpoint.
The global nutraceutical market is estimated to reach from $247 billion in 2019 to
$336 billion in 2023 with compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8%. Currently,
USA, Japan, and Europe share 90% part of the global market whereas India’s, global
nutraceutical market share of 2% in 2019 is expected to reach 3.5% by 2023 with
CAGR of 21% and a total estimated valuation of $11 billion (Rishi 2020). Thus,
nutraceuticals and functional foods are set to become essentially accepted and a
regular part in the Indian household in the near future.
The recent outlook on foods which has shifted from merely providing sustainable
life and growth to providing preventive rather curative action against various forms
of diseases has been a conventionally recognized belief in the Indian traditional food
system. Thus, recent recognition of the role of bioactives in the form of nutraceuticals
or the role of functional foods truly aligns with the design of Indian traditional foods.
Indian traditional foods emphasize not only on providing the energy needs of the
body but also aim to improve the overall health and prevent diseases in the Indian
population. The Indian traditional wisdom of food choices can easily be correlated
with the buzz word of modern science such as “nutraceutical” or “functional food”.

Traditional wisdom can help to understand or claim the benefits of different foods, but
thismustbevalidatedbysupportingitwithrobustscientificevidenceandthenmaking
these foods available in consumer acceptable and convenient formats. For example,
*ashwagandha* root which has been prominently advised to be important in improving
strength and vitality is now getting acceptance in sports nutrition. Similar is the case
with *Haldi* milk which is part of a traditional Indian diet and consumed for its health
benefits but is now getting globally accepted as ‘ *turmeric latte* ’. Thus, in both the
examples, it is traditional knowledge which has led to a way of offering the health
benefits in a new format. This chapter gives a bird’s eye view about the traditional
wisdom of the Indian foods which has been in existence for more than 5000 years.
Thus, it is an attempt to educate the reader about the nutritional preeminence of
many Indian traditional foods backed by scientific evidence. It also covers recent
literature about the bioactive substances found in Indian traditional foods which are

predominantlyplantbasedandwhichtodayarebeingacknowledgedasnutraceuticals
or functional foods.

###### **18.2 Indian Traditional Foods**

Traditional foods of any country define the culture of the nation and are closely
linked to the health and wellbeing of the population. They also reflect the agricultural patterns, traditional beliefs with respect to festivals, seasonal variability,
availability, and accessibility to foods along with processing/preparation techniques
followed through ages. The Indian traditional food system includes thousands of
Indian cuisines, region specific foods, based on understanding of what to eat when,
and guided by knowledge of Ayurveda and use of herbs for medicinal benefits which
has existed for centuries. Therefore, Indian traditional wisdom is deeply entrenched
in promoting health. Along with this, Indian cooking also considers cuisines for
different seasons, aptness of the cuisine according to time of the day, pre-existing
health condition and even mood. Existing traditional wisdom behind Indian foods
thusoffersscopeforundertakingproperscientificinvestigationsinordertostrengthen
the health claims associated with them.

Indian traditional diets majorly comprise of whole grains, nuts, pulses, vegetables,
fruits, spices, herbs, milk, dairy products, and fermented foods which themselves
can be considered as “functional” being high in fibers, antioxidants, micronutrients,
probiotics, prebiotics which are the popular choices for health campaigns nowadays
globally. Many Indian traditional foods impart significant physiological health benefits ranging from improving immune system, and gut health, while reducing oxidative
stress, cholesterol, risk of heart diseases, inflammatory diseases and demonstrating
anti-obesity effect. The functional (bioactive) components abundantly available in
Indian traditional foods which positively impacts human health can be in the form
of vitamins, minerals, dietary fibers, lignin, polyphenols, flavonoids, fatty acids,
essential amino acids, peptides, lactic acid bacteria to name some.
Indian diets are rich in plant-based ingredients and constituents with potential
nutraceutical benefits as we understand today. They have existed for centuries even
before knowledge of ‘nutraceuticals’ and ‘functional foods’ was recognized. Thus,
it is necessary for today’s global generation to have knowledge of the heritage of
Indian foods. This chapter mainly focuses on the integration of traditional wisdom
of Indian foods with modern sciences using existing scientific literature as a base.
Hence, the traditional and ethnic foods with their nutritional and health beneficial
aspects unleash a colossal opportunity for many researchers throughout the world
and provide for the possible reach of traditional foods in the health sector through
conduct of sound scientific investigations.
India, being a diverse country with various cultures, languages, climates, religion, and communities, exemplifies great variety in cuisines and their preparation
methods. Predominantly Indian population follows a vegetarian diet though some
regions especially the coastal regions follow a non-vegetarian diet where the availability of fish and other marine foods is abundant. But in India even those who follow
a non-vegetarian diet eat such foods occasionally while a greater part of their diets
includes vegetarian food sources. The Indian diet therefore comprises of a healthful
fusion of many food ingredients of plant and animal origin. Indian traditional foods

which have evolved over a long period of time include staple foods from cereal
based items; accompanying dishes including vegetable and legume/ *dal* preparations,
pickles, chutneys, *papad*, *ghee* or oil as a medium of cooking, foods prepared from
fermented batter, milk and nonmilk-based sweets and various snack items. Table 18.1
enlists some examples of different food items consumed under different meal types
based on specific parts of the country.
In general, the meal patterns in India are comprised of fiber-rich foods such as
*roti*, *chapatti*, fruits and vegetables, protein sources such as legumes/ *dals*, energy
sources such as rice with moderate quantity of vegetable oil/ *ghee* (clarified butter)
used in the preparation, a variety of spices used for flavoring and curds as a source
of probiotic. It can be observed that region wise there are differences in the types
of food consumed and their preparation methods. Rice ( *Oryza sativa* ) consumption
predominates in South India whereas North Indian staple foods are prepared from
wheat ( *Triticum aestivum* ). Millets are preferred by few of the states where these
crops are grown and harvested.
Though the Indian traditional food is a nutritious way of following a healthy
lifestyle, the globalization of food chain, increase in disposable incomes, enormous
increase in number of processed foods available, easy access to fast foods and other
factors have resulted in transition in the dietary habits of the Indian population with
direct impact on the health of the people. Nutritional quality of the diet is decreasing at
an alarming rate which is adversely affecting the health of the population. Thus, there
is an imperative need for educating the consumer about negative impact of changed
dietary habits and the nutritional superiority of many traditional foods supported by
scientific evidence.
###### **18.3 Indian Traditional Foods as Functional Foods**

Nutritionisagloballydynamicareaofscientificinvestigationwhichcommenceswith
history, geography, culture, resources, and genetics and goes till the development of
different food products with their nutritional benefits for the consumer and overall
communities. Internationally, food tradition is playing important role in this type of
research, but it has always been considered as a belief-based tradition without any
scientific evidence about any of the nutritional or health aspects. Recently, the interest
in traditional and ethnic foods has been increasing leading to increase inclaims about
their nutritional and health promoting benefits. Nowadays, the preparation of traditional foods has deviated from the ways it used to be prepared in the earlier times.
In principle, there is a body of knowledge about the traditional food, but it is strewn
globally and some or most of it is in the minds of persons belonging to older generation or in the form of notes maintained by these people. This knowledge about
traditional foods and its benefits may have been reported or published in different
locally published magazines, books, or journals but it would be hard to salvage this
if at all it is retrievable. Thus, much of this knowledge will dissipate if not captured
in time. For a long time, the immense experience and knowledge gained by many


-----

inhabitants who often for good reasons were accustomed to certain diets has been
overlooked. It is only in the past decade or so that scientists have seriously started
their research to find out about the claims made for traditional foods based on the
food composition and their preparation methods.
Indian traditional diets mainly comprise dishes prepared from cereals, millets,
pulses/ legumes, nuts, fruits, vegetables, spices and herbs, food acidulants, milk and
milk products. Cereals, millets, and pulses have been an integral part of Indian foods
and are majorly used in the preparation of all meals of the day. Whole grain cereals
and millets provide macronutrients viz. carbohydrate, fats, and proteins along with
vitamins and minerals. Oilseeds/nuts provide fat soluble vitamins A, D, E, K and
water-soluble B vitamins, minerals, and protein. Staple foods are mainly prepared
from a number of different cereals and millets whereas a variety of legumes and
vegetables are used to prepare the accompanying dishes. A variety of fruits are
consumed as such as per seasonal availability without processing. Acidulants, spices
and herbs are added in most food preparations to provide taste and aroma to the
preparation. Cow milk is essentially traditional to Indian diets especially for infants
and children, but adults too consume it universally. *Dahi* which is a fermented curd
made from milk is consumed during meals.
###### ***18.3.1 Cereals and Millets***

Whole cereals with their low glycemic index help in reduction of blood sugar
levels, and they further aid in blood pressure regulation, thyroid, cardiovascular
and celiac diseases. In India pearl millet ( *Pennisetum glaucum* ), sorghum ( *Sorghum*
*bicolor* ), finger millet i.e., *ragi* ( *Eleusine coracana* ), little millet ( *Panicum suma-*
*trense* ), foxtail millet ( *Setaria italica* ), kodo millet ( *Paspalum scrobiculatum* ), barnyard millet ( *Echinochloa esculenta* ) and borso millet ( *Panicum millaceum* ) are cultivated from ancient times. In India, these millets are consumed in the form of breads
known as *bhakri* (Maharashtra), *rotlo* (Gujrat), and *roti* . Also, these can be served
in the form of *khichdi* prepared with legumes, spices, and *ghee* . In South India,
fermented form of millets is consumed as *dosa, idli, appam* and *uthappam* . In
Karnataka, *ragi mudda*, *jolyade rotti* are quite popular. In Maharashtra, millets are
also enjoyed during harvest festival wherein they are roasted and consumed with
spices and lime juice (Samarth et al. 2018). Millets are also consumed in the form
of *Thalipith* which is a multigrain spicy flat bread. In some regions of India, millets
are consumed in the form of *laddus*, *chakli* and *chat* (Singh et al. 2016). All these
dishes with specific preparation procedures are super healthy and can be served to
any age group. Consumption of millet-based food preparations provide additional
benefit by being gluten-free which can be tolerated by individuals suffering from
celiac disease.

Millets are endowed with phytochemicals such as flavonones, tannins, and
flavonoids. Finger millet is rich in polyphenols along with high content of calcium,
and dietary fiber (Mathanghi and Sudha 2012). The phytochemical constituents


-----

18 Indian Traditional Foods and Diets: Combining Traditional Wisdom … 365

reported in pearl millet are tannins, steroids, phenols, alkaloids, terpenoids, cardiac
glycosides, and balsams. Kodo millet is found to have good phenolic and flavonoid
content (Sharma and Saxena 2016). Foxtail millet is one example whose composition is not very different from quinoa ( *Chenopodium quinoa* ) and is one of the oldest
surviving crops, highly adaptable to climatic changes as well as drought resistant.
Thus, instead of looking at quinoa as a superfood, contemporary recipes with foxtail
millet can be developed as a functional food.
*Ambali*, a finger-millet based fermented semi-liquid product, is a food product
from southern India especially Karnataka and Tamilnadu. This is considered as a
geriatric product due to high calcium and low resistant starch content of the finger
millet. It is consumed as such or with buttermilk added for taste and its consumption
is preferred in the summer season. The leucine to lysine ratio in the finger millet
is an indicator of its pellagragenic character. Pellagra is a disease caused due to
niacin deficiency with symptoms of diarrhea, dermatitis, and dementia. The fermentation carried out during the preparation of *Ambali* decreases the leucine to lysine
ratio thereby reducing the pellagragenic character and increases the concentration
of thiamine, riboflavin and tryptophan and bioavailability of minerals (Sarkar et al.
2015).
*Poitabhat* of Assam, *Panta Bhat* of Bengal and *Pokhalo* of Odisa are popular
fermented rice-based foods consumed during lunch and breakfast. This is consumed
with water along with cooked vegetables. The fermentation process of rice is reported
to increase vitamin B complex, and vitamin K. Fermented sour rice is energy dense
and body rehydrating food and it also controls the bowel movement and prevents
constipation. About 100 g of sour rice was found to contain 73.91 mg iron, 303 mg
sodium, 839 mg potassium, and 850 mg calcium (Ray et al. 2016). While diverse
food cultures or habits exist in the Indian subcontinent, where people in different
regions consume different kinds of staple foods based on crop availability locally,
yet every food brings in its own bioactives and health beneficial properties.
*Khichdi* is a good example of an Indian one pot meal and is a highly sought
comfort food. It is prepared by cooking rice and *dal* together and tempering with
selected spices. On the other hand, the Indian *thali* is a multiple course meal served all
together comprising of staples such as rice, *roti,* and *dal* with many accompaniments
of vegetables, salads, legume-based preparations, and curd-based preparations. In
Indian *thali*, legumes have importance as they are a main source of proteins mainly
for the vegetarians (Ananthanarayan et al. 2019). Further complimentary food ingredients which are used in one meal to fulfill the needs of essential amino acids include
combinations such as rice + *dal* which arethe staple foods of India.
###### ***18.3.2 Legumes/ Pulses***

Legumes are good sources of proteins (20–45/100 g), dietary fibers (30.5/100 g FM)
and minerals like calcium, magnesium (56 mg/100 g), potassium (955 mg/100 g),
phosphorus (451 mg/100 g), magnesium (122 mg/100 g) and iron (7.5 mg/100 g)


-----

366 J. S. Gokhale et al.

(Faris et al. 2013). Recent literature shows that bioavailability of phytochemicals
present in the legumes can be increased by soaking, fermenting, and sprouting,
and Indian legume dishes are prepared by using one of these methods (Faris et al.
2013). Legumes like chickpea ( *Cicer arietinum* ), pigeon pea ( *Cajanus cajan* ), green
gram ( *Vigna radiata* ), black eye beans ( *Vigna unguiculata* ), kidney bean ( *Phaseolus*
*vulgaris* ), black gram ( *Vigna mungo* ), red lentil ( *Lens culinaris* ), split Bengal gram
( *Cicer arietinum* ), green peas ( *Pisum sativum* ), white peas ( *Lathyrus sativus* ), horse
gram ( *Macrotyloma uniflorum* ) are majorly used in India.
In different parts of India, legumes are consumed in different forms such as in
south region legumes are generally used in *sambar* and pulses in combination with
cerealsareusedforthemakingofpopularfermentedfoodssuchas *idli*, *dosa*, *uttapam* .
The combination of cereal and pulses can be seen to be complimentary as rice lacks
the essential amino acid lysine whereas pulses lack in methionine. The fermentation
of *idli* batter is known to significantly reduce antinutrients (phytates and tannins)
associated with the legume which in turn increases the bioaccessability of zinc and
iron (Hemalatha et al. 2007). This is improved by virtue of the formation of organic
acids during the fermentation, which form soluble ligands with minerals, thereby
preventing the formation of insoluble ligands of minerals with phytates. Few reports
suggest that the preparation of *idli* with parboiled rice unlike regular rice can help to
preserve the vitamins. Thus, *idli* prepared with parboiled rice fermented with right
proportion of black gram, and then steamed can deliver healthy and tasty meal option
(Srinivasan 2010). The main process of leavening in *idli* batter formation is brought
about by heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria while the acidity is achieved by
homofermentative bacteria. The literature also suggests that fermentation increases
the levels of amylase, protease, total acids, soluble solids, lysine, cysteine, methionine, nonprotein nitrogen, soluble vitamins such as folate, vitamin A, vitamin B1,
vitamin B2, and vitamin B12 content, with reduction in antinutrient phytic acid (Ray
et al. 2016).
Glycemic index (GI) is an important nutritional concept which plays significant
role in the physiological effects of foods in relation to diseases like cardiovascular
diseases and *Diabetes mellitus* . Glycemic load (GL) reflects the total glycemic impact
of ingested carbohydrate-rich diet. Studies have shown that along with lesser physical
activity, foods with high GI and GL are responsible for risk of Type II Diabetes,
weight management and prevalence of childhood obesity. Many Indian traditional
staple foods are high in GI and GL, but combinations of different dishes are shown to
lower the GI of the overall meal and thus play important role in managing good health.
For example, *idli*, a high GI food (68), when consumed in combination with *sambhar*,
which is low in GI (24), lowers the overall GI and GL of the meal. Similarly, *dosa*,
high in GI (62), in accompaniment with mint *chutney* (GI = 27) decreases the GI and
GL of the meal (Ruchi et al. 2014). Further the ingredients used in the preparation
of these accompaniments are also having bioactives with nutraceutical properties as
described ahead in this chapter.
In the last decade, lot of research has been carried out to explore the health benefits
of legumes. The research shows that legumes are power sources of nutrients which
help to boost immunity, reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, few types of


-----

cancers such as colon, breast and prostate and help to manage obesity due to their
satiety value (Faris et al. 2013). Few examples can be considered in this regard.
Green pigeon pea seeds are considered superior to dry splits in nutrition hence in
western part of India (Maharashtra and Gujrat), these legume pods are boiled, and
seeds are eaten during celebration of harvest season. It contains phytochemicals
like alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, saponins, and terpenes (Oke 2014; Saxena et al.
2010). Besides a high nutritional value, pigeon pea is also used in traditional folk
medicine in India, China, Philippines, and some other nations. Literature on this
aspect shows that pigeon pea can prevent and curing a number of human ailments
such as bronchitis, coughs, pneumonia, respiratory infections, dysentery, menstrual
disorders, sores, wounds, abdominal tumors, tooth ache, and diabetes (Saxena et al.
2010).
Chickpea also known as *chana,* is another example of a legume which can be
discussed as India is a leading producer of chickpea i.e., 66% of the world production is from India (Rachwa-Rosiak et al. 2015). It is a power source of proteins and
is consumed in the form of *bhuna chana*, *chana chat*, *pakode/ bhajis* and variety of
*farsans* . It contains 20.9–25.27% (d/w) of protein, 6.49–9.94% (d/w) of crude fiber,
essentialaminoacids(39.89/100gprotein)andendogenousaminoacids(58.64/100g
protein) (Rachwa-Rosiak et al. 2015). It also contains lectins and agglutinins which
can be anticancer, immunomodulatory, anti-obesity in nature (Nida et al. 2017;
Sharma et al. 2019). In North India, *sattu*, made from chickpea, is consumed as
a healthy drink which is also known as ‘ *Desi Horlicks’* . This *sattu* can be consumed
as raw powder or can be used for making different recipes (Sharma et al. 2019). It
has high protein percent, high antioxidant content and phenolic content (Nida et al.
2017). *Besan laddus*, *puranpoli* are few chickpea-based traditional confections of
India.

*Kulith pithala* and *Kulith chilka*, traditional recipes from coastal Maharashtra,
*Huralisaru* with rice from Tamilnadu and *Muthirathoran* from Kerala are few exam
ples of foods made from horse gram. Horse gram is an excellent source of protein
(15–30%), carbohydrates (50–60.9%), essential amino acids, carotene, phosphorus,
iron, and vitamins such as thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, and vitamin C (Prasad and
Singh 2015). It helps to treat kidney stones, urinary diseases, piles, common cold,
throatinfection,andfever(Oke 2014;PrasadandSingh 2015).Coconutbasedcowpea
( *Vigna unguiculata* ) curry, cow pea rice, *vanpayar thoran* from south India contains
cowpea as a main ingredient whichhas 23–25% protein and 50–67% carbohydrate.
Presence of significant amounts of protein, calories, and some water-soluble vitamins, makes cowpea a promising food ingredient (Devi et al. 2015). *Chakali* is one
of the traditional foods of central region of India, which is made from *harbara dal*,
rice, *mung dal*, and *uraddal* (Jagdale and Ghodke 2020) *.* It can be considered as a
very good example of multigrain traditional food product existing even before the
advent of multigrain *atta* or multigrain bread which are recently making a place in
many food markets.
Sprouting is one of the processing techniques traditionally used in India and it has
been shown to make all the legumes more nutritious and easier to digest (Devi et al.
2015). Melatonin is a neurohormone with antioxidant properties and its secretion is

aging and related diseases (Rebollo-Hernanz et al. 2020).
###### ***18.3.3 Nuts***

Nuts have been part of Indian diets for ages. For example, the commonly consumed
peanut ( *Arachis hypogaea* ) contains vitamin E, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid,
coumaric acid, ferulic acid, flavonoids, tocopherols (α, γ and δ), tocotrienols (γ and δ)
and stilbene (Davis and Dean 2016; Asibuo et al. 2008). Less commonly consumed
nuts are almonds ( *Prunus dulcis* ), cashew nuts ( *Anacardium occidentale)*, hazelnuts ( *Corylus* ), walnuts *(Juglans regia)*, brazil nuts ( *Bertholletia excelsa* ), pistachios
( *Pistacia vera* ). Major bioactives present in the nuts are fatty acids, fibers, vitamins,
minerals, phenolics. The important fat soluble bioactives such as fatty acids, tocols,
phytosterols, sphingolipids, carotenoids, alkyl phenols are present in tree nuts. Tree
nuts have shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, hypertension and have
cholesterol lowering effect (Alasalvar et al. 2020).
Coconut ( *Cocos nucifera* ) based cuisines are majorly consumed in the coastal
region of India. Different dishes like coconut-based gravies, coconut *laddu*, coconut
milk-based *solkadhi*, coconut *chutney* are few examples. The fat content of coconut
elevates the high-density cholesterol, a good cholesterol, known to reduce the risk
of cardiovascular diseases and fiber content exhibits anti-obesity and antidiabetic
effects. Coconut also showed anticancer and antilipidemic properties with its protein,
polyphenols, and flavonoid content (Kaur et al. 2019). ***18.3.4 Fruits and Vegetables***

Climatic and physio-geographical conditions in India are suitable for growing various
kinds of horticultural crops like fruits, vegetables, nuts, spices, plantation crops. Over
the last decade, production of fruits has increased from 50.9 to 97.35 MT since 2004–
05 to 2017–18. Globally, India ranks second in the production of fruits and vegetables
(Glance 2018). While a great variety of tropical and semi-tropical fruits are cultivated
on a large scale, there are some less explored fruits with nutraceutical potential a few
of which are discussed below.

The amla fruit ( *Phyllanthus emblica* ) is consumed in raw, cooked, and pickled
forms wherein *amla* candy, *amla* squash, *amla* barfi and *amla* juice are consumed
by Indian population as health foods and a natural source of ascorbic acid. The
fruit extract has shown antilipidemic, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, anticancer,
and antiulcer activities. The high content of vitamin C and polyphenols makes it a

medicinal plant and it is also used in ayurvedic preparations like *Chavyanprash* and
*Trifala* (Sarkar et al. 2015).
Bael fruit ( *Aegle marmelos* ) is another therapeutically important fruit which
contains many bioactives like alkaloids, terpenoids, coumarins, tannins, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, and polysaccharides. It shows different therapeutic effects
like antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, antifertility and antiarthritic.
The extracts of the fruit can be used in the preparation of different functional foods
and nutraceuticals (Shashikumar et al. 2018). *Jambul* ( *Syzygium cumini* ), also known
as *Jamun, Jambol*, is a seasonal fruit of India. Barks, seeds, and leaves of *Jambol*
have shown to possess antidiarrheal, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory effects. The
extract of *Jamun seed* demonstrates antidiabetic effect (Bitencourt 2020).
Raw banana ( *Musa acuminata* ) is consumed in the southern region of India as
a vegetable preparation. Studies have shown that raw banana products improve
gastrointestinal symptoms, glycemic metabolism, weight control and renal, liver
complications related to diabetes. Thus, it can also be considered as a functional
ingredient in different functional foods (Falcomer et al. 2019).
India has 12% share in the worldwide production of vegetables and 5–6% of total
vegetable production is contributed by gourd (Cucurbitaceae) family. In India, most
consumed vegetables from this family are bitter gourd ( *Momordica charantia* ), bottle
gourd( *Lagenariasiceraria* ),ashgourd( *Benincasahispida* ),snakegourd( *Trichosan-*
*thes cucumerina* ), ridged gourd ( *Luffa acutangula* ) and pumpkin ( *Cucurbita pepo* ).
Ash gourd and bottle gourd have shown to prevent cancer and cardiovascular diseases
whereas bitter gourd plays an important role in the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases. Literature suggests that bottle gourd and bitter gourd can be used to
cure Diabetes mellitus, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and viral and bacterial infections
(Palamthodi and Lele 2014).
Bitter gourd is widely consumed vegetable preparation in Indian diet though
its bitterness limits its use. It contains charantin, polypeptides and vicine as major
bioactives which have been shown to have antidiabetic effect. Research investigations
have been conducted to reduce the bitterness of the bitter gourd extract and improve
the stability of the bioactives. Nanoliposomes have been studied as a nutraceutical
delivery system of bitter gourd bioactives (Erami et al. 2019).
###### ***18.3.5 Spices and Herbs***

Spices play a vital role in flavoring of Indian traditional foods. A perfect blend of
aromatic spices in any cuisine is a critical component of its preparation. Mustard
seeds ( *Brassica nigra* ), cumin seeds ( *Cuminum cyminum* ), asafoetida ( *Ferulaassa-*
*foetida* ), turmeric ( *Curcuma longa* ), chili pepper ( *Capsicum frutescens* ), black
pepper ( *Piper nigrum* ), fenugreek seeds ( *Trigonellafoenum-graecum* ), curry leaves
( *Murraya koenigii* ), ginger ( *Zingiber officinale* ), garlic ( *Allium sativum* ) are majorly
used spices in the Indian cuisine. *Garam masala* which is a combination of five
different spices and *sambhar masala* powder are commonly used spice blends in


-----

370 J. S. Gokhale et al.

Indian foods. These spices create hot, sour, sweet, savory, and aromatic sensation
in one meal. Some spices are used while cooking, whereas others are used as a
seasoning. Along with providing flavor, taste and aroma to the diet, spices are shown
to produce positive physiological effects on the human body. Since the last three
decades, experimental documentation of the beneficial effects of spices is ongoing.
The most common effect of spices is its stimulating action on digestion. Based on
this, spices are used in traditional medicine for correcting digestive disorders. They
are shown to stimulate bile acid production which helps in fat digestion and absorption. Few of them show stimulation of digestive enzyme such as lipase. Thus, there
is abundant literature demonstrating the health beneficial effects of spices used in
Indian traditional foods such as improving gut health, immune function, in weight
management, in reduction of blood cholesterol and reducing the risk of heart diseases
(Srinivasan 2010). Thus, with 5000 years long history of use, spices can be considered as first-ever recorded functional foods and they can be used for extraction of
bioactives/ functional ingredient for use in nutraceutical preparation.
It has been reported that Asian population shows lesser incidences of neurodegenerative diseases as compared to the rest of the world who do not consume as many
spices in their daily diet. Literature supports the fact that nutraceuticals derived
from spices such as turmeric, black pepper, red pepper ( *Capsicum annuum* ), clove
( *Syzygium aromaticum* ), ginger, garlic, coriander ( *Coriandrum sativum* ), cinnamon
( *Cinnamomum verum* ) prevent neurodegenerative disorders by targeting inflammatory pathways. Out of these, majorly curcumin from turmeric is vastly explored and
available in different commercial forms. There is scope for exploring other spices for
the production of new generation nutraceuticals whose benefits can be established
with scientific evidence (Peter and Babu 2012).
Turmeric is majorly used spice in Indian staple foods. Curcumin, the main bioactive component of turmeric, has shown a wide spectrum of pharmacological effects
such as anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antirheumatic, immunomodulatory and
anticancer effects (Afolayan et al. 2018). It also shows antioxidant properties. The
major challenge of using curcumin as a nutraceutical is its poor oral bioavailability.
Research showed that co-administration of curcumin with natural compounds such
as piperine from black pepper, quercetin from different fruits and vegetables and
silibinin from milk thistle ( *Silybum marianum* ) decreased metabolism of curcumin
by enzyme inhibition and thereby increased the amount of curcumin available
for absorption (Liu et al. 2020). *Molagurasam*, a popular thin soup-like preparation of South India which is traditionally prescribed for respiratory infections may
have unknowingly demonstrated its efficacy through use of pepper ( *molagu* ) and
turmeric in combination thereby enhancing the bioavailability of curcumin along
with accompanying nutraceutical benefits.
Fresh curry leaves, having citrusy aromatic notes, have been used in Indian
cooking especially in central and south Indian cuisines. They are used directly in
the preparation of different curries and used in the form of the powder which can be
served with other accompaniments. They contain good amount of polyphenols which
show antioxidant properties. Alcoholic extract of curry leaves has shown antioxidant
properties and can be used as nutraceutical preparation (Ningappa et al. 2008).

Ginger and garlic are commonly used in many Indian dishes to improve the taste,
flavor and they also provide many health beneficial effects. Bioactives present in
garlic have shown to decrease triglycerides, cholesterol and decrease hypertension
whereas ginger helps to obtain relief from cough, cold and flu. Coriander, cumin, and
fennel ( *Foeniculum vulgare* ) are also majorly used spices in Indian cuisines which
contain quercetin as an active component which plays a major role in prevention of
cancer. Fenugreek seeds show antidiabetic and hypocholesteremic properties (Peter
and Babu 2012).
###### ***18.3.6 Food Acidulants***

Lime ( *Citrus aurantiifolia* ), tamarind ( *Tamarindus indica* ), *kokum* ( *Garcinia indica* ) *,*
and *amchur* powder (dry raw mango powder) are known food acidulants which are
used in many Indian culinary preparations to impart sour taste to the food products.
It has been reported that the organic acids present in these ingredients help in the
absorption of zinc and iron from food grains and beta-carotene from green leafy
vegetables. Thus, these food acidulants which are used in the Indian cuisine to impart
sour taste also help in improving the bioaccessability of the micronutrients from
grains and vegetables (Srinivasan 2010).
Dried rinds of *kokum* are used as a food acidulant in the coastal regions of India.
*Kokum sharbat* and *kokum aagal* are two products from Konkan region of Maharashtra. *Kokum* is also commonly used in curry preparations. The dark red fruit of
*kokum* has shown anti-obesity properties due to the presence of hydroxycitric acid
whereas antioxidant, antibacterial, gastroprotective and chemo-preventive effects
are exhibited by garcinol. *Kokam solkadhi* is a delightful appetizer drink prepared
with coconut milk and *kokam* . It is majorly consumed in coastal region of India. The
phytoconstituents present in *kokam*, majorly hydroxy citric acid, phenolics and anthocyanins, have shown to exhibit antibacterial, antifungal, anti-ulcerogenic, cardioprotective, chemo-preventive, antioxidant, and anti-obesity effects (Baliga et al.
2011). ***18.3.7 Milk and Milk Products***

Milk and milk products play very important role in the Indian diet. ‘ *Haldi* milk’
which is consumed by most of the Indian population for centuries is now globally
accepted as ‘ *Turmeric latte* ’ and has therapeutic value because of curcumin from
turmeric. Indian diets, especially in central and southern parts of India, usually have
one serving of *Dahi* (yogurt) almost every day. *Dahi* is a naturally fermented milk
product with lactic acid bacteria. Literature suggests that it is a good source of folic
acid, vitamin B complex and riboflavin while it also provides probiotic effect thus
maintaining the gut health. Diacetyl, hydrogen peroxide, and reuterin found in *dahi*


-----

372 J. S. Gokhale et al.

inhibit *E. coli*, *Bacillus subtilis* and *Staphylococcus aureus* . *Dahi* helps to control
diarrhea in children. *Chilika* curd is a famous dish of Odisa which is prepared from
concentrated buffalo milk. *Chilika* ’s shelf life is higher than regular *dahi* due to
the antifungal properties of dendrocin, a constituent of the bamboo ( *Bambusoideae* )
leaves used during the preparation (Sarkar et al. 2015).
*Ghee* is commonly used ingredient in all Indian traditional foods being a major
source of energy. Recent literature shows that milk fat contains conjugated linoleic
acid, butyric acid and vitamins which have anticarcinogenic properties. Though
higher consumption of *ghee* was presumed to be one of the causes of heart
ailments however paradoxically *ghee* was found to show hypocholesteremic effects
(Srinivasan 2010).
Colostrum is another unconventional traditional food source in India which is

used to provide immunity. It is the breast fluid produced by mammals before breast
milk is released and considered to be very nutritious and contains high levels of
antibodies which helps fight infections. *Kharwas* is a colostrum-based sweet dish
prepared by steaming a mixture of colostrum, milk, jaggery/sugar until it coagulates
into a semisolid mass which is moulded. It has been reported that colostrum has a
high amount of lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase, and lysozyme, which have antimicrobial
and antiviral properties. Thus, colostrum contributes to the wellness status of healthy
individuals and improves healing in individuals with immune deficiency condition.
The three major components viz. lactoperoxidase, lactoferrin and lysozyme show
major effects by regulating bacterial growth, acting on peptidoglycan layer of Gramnegative bacteria causing bacterial lysis. Literature suggests that colostrum is active
against Herpes virus I and II and against gastric ulcer caused by *Helicobacter pylori* .
Some colostrum antibodies are reported to be active against the virulence factors
produced by enterohaemorrhagic strains produced by *Escherichia coli*, particularly
intimin, hemolysin etc. (Conte and Scarantino 2013; Silva et al. 2019). In addition to
the general food categories described above. Table 18.2 summarizes the bioactives
present in specific Indian traditional foods along with their health benefits.
###### **18.4 Indian Traditional Foods at Different Life Stages**

Indian tradition also considers foods with functional constituents during various
stages of life. This is because in different stages of life cycle nutritional requirements,
physiological functions and challenges faced by health are different. Table 18.3
gives some details of Indian traditional foods with functional constituents which are
recommended to specific age groups based on physiological status at different stages
of life.

For instance, infant foods such as *Bharadi* / *pej* which improve sleeping pattern,
boost immunity, is rich in protein, and good for bone development are recommended.
Pregnant women are advised to take *ragi* based products such as *ragi laddu*, and ragi
*sattva* beingrichincalcium,phosphorous,magnesium.Otherphytochemicalspresent
in these products show anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. Lactating women

are suggested to take foods which improve lactation, cure backache, and improve
bone strength. *Dinka laddu*, fenugreek *laddu*, *khaskhas kheer* and *haldi* milk are
few examples of traditional foods advised for pregnant and lactating mothers. Foods
containing high amount of protein, calcium and iron are advised for elderly people.
Amaranth ( *Amaranthus* ) grain is a pseudo-cereal having properties of both cereal
and leguminous seed and it is gluten-free. In India, it is known as “ *Rajgira* ” and
“ *Chaulai* ”. Amaranth *kheer*, Amaranth *laddu* and Amaranth *khichri* are some of the
traditional cuisines of India especially given as weaning food and for preschoolers.
Amaranth has lysine content twice that of wheat and thrice that of maize protein. It
contains high levels of riboflavin, niacin, ascorbic acid, calcium and magnesium and
low levels of antinutritional factors. It has almost 20% of the daily recommended
amount of calcium, iron, magnesium, folate per 100 g. Thus, amaranth cuisines are
considered as best suitable breakfast for preschoolers, celiac patients due to gluten
free nature and osteoporotic patients being high in calcium content. *Amaranth laddu*
is made with *jaggery* and thus high content of calcium, iron and protein makes it
suitable for pregnant and lactating women. *Amaranth kheer* and *khichri* were found
to be suitable for preschool children as amaranth is easily chewable and contains
high amount of protein and calcium. It has been reported that one serving of 250 to
300 g of amaranth *kheer* and *upma* can provide two thirds requirement of calcium
in adults and thus can be suitable to combat calcium deficiency. It can also be used
as a weaning food for infants (Raghuvanshi and Bhati 2019).
###### **18.5 Nutraceuticals in Indian Traditional Foods**

India hasa rich tradition of herbal and ayurvedic medicines, which is part of an ancient
healing science. Ancient ayurvedic practices have been the cornerstone of wellness
in India. Thus, India has played a very significant role in showing evidence-based
nutraceuticals to the world with its solid reference of Ayurveda which can be modernized through evidence-based methodologies. India is poised to be a front-runner in
the nutraceutical ingredient market due to its vast biodiversity, robust agricultural
research facilities and increasing interest in this field. Nutraceuticals are also playing
substantial role in evidence-based medicine. Major classes of bioactives/ phytochemicals present in the Indian traditional foods which can be perceived as nutraceuticals
along with their health benefits are given in Table 18.4, of which few classes have
been briefly described in the following sections. ***18.5.1 Dietary Fibers***

Dietary fibers which are also known as roughage are indigestible part of food which
body cannot digest or absorb. Depending on the water solubility they are grouped
into two classes i.e., water soluble dietary fibers such as pectin, β-glucan, and water

insoluble dietary fibers such as lignin, cellulose. They mainly help in lowering the
glycemic response of foods and prevent constipation. Indian staple foods such as
cereals, pulses, grains, vegetables, and fruits are good sources of dietary fibers
(Dhingra et al. 2012). *Ragi*, lentils, barley ( *Hordeum vulgare* ) are sources of β-glucan
which is water soluble (Kudake et al. 2018) whereas whole grains and grain flour,
variety of fruits and vegetables contain water insoluble dietary fibers. In India, fruits
and few vegetables are preferred to be eaten in the raw form. Different fruits and
vegetables with edible peels such as apple ( *Malus domestica* ), cucumber ( *Cucumis*
*sativus* ), carrot possess good content of dietary fibers which can be extracted from
fruit pomace which is a waste generated in fruit processing.
###### ***18.5.2 Fatty Acids***

Certain omega-3 fatty acids (α-linolenic acid) and omega-6-fatty acids (linoleic acid)
cannot be synthesized by our body and are considered as essential fatty acids. The
ideal ratio of omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids is 4:1 or lower. These fatty
acids play important role in the synthesis of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids
(PUFAs) such as eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. But many diets
includingIndiandiethaveveryhighratioofthesameasmostvegetarianfoodscontain
high quantity of omega-6 than omega-3 fatty acids. Major sources of omega-3 fatty
acids are flaxseed ( *Linum usitatissimum* ) and seafood (Patel et al. 2020). ***18.5.3 Minerals***

Minerals are the micronutrients which are required in small amounts for the development of body. They are classified in two categories namely macro-minerals and
microminerals. Calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, chloride, phosphorus and
sulfur are macro-minerals; while trace minerals are iodine, zinc, selenium, iron,
manganese, copper, cobalt, molybdenum, fluoride, chromium and boron (Kudake
et al. 2017; Gharibzahedi and Jafari 2017). Minerals play an important role in cell
signaling, nerve signal transmission, cell communication, osmotic balance. They
are also important in many metabolic processes, enzyme activation and inhibition.
Minerals such as Ca, Mg, Mn, P, B and F help in bone development and strengthening, and Ca, P and F are required for teeth. Minerals like Co, I and Fe help during
erythrogenesis (Gharibzahedi and Jafari 2017). These minerals can be incorporated
in our diet through different vegetables, fruits, grains, cereals, and pulses. Nutrient
profile of many processed foods is being improved through fortification done with
minerals. Adequate consumption of minerals prevents body from several disorders.

###### ***18.5.4 Natural Pigments***

Carotenoids are lipid-soluble natural pigments, present in red, orange-colored fruits
and vegetables such as oranges ( *Citrus X sinensis* ), tomatoes ( *Solanum lycoper-*
*sicum* ), carrots ( *Daucus carota* subsp. sativus). β-carotene is dietary source of provitamin A which plays important role in eye health (Mezzomo and Ferreira 2016).
Lutein and zeaxanthin, present in green leafy vegetables, reduce the risk of agerelated macular degeneration and cataracts (Becerra et al. 2020). Other natural
pigments like betalains, and anthocyanins play role in scavenging free radicals, help
in brain function and detoxification of body (Joaquín-Cruz et al. 2015; Sawicki, and
Wiczkowski 2018). ***18.5.5 Probiotics and Prebiotics***

Probiotics are live microorganisms which when ingested in adequate amount confer
gut health benefits whereas prebiotics are food for gut microbiota. Indian traditional
foods are rich sources of probiotics and prebiotics. Curd and buttermilk which are
consumed by majority of the population are probiotic sources and whole grains,
onions ( *Allium cepa* ), garlic, banana are few examples of prebiotics consumed in
traditional foods. Metabolic syndrome represents a set of metabolic abnormalities
andclinicalfactorsincludinginsulinresistance,dyslipidaemia,hypertension,abdominal obesity all of which may increase the risk for cardiovascular disease and type
2 diabetes mellitus. The modulation of gut flora by supplementation with probiotics and prebiotics may have a potential beneficial influence on management of
metabolic syndrome (Xavier-Santos et al. 2020). However extensive research studies
are required to explore the therapeutic effect of probiotics and prebiotics from Indian
traditional foods in the treatment of metabolic syndrome.
Further, para-probiotics and postbiotics are emerging options as functional foods
conferring health benefits. Para-probiotics are “inactivated (non-viable) microbial
cells, which, when consumed demonstrate health beneficial properties” while postbiotics are “metabolic by-products of LAB which are excreted by the cells during
growth” (Aguilar-Toaláet al. 2018; Taverniti and Guglielmetti 2011). There are
some commonly consumed traditional food preparations in India made by cooking
fermented substrates. *Idli* is one such example wherein a fermented rice and black
gram batter is steam cooked. While the cooking will inactivate the microbial cells
(LAB is involved in *idli* batter fermentation) the steamed *idli* is still likely to provide
some health beneficial properties based on concept of para-probiotics and postbiotics.
A similar idea can be proposed with respect to *kadhi,* a traditional preparation made
by heating sour curds and tempering it with spices. While curds will be a source
of LAB cultures the *kadhi* prepared by heating curds could be a potential source
of para-probiotics and postbiotics. However, this again calls for extensive research

investigations to validate this hypothesis by firstly evaluating the probiotic potential of LAB cultures present in these fermented substrates and thereafter evaluating
the effect of thermal treatment used in their preparation on such health beneficial
properties.
###### ***18.5.6 Antioxidants***

Antioxidants inhibit oxidation reaction caused by free radicals and prevent cell
destruction. They give protection from oxidative stress which helps in prevention of
heart diseases, cancer, arthritis, stroke, respiratory diseases and immune deficiency
(Goufo and Trindade 2014). Different nuts commonly consumed contain variety of
compounds with antioxidant potential. Black gram consists of *o* -dihydroxy phenols,
flavonols, tannins (Kamboj and Nanda 2018) whereas chickpea consists of flavonols,
flavone glycosides, oligomeric as well as polymeric pro-anthocyanidins, cinnamic
acid, salicylic acid, hydroxycinnamic acid, *p* -coumaric acid, gallic acid, caffeic acid,
vanillic acid, ferulic acid, anise acid, tannic acid, piperonyl, and chlorogenic acid
(Gupta et al. 2017; Rachwa-Rosiak et al. 2015). Rice contains phenolic acids,
flavonoids, anthocyanins, pro-anthocyanidins, tocopherols, tocotrienols, oryzanol,
and phytic acid (Goufo and Trindade 2014). Carotene, lycopene, betanin are mainly
present in vegetables having antioxidant properties. Vitamins also possess antioxidantproperties.Thus,majorityoftheIndianfoodscontainbioactiveswithantioxidant
potential *(also see the chapter on nutritional hormetins in this book.)* **18.6 Summary and Future Perspectives**

Traditional foods have nourished mankind for centuries. India with its great diversity of food cultures and its people following a predominantly vegetarian diet has
for several decades been following a diet rich in a variety of phytoconstituents long
before the terms like “nutraceuticals” and “functional foods” were coined. With its

warm tropical climate and agricultural activities India also enjoys a great biodiversity
in the form of a variety of fruits, vegetables, grains, spices, and herbs each of them
being a powerhouse of phytochemicals. Indian traditional wisdom practiced with
respect to dietary habits believes in consuming a variety of food sources of seasonal
and local availability. This ensures consumption of a great variety of phytochemicals
which today we recognize as having nutraceutical value. Traditional wisdom has also
acknowledged the important role of food in maintaining health. Complimentary to
this is the ancient health science of Ayurveda which also gives dietary recommendations to manage health. However, this valuable knowledge of health promoting
properties of Indian foods has not been extensively or systematically documented
while most of it has just been transmitted through generations by word of mouth.

While the Indian people have been habitually following this healthy diet for all
these years however of late due to changing lifestyles, increasing participation of
women in professional domain, increasing affordability and easy availability of junk
food, paucity of time for food preparation, the dietary habits of people especially
in metro cities have changed and consumption of refined foods with high energy
density but poor nutritional value has increased. Lifestyle associated diseases are
concomitantly on the rise. Therefore, it is imperative that recognition be given to the
importance of nutraceuticals and functional foods. There is a need to scientifically
explore the nutraceutical potential of traditional food ingredients and to acknowledge
some of the traditional foods as functional foods. This knowledge when based on
sound scientific data will find greater acceptance with the present generation. Instead
of purchasing expensive formats of nutraceuticals and functional food products the
individuals can then rely on traditional foods to supply them with health beneficial
constituents which will be both acceptable and affordable. What we know today
in this regard is just the tip of the iceberg while a lot remains to be discovered.
A systematic exploration of all types of Indian foods consumed in different parts
of the Indian subcontinent for establishing their phytochemical profile needs to be
undertaken. The effect of raw material quality and variety on the bioactive profile
needs to be considered. Robust clinical studies need to be undertaken to establish

their health beneficial properties. This will help to rediscover the value of these
foods and promote them for present and future generations. The bioavailability of
the phytoconstituents and factors affecting it needs to be understood. The ability
of other food constituents in promoting/inhibiting the absorption of phytochemicals
has to be studied. Certain combinations of ingredients used in the preparation of
traditional foods or certain combinations of preparations eaten together as a meal can
improve the bioavailability or have some complimentary effect which also needs to be
evaluated. There is also possibility of employing appropriate processing technologies
to transform traditional forms of products into convenient modern formats for today’s
consumer. The processing and storage stability of the bioactive constituents in these
food products must be therefore established if one has to prepare such products on a
large scale for wide distribution.
There are a number of edible plant sources such as fruits and vegetables which are
relatively unexplored, not widely cultivated and only consumed locally and seasonally by a small community of people. Such natural food sources can also have a hitherto unexplored therapeutic potential, about which some knowledge may be present
in restricted local communities. This also needs to be investigated. The wastes generated in food processing industries can themselves be a source of bioactives either
directly or through suitable conversion techniques employed. This can help in the
recovery of valuable by products in the form of bioactives. Thus, many avenues of
research and development are opening up for authenticating the value of traditional
wisdom and for exploring the health beneficial properties of traditional foods.

##### **Chapter 19**
#### **Diet and Circadian Rhythms:** **Implications for Aging and Longevity**

**Anita Jagota, Zeeshan Akhtar Khan, and M. Sultan Khan**

**Abstract** Circadian rhythms are maintained by the interaction of external environmental cues with body’s molecular clock machinery and help to optimize physiological functions by temporally coordinating them at the cellular, tissue, organ and
behavioural level of an organism. Feeding-fasting pattern is one of the most important
external cues that affect the robustness of the biological rhythms. Upon aging due to
loss of indispensable neurons in the master clock- Suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN),
these rhythms get compromised and so does the temporal coordination thus leading
to various age-related pathologies. Irregular eating-fasting patterns can also temporally disrupt the coordination between metabolism and physiology, leading to the
onset of many chronic diseases and early aging. Hence, avoiding irregular feedingfasting habits and maintaining strong rhythmic cycles following optimum amplitude
and phase of rhythms can help in healthy aging and preventing diseases such as
sleep disorders, cardiovascular, metabolic disorders, diabetes, obesity, breast cancer,
inflammation, hypertension, neurodegeneration etc. Therefore, synchronizing the
external cues and timings of signals from master clock along with time restricted
eating patterns can help in sustaining a robust circadian clock. Such synchronization
will help in preventing the diseases and improving their prognosis. In this chapter,
we aim to discuss the role of diet in restoration of age-induced circadian dysfunction.

###### **19.1 Introduction**

Circadian rhythms are evolutionarily conserved biological rhythms in almost all
organisms ranging from archaea to mammals. Circadian (Latin: *circa* – approximately; *di¯em* – day) rhythms are approximately 24 hour(h) rhythmic oscillations that
regulate the physiology of an organism at molecular and behavioural level (Whitehead et al. 2009; Edgar et al. 2012). The adaptation to external environmental conditions using clock system allows an organism to predict changes and give an advantage
to survival (Kondratov et al. 2006). Many diseases are associated with disruptions
in the circadian clock like psychological disorders, sleep disorders, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, insomnia, fatigue, disorientation and hormonal
profile shifts in night shift workers etc. (Hofman et al. 2006; Gibson et al. 2009).
During aging, there is a shift in both amplitude and phases of circadian rhythm
(Gibson et al. 2009; Jagota 2012).
Circadian rhythms have evolved as an adaptation to the oscillations found in
the environment and to get entrained by them, notably to the day-night cycle
(Jagota 2006). In the case of mammals, the main circadian rhythm regulator is
SCN containing ~20,000 neurons located in the hypothalamic region. It acts as a
timekeeper in controlling and synchronizing the circadian period of many physiological and behavioral functions and entraining them to 24 h light and dark cycles
(Jagota et al. 2000; Jagota 2006; Takahashi et al. 2017). Three major pathways,
Retino-hypothalamic tract (RHT) **,** Geniculo-hypothalamic tract (GHT), and Retinoraphe pathway (RRP) receive the information from the environment through several
cues such as photic (light) and non-photic cues (food, sound, humidity etc.). All
these pathways diverge from the retinal ganglion cells before they enter into the
SCN. Among these three, RHT is a photic pathway that has a direct synaptic
contact of retinal ganglionic cells with the SCN; GHT is an indirect photic pathway
where the retina conveys input signals to Intergeniculate Nucleus (IGL) via a separate branch of RHT that overlaps with the RHT terminals in the SCN; RRP is
the third major input pathway which participates in the non-photic regulation of
the SCN, where neuronal fibres from raphe nuclei end in the core region of the
SCN (Jagota 2012).The auto-regulatory transcriptional and translational feedback
loops drive the coordinated expression of genes such as ( *Clock* )-circadian locomotor
output cycles kaput *, (Bmal1)-Brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear*
*translocator-like protein 1* ) *, (Per1)-Period1, (Per2)-Period2, (Per3)-Period3, (Cry1)-*
*Cryptochrome1, (Cry2)-Cryptochrome2, (Ror)-retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear*
*receptors,* and *(Rev-Erb)-reverse erythroblastosis virus* etc. at both levels (Takahashi
2017).
The SCN plays the role of central clock or the relay centre of information. It
regulates the release of neurohormone melatonin, the messenger of time from pineal
gland. Melatonin then synchronizes the peripheral clocks with the central clock
(Vriend and Rieter 2014). Every mammalian cell is autonomous and has its own
clock machinery constituting the peripheral clock system controlled by the SCN
through both sympathetic as well as parasympathetic pathways (Kalsbeek et al.

2010). The endogenous rhythms of clock gene expression have been reported by
researchers in cell culture of peripheral clocks like liver, adrenal glands, hormones
like adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and glucocorticoids (Cailotto et al. 2005;
Mahoney et al. 2010).
###### **19.2 Food as an Important Clock Regulator**

Food has been reported as an important non-photic *zeitgeber* (ZT) or time giver to
synchronize an organism’s biological rhythms and shifting the timing of food leads
to the shift in the activity of an organism (Carneiro et al. 2012). In SCN lesioned
mice, food restriction has demonstrated to induce locomotor behaviours as well
as temperature rhythms (Froy et al. 2010). Food timings entrain circadian clocks
in different brain regions and most peripheral organs, thereby synchronizing their
daily rhythms. This entrainment of peripheral clocks to mealtime is accomplished
by multiple feeding-related signals, including absorbed nutrients and metabolic
hormones,actinginparallelorseriesinatissue-specificmanner.Signalsthatsynchronize circadian clock in the brain with feeding time are presumed to generate the
circadian rhythms of food-anticipatory activity (FAA) that emerge when food is
restricted to a fixed daily mealtime. Such FAA is regulated and paced by the foodentrainable oscillator (FEO) located outside the SCN (Flores et al. 2016; Chaudhari
et al. 2017). Several timekeeping mechanisms involved in the FAA occurring before
food intake include neuronal activation, molecular clock entrainment, hormonal cues,
and metabolic regulation (Tahara et al. 2013; Challet 2019). The synchronization
between food entrainable clock and central clock system is driven by a complex
mechanism including humoral and enzymatic regulatory pathway (Challet 2019). βhydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) synthesized in the liver during fasting conditions has been
proposed to be a key candidate molecule in those pathways. Apart from being an
energy source, β-OHB has many cellular signalling actions and participates in FAA
modulation and its production is clock regulated involving *Per2* (Newman et al.
2017). **19.3 Food and Melatonin Hormone**

The synthesis and release of melatonin from the pineal gland is under regulation of
the SCN. The photic cues are received by the SCN clock and relayed to pineal gland
through a multi-synaptic pathway. Melatonin is a “night-time hormone” in all the
animals (diurnal, nocturnal and crepuscular) irrespective of their activity niche and
thus called messenger of darkness (Jagota et al. 2012; 2019). Melatonin is synthesised from serotonin through N-acetylation followed by methylation reaction in the
presence of arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT; rate limiting enzyme) and
hydroxyl indole-O-methyl-transferase (HIOMT) respectively (Jagota et al. 2012).


-----

396 A. Jagota et al.

Endogenous melatonin rhythm modulates feeding and fasting behaviour and anticipation of meal time. Melatonin cues modulate the phase and amplitudes of various
hormonal rhythms including rhythms of cortisol and insulin (Challet et al. 2019).
Reduced levels of melatonin has been associated with aging (Reddy and Jagota
2015). Melatonin is an important hormetin (Jagota et al. 2019), and its manipulation with dietary interventions in elderly may lead to restoration of circadian clock
functions and improvement of health and wellbeing.
###### **19.4 Circadian Dysfunction with Aging**

Aging is an inevitable unidirectional natural process in the lifespan of an organism.
Thedisruptionoftheendogenousnatureofthemolecularclock,deterioratedtemporal
synchronisation of the oscillators and an overall change in the physiology dampens
the circadian rhythm as the organism ages (Jagota et al. 2000; Manoogiana and Panda
2017; Jagota et al. 2019). A phase advance in body temperature and melatonin secretion rhythms has been associated with aging in humans. Alterations in the daily
rhythms of clock genes (Mattam and Jagota 2014), serotonin metabolism (Kalyani
and Jagota 2008; 2010; Reddy and Jagota 2015), antioxidant enzymes (Manikonda
and Jagota 2012), leptin (Reddy and Jagota 2014), nitric oxide (NO), and Suppressor
of cytokine signaling ( *Socs* ) (Vinod and Jagota 2016; 2017) expression has been
reported from our laboratory. Additionally, alterations in daily rhythms of Sirtuin1
(Sirt1), Nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2), Rev-erbα and inflammatory markers including Nfkb1, Tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf-α), Interleukin6 (Il-6), Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4) and Toll-like receptor 9 (Tlr9) affecting circadian
timing system (CTS) were observed with aging (Thummadi and Jagota 2019; Kukkemane and Jagota 2020). As endogenous rhythms dampen and deteriorate with age,
the contribution by the external cues and its timing starts playing an increasingly
critical role in maintaining the amplitude and phase of an organism’s circadian clock
(Manoogian and Panda 2017; Jagota et al. 2020). **19.5 Circadian Rhythms, Metabolism and Homeostasis** **with Aging**

Thecircadianclockcontrolsenergymetabolismandmaintainshomeostasisinperipheral tissues through the controlled expression of various metabolic hormones like
leptin, ghrelin, secretin etc. involved in different metabolic pathways. This helps
in maintaining the normal physiological functions and healthy aging (Green et al.
2008; Froy 2009).The circadian clock is itself under metabolic regulation and the
disturbances induced by a nutrient imbalance results in circadian dysfunction (Chaix
et al. 2014). Many hormones such as insulin, glucagon adiponectin, corticosterone,


-----

19 Diet and Circadian Rhythms … 397

and ghrelin have been found to show circadian expression and oscillation (Ando
et al. 2005; Yang et al. 2006). The temporal regulation of insulin which shows a
peak in its production at 1700 h and a nadir at 0400 h is achieved by both the
patterns of feeding-fasting and SCN signalling (Sadacca et al. 2011; Vieira et al.
2015). Leptin, a well-known appetite repressor also shows circadian rhythmicity in
its expression. The removal of the SCN abolishes the rhythmicity of its secretion in
rodents leading to uncontrolled feeding behaviour, obesity, pathologies, and early
aging effects suggesting the role of the clock system in aging, metabolism and maintaining homeostasis (Kalra et al. 2003). The receptors for leptin and ghrelin have
been demonstrated in SCN (Yi et al. 2006; Zigman, et al. 2006) thus, establishing a
direct link between the main circadian clock (SCN) and metabolism (Prosser et al.
2003). Metabolism is also influenced by the microbiome which makes an important component of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). The microbiome shows rhythmic
oscillations in its composition as per the requirement in GIT for proper metabolism.
Erratic feeding patterns can dampen the taxonomic diversity and disrupt the oscillating rhythm of the microbiome, contributing to metabolic disorders like intestinal
dysbiosis, obesity, and early aging (Voigt et al. 2016). Forced feeding-fasting patterns
achieved by different strategies like intermittent fasting (IF), periodic fasting (PF),
and calorie restriction (CR) have been shown to restore some of these oscillations to
normal and achieve healthy aging (Zarrinpar et al. 2014).
###### **19.6 Chrononutrition: Timing of Food as a Therapeutic** **Intervention**

Due to demanding work pressure and changing food habits, unhealthy and unscheduled meals including junk food have now become a part of our lifestyle. Such
unscheduled meals with unhealthy amounts of sugar, salts, caffeine, processed meat,
fats and an inadequate intake of fruits, green leafy vegetables, cereals etc. are the
major risk factors for developing age-related pathologies and accelerate the aging
process (Micha et al. 2017). Patterns of feeding and fasting can potentially contribute
to the development of chronic pathologies and thus have an influential impact on
human health and onset of diseases (Zarrinpar et al. 2014). Although clock oscillatorsinourbodycanrecuperatefrommildalterationinourdailyfeedingtimes,chronic
imbalanced and unscheduled feeding behaviour results in untimed cues, circadian
dysfunction and disease pathologies later in life with unhealthy aging (Asher and
Sassone-Corsi 2015; Lopez-Minguez et al. 2019). Thus, the temporal attributes of
food and its role in health and disease are as vital as the qualitative and quantitative
nutritional aspects (Gupta et al. 2017; Kant et al. 2018).

###### ***19.6.1 Food, Energy Metabolism, Circadian Dysfunction,*** ***and Aging***

Various mitochondrial rate-limiting enzymes are rhythmically expressed (NeufeldCohen et al. 2016). In circadian mutant mice, enforced feeding-fasting patterns can
reinstate rhythmic expression of some of metabolites, such as Acylcarnitine carrier
protein and Acyl CoA Dehydrogenase (Manoogian and Panda 2016; Neufeld-Cohen
et al. 2016). Mice with a deleted exon-19 of the *Clock* gene shows an altered feeding
rhythm, over-eating, obesity and other metabolic syndromes like high blood leptin,
lipids and glucose levels (Turek et al. 2005). Such mutant ( *Clock* *[�]* [19] ) mice also
showed a decrease in the expression of hypothalamic peptides like ghrelin and orexin,
which are important for energy balance (Turek et al. 2005). *Per2* mutations abolished
rhythmicity for glucocorticoids, feeding patterns and caused obesity (Yang et al.
2009).
Aging leads to significant disruption in adipogenesis by affecting circadian
components, *Bmal1, Rev-erbα* causing multiple pathologies like obesity, cardiovascular diseases and decline in longevity (Duez et al. 2008). Peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor α (PPARα) is important for transcriptional activation of *Bmal1*
and genes responsible for the metabolism of lipids and glucose (Lefebvre et al.
2006; Lamia et al. 2008). Impairment of PPAR *α* leads to defective fatty acid oxidative pathways, enhanced inflammatory response, oxidative stress and renal fibrosis
and impaired energy metabolism (Adnan 2007). Adenosine 5 [′] -monophosphate–
activated protein kinase (AMPK), an energy sensor of cells integrates the circadian clock with metabolism by regulating the response to feeding and modulating
NAD [+] levels and SIRT1 activity (Hardie et al. 2006; Canto et al. 2009). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), a transcriptional co-activator of *Bmal1* and *Rev-erbα* also regulates energy metabolism.
Disrupted expressions of AMPK and PGC-1α leads to abnormal daily diurnal
rhythms, body temperature energy imbalance, metabolic disorders, multiple pathologies and early aging (Grimaldi et al. 2007). Another important protein found to
display a link between metabolism and the circadian clock of mammals is SIRT1.
The influence of nutrient state and the circadian clock on insulin sensitivity is via
SIRT1 (Bass and Takahashi 2010). It is an NAD [+] dependent histone deacetylase that
plays an important role in extending the life span in yeast, *Caenorhabditis elegans*,
Drosophila and mice (Mair et al. 2008; Canto et al. 2009). SIRT1 can interact with
CLOCK directly and deacetylate BMAL1 and PER2 in cultured fibroblasts (Asher
et al. 2008; Nakahata et al. 2008). The information on the food, circadian clock,
and metabolic factors discussed here has been compiled as a schematic diagram in
Fig. 19.1.

**Fig 19.1** Simplified schematic representation of the link between circadian clock, metabolism

circadian components like *Bmal1, Clock, Rev-erbα* etc *.* and metabolic components like Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α). Also, feeding and fasting cycle, controlled by Adenosine 5 [′] monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK), with the involvement of NAD [+], and SIRT1 gets
desynchronised upon aging. This age induced desynchronization between clock and metabolism

leads energy imbalance, metabolic disorders and accelerated aging. = Abolition of

###### **19.7 Various Dietary Interventions: Circadian Clock,** **Aging and Longevity**

Dietary intervention is an ancient practice and various researchers using experimental
models from invertebrates ( *C. elegans* ) to mammals (rat/mice) have demonstrated
mean life-span extension by using different strategies of dietary interventions (Di
Francesco et al. 2018). Such strategies (Table 19.1) achieved either by fasting for a
certain period or reducing the calorie intake are discussed below. ***19.7.1 Restricted Feeding (RF)***

Restricting food to a particular time of the day while still ensuring nutritional
adequacy is called restricted feeding (RF) (Froy et al. 2010). RF controls the FAA,

which includes corticosterone secretion, gastrointestinal motility and activity of
digestive enzymes before meals (Stephan et al. 2002). RF is dominant over the SCN
and able to drive the rhythms in clock mutant rodents and animals with lesioned
SCN regardless of photic cues (Hara et al. 2001; Stephan 2002). But in some cases,
RF only affects the clock system in peripheral tissues such as the heart, kidney,
pancreas and liver, causing their uncoupling from the SCN, followed by metabolic
disorders, pathologies and early aging (Schibler et al. 2003; Hirota et al. 2004). This
suggests the nutritional regulation of clock oscillators in peripheral tissues and its
involvement in metabolic disorders and aging (Lin et al. 2008). Damiola et al. 2000

demonstrated when the food availability is made normal, the SCN, whose phase
remains unaffected, resets the peripheral oscillators and synchronization of physiology. *Per2* mutant mice do not show wheel-running food anticipation (Mistlberger
2006). In one of the interesting studies, the survival time of mice inoculated with
osteosarcoma was prolonged under RF (Wu et al. 2004). RF has been found to modify
the expression of genes responsible for carcinogenesis and tumor progression such
as c-myc and p53 (Filipski et al. 2005) but whether RF affects life span in a real
sense or not is still not clear.
###### ***19.7.2 Intermittent Fasting (IF)***

IF is a cyclic pattern of eating and fasting, one of the regimen of IF is alternate day
fasting (ADF), where food is available *ad-libitum* every alternate day (Froy et al.
2010). Two more variations of IF include: Periodic Fasting (PF) which lasts for 2
or more days followed by the next cycle after 6–7 days (Longo et al. 2016; Vargas
et al. 2020) and Time restricted feeding (TRF), where food is taken in a specific
time window of 8 h or less (Mattson et al. 2017). Recently, IF has gained popularity
due to its various beneficial effects on health (De Cabo et al. 2019). Animals on IF
exhibit increased life span, improved glucose metabolism, cardio physiology, neuroprotection and resistance towards cancer (Descamps et al. 2005; Mattson et al. 2005;
Varady et al. 2007). Rev-erbα, an important component of the circadian clock, also
regulates the expression of genes involved in metabolism and inflammation. It was
observed that there is an average 11 fold increase in its levels at the end of the 4th
week during 30-days of IF (Mindikoglu et al. 2020). RF schedules elicit a phase shift
in molecular and metabolic machinery components of peripheral clocks. Likewise,
imposed periods of extended daily fasting, independent of dietary composition and
calorie intake have significant metabolic and lifespan benefits (Mitchell et al. 2018). ***19.7.3 Time-Restricted Feeding (TRF)***

A feeding regime like Time-restricted feeding (TRF) has shown beneficial effects
in animals and is believed to compensate and consolidate the circadian rhythms
(Chaix et al. 2014; De Cabo and Mattson 2019). Flies on TRF showed a sustained
nocturnal sleep which is about double the total sleep duration of the flies with food
ad libitum (Gill et al. 2015). Nocturnal rodents given TRF with food ad libitum
during the light phase (normally their rest period) show altered expression of clock
genes and clock-controlled genes (CCGs) in the peripheral tissues without affecting
SCN (Damiola et al. 2000; Stokkan et al. 2001). A differential adaption to the novel
feeding regimens has been observed in peripheral clocks where Kidneys, lungs, or
heart adapts to changes slower than the liver. TRF of normal diets improves energy
metabolism in humans in short-term studies and contributes to a healthy life span


-----

402 A. Jagota et al.

even though calories are not restricted (Sutton et al. 2018; Jamshed et al. 2019).
High-fat diets (HFD), representing the western diet model, has been reported to cause
circadian dysfunction by disrupting the feeding-fasting rhythms and gene expression
rhythms (Hatori and Panda 2015; Potter et al. 2016). A very recent report has shown
that an extended HFD and night restricted feeding (NtRF) regimen on senescenceaccelerated mouse strain, SAMP8 ameliorates age-related phenotypes. The positive
impact of HFD has been manifested till metabolic perturbations kicked in. So, the
HFD and chrono-nutritional feeding in combination can be an effective anti-aging
strategy (Oike et al. 2020) ensuring a healthy life span.
###### ***19.7.4 Caloric Restriction (CR)***

CR has almost similar beneficial effects on health as that mediated through IF
and leads to circadian clock plasticity by chromatin remodelling (Nakahata et al.
2007). CR can induce expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the
hippocampus, phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB),
dendritic spine density and transcription of BDNF (Whitmore et al. 2000; Eide et al.
2001; Etchegaray et al. 2006). CR not only reduces the risk of age-associated circadian dysfunction and disorders but also significantly impedes aging and enhances
longevity (Taormina et al. 2014). When *Drosophila* was subjected to caloric restriction, expression of several clock genes showed increase in amplitude (Katewa et al.
2015). CR affects significantly the expression of several genes in both central clockSCN and the peripheral clocklike the liver (Patel et al. 2016). The importance of meal
timing by studies on α-MUPA mice have shown that reduced calories alone were not
able to sustain rhythms unless feeding was spontaneously timed at night, or the day
through a RF protocol. Further, to investigate the involvement of the circadian clock
in impacting the metabolic activity and life span via CR, core clock gene knockouts
were used ( *Bmal1* in mice and *Per* and *Timeless* ( *Tim)* in Drosophila); circadian clock
disruption along with multiple metabolic disorders and increased life span was noted
in such experiments (Patel et al. 2016; Katewa et al. 2015). In mammals, CR mediates
decline in blood IGF-1 level and the effect was compromised in mice deficient for
BMAL1, an important circadian transcriptional factor. With CR, the diurnal activity
and sleep pattern dampens in fruit flies as seen in humans with night sleep pattern.
An overall diagrammatic representation of effects of different feeding regimens on
aging and longevity has been summarised as Fig. 19.2.

**Fig 19.2** A diagrammatic representation of the effect of feeding regimens on aging and longevity
through resetting of central and peripheral clock system. Intermittent fasting, caloric restriction,
time restricted feeding, and high fat diet with TRF helps in resetting the circadian rhythms in both
peripheral and the central clock systems but RF resets the rhythms only in the peripheral clocks
###### **19.8 Nutritional Epigenetic: Aging and Clock**

The nutritional modulation of the circadian clock has been reported to be linked with
the epigenetic regulation of various clock genes. The modifications by sirtuins, a class
III NAD [+] dependent diet-sensitive histone deacetylase enzymes, are of vital importance to genome stability. *Sirt1* is believed to be a key epigenetic regulator protecting
the mammals from events and consequences that ultimately lead to aging (Hudec
et al. 2020). Higher *Silent information regulator 2* ( *Sir2;* mammalian *Sirt1* equivalent) expression has been reported to extend the lifespan in *Drosophila melanogaster*
and *Sirt1* knock-outs die young owing to developmental defects. Single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNPs) gene variants for core clock genes have been implicated in
age related disorders and individual dietary response in humans. Among the epigenetic mechanisms that control circadian rhythms, microRNAs are the least studied
ones compared to SNPs and such studies can be a key to novel chrono-therapeutic
interventions (Mico et al. 2016). **19.9 Conclusion**

Dietary interventions are promising and easy-to-adapt strategies for the modulation
and prevention of circadian dysfunction and senescence in humans of different ages.
Recently, adjustment of caloric intake using different strategies like IF, PF and TRF
have emerged as potential strategies towards treatment of metabolic syndromes like
cardiovascular diseases, cancer and possibly neurodegenerative diseases etc. and
helping in the synchronization of the circadian clock system. RF entrains peripheral

clocks suggesting their role via temporal food consumption, whereas, CR and IF
appears to synchronize the central pacemaker in the SCN, suggesting their role
by involving low calories intake in the entrainment of the central clock system.
A direct relationship between feeding time and onset of chronic diseases such as
obesity, breast cancer and inflammatory and metabolic disorders, neurological and
sleep disorders explains that metabolic state is linked to sensitization in different
parts of the brain, especially the hypothalamus and hippocampus, to maintain the
coordination between the neuroendocrine system, metabolism, and energy balance.
The CTS, thus influences and resets a wide variety of output systems like cellular and
physiological systems to perform in a more synchronized manner hence maintaining
the robust circadian rhythms using dietary interventions can ensure better tissue and
body homeostasis and mediating aging attenuation and promoting longevity.

##### **Chapter 20**
#### **Longevity Foods in Myth, Legend** **and History**

**Ilia Stambler**

**Abstract** Human beings have always had a tremendous interest in longevity foods,
the foods that may be most beneficial for healthy longevity. This interest is natural
and may be deeply rooted in human thought and experience. The present historicalcultural analysis will survey some of the historical traditions, myths, legends, cognitive, social, cultural and ethical norms related to the varied concepts of longevity
foods, across the world, from antiquity to the early modern period. This work will
provide a multi-disciplinary framework for the discussion of longevity nutrition,
by presenting the search for longevity foods as intertwined in a rich historical,
socio-cultural, ideological and cognitive milieu conducive to the pursuit of healthy
longevity.

###### **20.1 Longevity Foods and Culture**

Human beings have always had a tremendous interest in longevity foods, the foods
that may be most conducive to healthy longevity. This interest is natural and may
be inherent in human thought and experience. Foods are the most obvious means to
sustain life and influence life’s powers. And if any and all foods can sustain life, then
it could be straightforwardly inferred that some foods may be especially potent for
sustaining life, for enhancing health and longevity. Thus, the interest in longevity
foods has been perennial and universal across cultures. Yet, often this interest has
been expressed as a demand for ‘the right recipe,’ asking what it is exactly that we
need to eat to prolong the days of our life in good health. Often it has amounted to
an even simpler demand for the right ‘nutritious pill’—conveniently prepackaged,
preferably at a discounted price—that one could swallow, without even the need to
bother with recipes and preparations. I. Stambler ( B )

However, a cultural study would reveal that the search for longevity foods is much
more complex than simply listing the right nutritious ingredients. Rather, it involves
the construction of elaborate social practices, normative behaviors and even rituals
for the obtaining, preparing and consuming of the foods. It creates articulate belief
systems, even entire historical and communal identities, philosophical worldviews,
cosmologies, mythologies and religions, woven around the foods. It entails special
patterns and modes of narration and cognition. In short, it involves the vast historical
and cultural lore integral and often determinative for the conceptions of longevity
foods. Often the cultural and ideological motifs were the primary sources for creating
the longevity recipes.
The present historical-cultural analysis will survey some of these historical traditions, myths, legends, cognitive, social and cultural norms, related to the diverse
concepts of longevity foods. The aim of this work is to advance the academic and
public interest in longevity foods, in healthy and life-prolonging nutrition. Yet, it
aims to raise this interest not by providing statistical correlations and normative
recommendations for ‘the right recipes,’ but by presenting the search for longevity
foods as intertwined in a rich historical, socio-cultural, ideological and cognitive
milieu conducive to the pursuit of healthy longevity.
###### **20.2 Longevity Foods and Magic: The Power** **of Imagination**

The discovery and development of longevity foods is now firmly associated with
scientific thought, with the standards of scientific methodology and evidence. Yet,
historically, the establishment of certain foods as longevity foods was firmly rooted
in magical thinking, sometimes coupled with and sometimes decoupled from sound
empirical observations of the foods’ benefits. Yet, the element of magical thinking
has been fundamentally present and needs to be recognized.
A classical explanation of magical thinking can be found in Sir James George
Frazer’s seminal anthropological work *The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and*
*Religion*, first published in 1890 (Frazer 1925, pp. 11–12):

If we analyse the principles of thought on which magic is based, they will probably be found
to resolve themselves into two: first, that like produces like, or that an effect resembles its
cause; and, second, that things which have once been in contact with each other continue
to act on each other at a distance after the physical contact has been severed. The former
principle may be called the Law of Similarity, the latter the Law of Contact or Contagion.
From the first of these principles, namely the Law of Similarity, the magician infers that
he can produce any effect he desires merely by imitating it: from the second he infers that
whatever he does to a material object will affect equally the person with whom the object
was once in contact, whether it formed part of his body or not. Charms based on the Law
of Similarity may be called Homoeopathic or Imitative Magic. Charms based on the Law of
Contact or Contagion may be called Contagious Magic. ... Homeopathic magic is founded
on the association of ideas by similarity; contagious magic is founded on the association of
ideas by contiguity. ... Both branches of magic, the homoeopathic and the contagious, may

conveniently be comprehended under the general name of Sympathetic Magic, since both
assume that things act on each other at a distance through a secret sympathy.

*The* *Golden* *Bough* gives a striking example of employing sympathetic/homeopathic magic—based on the principle “like produces like”—for
increasing longevity. As Frazer reports (p. 36):

To ensure a long life the Chinese have recourse to certain complicated charms, which concentrate in themselves the magical essence emanating, on homoeopathic principles, from times
and seasons, from persons and from things. … Amongst the clothes there is one robe in
particular on which special pains have been lavished to imbue it with this priceless quality.
It is a long silken gown of the deepest blue colour, with the word “longevity” embroidered
all over it in thread of gold. As the garment purports to prolong the life of its owner, he often
wears it, especially on festive occasions, in order to allow the influence of longevity, created
by the many golden letters with which it is bespangled, to work their full effect upon his

person.

Not just garments, but also other objects, including foods, could carry such a
symbolic-magical function, wishfully thought to work their imaginary effects to
extend a person’s longevity. In this mode of thought, food is not just a mere foodstuff,
but an empowering sign and symbol. The actual empirical influence, if it is indeed
observed, is secondary to the original symbolic, magical and ritualistic function of
the food.

The magical “association of ideas”—either based on “similarity” or “contiguity”—may be considered a ramification of basic human imagination, the metaphorical and metonymical thought processes that seek analogies and connections in the
world of experience. The commonality of physical forms and spatial relations may be
deeply engraved in the human mind (Johnson 1987). Thus it should not be surprising
that human imagination made various symbolic associations between human life
prolongation and various observable properties among the common foods. Various
purported healing and life-prolonging powers of foods have been derived from their
observable properties, such as “thorniness and odor,” “size,” “age,” “movement,”
“quaking and rustling of leaves,” presence of “seeds” and “exudations,” “shape,”
“color,” “place and method of growth,” etc. (Simoons 1998). Foods with attractive
attributes may have been believed to attract beneficial influences, while unattractive
foods may have been hoped to repel threats (or vice versa). Associative imagination has been the basis of the ancient medical doctrine of “signatures” according
to which the intrinsic powers of entities, either healing or impairing, are signified
by their ostensible similarities to the object of their influence (Vannier 1945). By
seeking “symbolic analogies” (“sympathies” or “affinities”) for poisons and remedies, the proponents of this doctrine hoped to discover the means that would provide
nourishment, while absorbing or expelling the poisons or excess matters, and thus
purifying the body and inducing it into a state of stable equilibrium. Beside the theorizing, analogizing and imagining, actual effects from partaking of certain foods,
either beneficial or harmful, could also have been observed, and formed the basis
for dietary recommendations. And, of course, for many foods, the imagination may
have contributed to the observed effects, due to what is now commonly referred to
as “psychosomatic” or “placebo” influences. But for many foods, such empirical

considerations appear to be only additional, and often secondary or even negligible,
compared to the magical associations.
Based on such magical associative thought principles, or the sympathetic “association of ideas,” not necessarily empirically valid, but rather intuitive and ostensible,

longevity.
The magical justifications for selecting longevity foods are salient in Traditional
Chinese Medicine, in particular in its branches stemming from the Taoist tradition
of external alchemy or external elixir production (Waidan) and internal alchemy
or body-internal elixir production (Neidan) (Kohn 2001). In traditional Chinese
culture, longevity, even extreme longevity, has always been a defining, all pervasive
pursuit, especially in Taoism (allegedly emerging c. 600 BCE with the teaching of
Lao Tse), but apparently also earlier. In the traditional Chinese household pantheon,
“Longevity” (Shou, 寿) is one of the three most venerated deities, alongside “Happiness” (Fu, 福) and “Prosperity” (Lu, 禄), altogether referred to as the “three lucky star
gods—Fu, Lu, Shou.” According to Chinese legend, the Yellow Emperor, Huangdi
(Huang-ti), fabled to have originated many fields of Chinese culture around 2600–
2700 BCE, also possessed the secret of immortality. He is not to be confused with
China’s first historical emperor and seeker of immortality recipes, Qin Shi Huangdi, 259–210 BCE. Taoism built on the ancient legend and magic, yet developed an
elaborate prolongevity system, with many practitioners and many books discussing
the achievement of extreme longevity on Taoist principles (Gruman 1966; Kohn
2001). In this tradition, the main means for attaining extreme longevity was through
consuming special foods, often with salient imaginative magical characteristics.
Gerald Gruman, in his classical work *A History of Ideas About the Prolongation*
*of Life: The Evolution of Prolongevity Hypotheses to 1800* (1966) lists some of
the attributes and properties of foods commonly believed to extend longevity (the
“prolongevity foods”) in Taoist practice (Gruman 1966, p. 44):

These prolongevity foods or “hsien [immortal] medicines” were chosen for a variety of
reasons. Many of the organic products were singled out in accord with the phoenix theme,
that there are plants and animals enjoying a much greater life span than that of man: included
here would be items like tortoise broth, crane eggs, and pine resin. Eggs of all sorts were
valued in line with the Taoist regard for the perfect vitality of the embryo. Peaches were
associated with the fruit in the Western Paradise of Hsi Wang-mu. Great numbers of herbs
and minerals were venerated for such properties as a red color (like cinnabar), a resemblance
to man or an animal (e.g., various roots), a slippery fluidlike texture or a translucent, glowing
appearance. At the top of the list were such valuable minerals as pearls, mica, jade, silver,
gold, and cinnabar.

Most of these properties (e.g. redness, fluidity, glow) were imaginatively associated with vitality, with a greater content of the vital energy “chi,” hence foods
possessing such properties were singled out as longevity foods. The ancient text
entitled “Ts’an T’ung Ch’i” (“The akinness of the three,” c. 142 CE) attributed to the
famous Taoist alchemist and inventor Wei Boyang (Wei Po-Yang), notes the principles for selecting such foods implicitly: “One should make inferences from clues and
signs just as he would from the appearance of strangers he meets. The thing to do is


-----

20 Longevity Foods in Myth, Legend and History 415

to compare things by classes and to trace their beginnings and ends” (Wei Po-Yang
1932, p. 253).
The imaginative inferences are exemplified in the ancient Taoist text *Baopuzi*
(Pao-p’u-tzu) or “The Book of the Master Who Embraces Simplicity” attributed to
the alchemist Ge Hong (Ko Hung, 283–343 CE). In the chapter “The Genie’s Pharmacopoeia,” the book provides an extensive list of longevity foods and medicines,
along with ways of their procurement, including cinnabar, gold, silver, excrescences,
jades, mica, pearls, realgar, brown hematite, quartz, rock crystal, geodes, sulfur, wild
honey, laminar malachite, pine and cypress resins, truffles, yellow dock, liriope, tree
sesame, salomonia, goldthread, fern, mulberries, lycium (box-thorns), etc. etc. (Ware
1966, p. 178). Most of these substances are characterized by the natural properties of
durability that could presumably be transferred to the persons who consume them.
Of special interest is the valorization of mushrooms (“Zhi,” sometimes translated
as “excrescences”) as longevity foods. *Baopuzi* lists several types of the longevity
mushroomsor“excrescences”:“rock,wood,herb,flesh,andthetiny,eachofthemhas
almost a hundred species” (Ware 1966, p. 179). Their potency is said to range from
extending human longevity by hundreds of years to granting potential immortality.
The metaphoric association of substances of such diverse types, commonly designated as “longevity mushrooms,” seems not obvious. Yet presumably their common
signs of durability, etymological or visual similarities, or perhaps some psychoactive
properties, apparent to the imaginative magicians, justified their classification as a
single general category of longevity foods. The magical mental association as a basis
for the longevity food conception was particularly prominent in the Chinese tradition.
But similar instances of association of ideas can be found throughout the world—in
India, Europe, the Americas and elsewhere (Andrews 2000; Simoons 1998; Schultes
et al. 2001).
The element of magical thinking has been persistent and pervasive in the history of
“longevity foods.” This element needs to be recognized, and should not be underestimated. We may rather ask ourselves, whether in our presumably more enlightened
and evidence-based age, the same magical patterns of thought are still not strongly
present. Apparently, large segments of the public still exercise the same type of
magical justifications in their nutritional choices as our distant ancestors. Though
there may be also more modern developments of magical thinking. Thus, marketers
often advertise ‘anti-aging brands’ showcasing robust, successful and happy elderly
consumers of the brands, yet without much actual evidence of the products efficacy.
And yet some parts of the public believe that by partaking of these brands, they
too will become as robust, successful and happy as people in the advertisements.
Is it not yet another case of belief in “contact magic” based on the magical “Law
of Contagion”? And when some parts of the popular-scientific community believe
that life-prolonging effects of certain nutrients as observed in cells or simple model
organisms, have immediate relevance and instructive value for humans—is it not a
case of belief in “imitative magic” based on the magical “Law of Similarity”? And
when some longevity advocates are convinced that by speaking so much more about
longevity research, actual longevity therapies will necessarily arise much faster and


-----

416 I. Stambler

the actual human longevity will become much greater—is it not yet another potential case of “sympathetic” magical thinking, when deeds are believed to be directly
engendered by words? Even such commonplace phrases as “you are what you eat”
may be yet another example of “sympathetic” magical perception, when certain
ostensible attributes are projected on the entire object. Such imaginative magical
thinking may be an inherent part of our human nature, but its presence needs to be
recognized and distinguished from empirical scientific evidence, in order to better
navigate our rational search for truly effective longevity foods.
###### **20.3 Longevity Foods and Religion: The Power** **of Regulation**

Magical thinking is not the only cognitive construct that has been strongly associated with the conceptions of longevity foods. Frazer distinguished magical thinking
from religious thinking, and both from scientific thinking. Magical thinking sought
connections and influences between phenomena in the natural world, even though
those were erroneously deduced by mere imagination. Science also sought connections and influences in the natural world, though based on observation, evidence and
logic. On the other hand, religious ideology has aimed to produce beneficial effects in
our world by propitiating the supernatural realm, by following certain ideations and
practices to attract the favors of deities and the assistance of divine powers, while
avoiding their punishments and repelling their curses. Though, of course, combinations of different modes of thought have often been present, between magic and
religion, but also between magic and science, as well as between science and religion. The connection to religious devotional practices and philosophical ideations
is strongly felt in the religious traditions connected to longevity foods. The lifeprolonging morality and self-control, but also altered states of mind, often feature as
parts of such religious ideations and practices.
There have been many examples of narratives on great longevity, even radical life
extension and immortality, and the dietary practices necessary for their attainment,
in the religious traditions of Sumer, Egypt, Persia, China, Japan, Korea, ancient
Greece and the Roman Empire, in Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, as well
as more modern religious movements (Stambler 2014). Rejuvenation, resurrection
and extreme longevity thanks to special foods are also recurrent themes in the native
myths of North, Central and South America, and in Oceania and Africa. There are
stories, in the vast majority of these native mythological traditions, that humans were
originally immortal, and succumbed to death only because of loss of self-control,
negligence, ill-will or accident (Grimal 1989). Loss of self-control was an especially
fatal human fault responsible for the loss of longevity foods and the resulting loss of
the powers of longevity. Several characteristic examples will be provided further on.
Notably, in these traditions, prolongevity substances, especially plants, are almost
invariably perceived as foods. Insofar as foods were generally vital for the survival,


-----

20 Longevity Foods in Myth, Legend and History 417

logically, also life-prolonging properties were presumed to be present in special kinds
of foods. It may just have been difficult to imagine other means of consumption of
putative longevity remedies. Hence longevity foods are often indistinguishable from
longevity drugs.
Of further note is the fact that many substances associated with longevity were
“entheogenic”—a term commonly denoting psychoactive substances used in religious practices, originating from the Greek words “entheos” (inspired by god) and
“genesthai” (coming into being). Consuming such substances, in the religious practitioners’ mind, enabled their connection to the gods or the godly realm, drew to them
the beneficial divine powers or repelled harmful demonic influences. The connection with the high supernatural realm was often perceived as altered states of mind,
including hallucinations. Or rather, the altered states of mind, such as hallucinations,
were taken as signs of a connection with the higher otherworldly spiritual realm. The
connection to the spiritual realm would hopefully enable the adept to derive from it
special powers, including longevity. Yet, in religious practices, self-control and the
dominion of the mind over the body were even more ubiquitous attributes associated
with the consumption of longevity foods, as will be exemplified shortly. Often the
powers of self-control or mind-over-body control were linked with altered states of
mind, as indeed strong self-control can be considered a rather unusual or “altered”
state of mind.

A clear and rather simple connection between longevity foods, altered states of
mind and religion, can be seen in the ancient native American traditions, from North
America through South America. In these traditions, some of the longevity-granting,
rejuvenating and healing plants included cocoa, cactus, aloe (octli), ayahuasca (caapi
jungle vine), and manioc (Grimal 1989; Andrews 2000; Schultes et al. 2001). Many
of these supposedly life-prolonging plants were also psychoactive (Andrews 2000;
Schultes et al. 2001). That may provide an additional insight into the connection of
physical and mental spheres in the pursuit of longevity. Some of the explanations
for the connection may be that psychoactive plants appeared to provide a conduit
with the spiritual world and with the gods, and thus to help the practitioners draw in
divine powers of vitality from the other world and partake in the vitalities of the gods
they contacted. Though there could be a more mundane explanation, such as that
certain physical sensations (weightlessness, sense of inclusiveness, etc.) induced in
the psychoactive substance users, became associated in their mind with vitality and
longevity. In any case, the connection of the pursuit of longevity with the mental
state is again apparent.
Yet, the mental-physical connection may be even more encompassing, comprising
issues of morality, self-control and social regulation. Thus, an American Indian
legend tells that people would have been immortal had they followed a wise man’s
instructions, and welcomed an old man carrying a basket of rotting flesh, rather than
a pleasant looking young man carrying sweets (Grimal 1989, p. 489). Thus, foolish
indulgence and lack of foresight and discipline, in particular in relation to food,
became the original sins that brought about human mortality. The instructions on the
ethical behavior in relation to food, longevity and mortality, have been elaborated in
virtually every religious tradition.


-----

418 I. Stambler

Thus, one of the earliest representations of rejuvenation and life extension in
relation to foods, as well as one of the earliest known works of literature and religious
instruction, is the Sumero-Babylonian *Epic of Gilgamesh*, a story about the hero’s
struggle with death (the most complete version has been dated from c. 1300 BCE to
650 BCE, but the story possibly originated as early as about 3000 BCE). According
to the *Epic of Gilgamesh* : “There is a plant like a thorn with its root [deep down
in the ocean], Like unto those of the briar (in sooth) its prickles will scratch [thee],
(Yet) if thy hand reach this plant, [thou’lt surely find life (everlasting)]” (Campbell
1928, pp. 55–56, Tablet 11 “The Flood”). The plant has been likened to box-thorn
and dog-rose (Veenker 1981). Gilgamesh initially procures the plant, but then loses it
and with it loses the hope of immortality. Yet, the loss of this particular plant, and of
the immortality it may have conferred, is only an outcome of a more profound human
failing. The primary cause for the loss of immortality was the lack of self-control.
When first tested for his worthiness by the immortal sage Utnapishtim, Gilgamesh
loses the chance of immortality by not being able to exercise enough self-control to
fight his urge to sleep. And then, after procuring the plant of immortality from the
bottom of the ocean, Gilgamesh is not watchful enough and loses it to a serpent. Thus,
the intrinsic human inability of self-restraint prevents further human development
towardamorepowerful,robustandlong-livedbeing.Theplant(foodstuff),regardless
of any empirical qualities, serves to convey the allegory.
There are striking parallels between the description of the immortalizing plant, the
flood and the story of the extremely long-lived Utnapishtim in the epic of *Gilgamesh*
and the biblical stories (with the composition sometimes dated c. 1300 BCE to
450 BCE) about the “tree of life” and about the extreme longevity of antediluvian
patriarchs (Genesis 2:9, 3:22–24, 5:1–32). Notably, the access to the tree of life
was lost due to the lack of discipline of Adam and Eve. Also the great longevity of
antediluvian patriarchs was annulled due to human depravity that brought about the
deluge.
In the ancient cultural traditions, there were many “recipe” type referrals to
longevityfoodsthatdidnotseemtobearadirectrelationtoquestionsofmorality,selfcontrol, mental state or religious precepts. But some indirect relations could nonetheless be inferred, even in those less obvious cases. Thus, in one of the earliest known
Egyptian medical papyruses, “The Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus” (commonly dated
to the period of the New Kingdom of Egypt, c. 1500 BCE), there is a “Recipe for
Transforming an Old Man into a Youth.” The recipe involved the use of bruised and
dried “hemayet-fruit.” Some recent identifications of this remedy vary from fenugreek to almond (Ghalioungui 1973; Jacobs and Hart 2019). The remedy would not
only have a cosmetic anti-aging effect—remove wrinkles, beautify the skin, remove
blemishes, disfigurements, and “all signs of age”—but it would also have a true rejuvenating effect, as it would remove “all weaknesses which are in the flesh” (Breasted
1930, pp. 506–507). Alongside the purely material recipes, the book abounds in
religious incantations designed to ward off evil influences. In yet another ancient
Egyptian medical papyrus, “The Ebers Papyrus” (c. 1500–1600 BCE), there are
described cosmetic anti-aging treatments to prevent the graying of hair (for example
by the use of honey, onion water, donkey liver and crocodile fat), and to stimulate


-----

20 Longevity Foods in Myth, Legend and History 419

hair growth (for example by the use of flaxseed oil, gazelle excrements and snake
fat). Yet, actual treatment of aging as a medical condition was also mentioned: when
a physician examines a person whose “heart is feeble as if the frailty of old age
has overcome him … then say thou: ‘It is an accumulation of morbid juices.’ He
shall not wilfully minimize the danger, nor put his trust in feeble remedies” (Bryan
1930, p. 142). Large portions of the “Ebers Papyrus” are dedicated to combating
diseases due to unhealthy and immoderate eating, such as constipation, that could be
indirectly related to moral instruction (Bryan 1930; Joachim 1890). In this medical
text, invocations of healing gods—Isis, Osiris and Ra—are also a part of preparing
medicines. Another famous instance of the interest in healing and rejuvenation in
ancient Egypt was the lore of Imhotep, the legendary high priest and chief minister
to the pharaoh Djoser, and the reputed builder of the first step pyramid (c. 2650–
2600 BCE). Among other accomplishments, Imhotep was said to be skilled in the
art of rejuvenation and later deified as a god of medicine (Hurry 1926). Thus, the
connection of medical practice with religious instruction can be perceived.
Notably, in ancient Egypt, medicine was largely under the control of the powerful
priesthood who appropriated the responsibility for the physical preservation of the
king and his subjects, as well as for the magical and religious rituals aimed to ensure
the appropriate order of personal, public and environmental affairs. Thus, the religious priestly component of ancient Egyptian medicine was prominent, even though
the functions of a physician, a magician and a priest were not always uniformly
co-exercised by the same practitioners (Ghalioungui 1973). The preservation from
ravishes of old age in this life and the preservation of the physical body as a necessary
condition for the preservation of the soul in the afterlife, may have been parts of the
more general concern with preservation and perpetuation in that culture. In ancient
Egypt, the religion, including its dietary regimens, may have served as a means to
discipline the citizens, to control and regulate the social order. The desire for social
order and preservation may have coalesced with the goals of health and life prolongation. Arguably, the preeminent preoccupation of the Egyptians with immortality
was inseparably linked to their static cosmology, to their obsession with preservation,
balance and constancy in all spheres including the society. Moreover, a case may yet
be made that many of their pioneering technologies, from pyramid construction to
embalming and surgery to prolongevity food recipes and regimens, may have been
at least partly driven by their general desire for individual and social preservation.
Thus, in the Egyptian tradition too, longevity foods could be seen as a part and parcel
of much broader social and ideological frameworks.

Also in Hinduism (or rather in the variety of religions of India designated by this

been persistent themes since a very early time, and have been related to deep social,
ideological and moral foundations. In India, the immortal Rishis, Arhats, and the

Ciranjivas (the “extremely long-lived persons”) have been revered. Their extreme
longevity is often attributed to “Amrit”— ���� —or the “nectar of immortality,” a
revered and desired substance. In the legend (“purana”) of “Churning the Ocean of
Milk,” the different supernatural races—Asuras (“demons”) and Devas (“gods”)—
work together to create this “nectar of immortality” (Lidke and Dirnberger 2009). In
theRigveda,oneoftheearliestknownVediccollectionsofIndia(c.1700–1100BCE),
the entire Book 9 is composed of hymns praising the immortality-giving “Soma”
plant (Griffith 1891). Recent identifications of “Soma” range from fly-agaric, ephedra
and cannabis, to sacred lotus, heather and honey (Flattery and Schwartz 1989). In
the ancient Indian epic of the Ramayana (often dated c. 400 BCE, and sometimes
purported to relate to events occurring 4000 and even 5000 BCE), the monkey king
Hanuman uses the Sanjeevani plant (translated as “One that infuses life”) to revive
Rama’s younger brother Lakshman who was severely wounded by Ravan (Griffith
1895). The life-giving Sanjeevani plant (sometimes spelled “sanjivani”) has been
commonly identified as the lycophyte *Selaginella bryopteris*, growing at the Dunagiri
(also called Dronagiri or Mahodaya) mountain in the Himalayas (Ganeshaiah et al.
2009). As narrated in the “Shiva Purana” legend (c. 800–1000 CE), at the war between
asuras and devas, during the rule of the asura emperor Jalandhara, the asuras were
resuscitated using “mritasanjivani vidya”—the sacred knowledge of revival, which
might involve the use of the Sanjeevani plant, and other components unattainable
to us, such as “drops of water infused with mantras.” In the opposing camp, the
devas too were revived by medicinal herbs brought from the Dronagiri mountain
(Shastri 1970, pp. 870–871). Note that the mythological traditional narratives about
the Amrit and Sanjeevani and the ritualistic formulas of the Soma may have served
social functions: to maintain the social order, to bind the society together through
narrative and ritual, to create and preserve the common historical identity. Thus, once
again, the longevity foods and medicines function as elements of a vast cultural lore.
The traditional Indian medicine of Ayurveda, or “the science of (long) life,” also
has a strong sanction from religion. According to the Ayurveda tradition, the principles of Ayurveda were created by Brahma, and underwent a chain of transmission
among deities, from Brahma to Prajapati to the Ashvins, to Indra, who then taught
this art to Dhanvantari, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu, the protector of life and the
giver of Ayurveda on Earth (Bhishagratna 1907, p. 8). Ayurveda includes a special
field of Rasayana (meaning, in Sanskrit, the path “¯ayana” of essence or juice “rasa”),
which is mainly dedicated to rejuvenation, and mainly utilizes edible remedies or
foodstuffs (e.g. juices, soups, mixed decoctions, pastes and cakes). According to one
of the earliest Ayurvedic texts, *The Sushruta Samhita* (Sushruta’s Compilation of
Knowledge, c. 800–300 BCE, attributed to Sushruta, an alleged disciple of Dhanvantari), life can be normally prolonged to 100 years. Yet, with the use of certain
Rasayana remedies, prepared from certain plants, such as Vidanga-Kalpa and Brahmi
Rasayana, life can be prolonged to 500 or 800 years (Bhishagratna 1911, pp. 518,
525). And the use of the “Soma plant, the lord of all medicinal herbs [24 candidate plants are named, such as Chandramah, Amsuman and Munjavan species], is


-----

followed by rejuvenation of the system of its user and enables him to witness ten thousand summers on earth in the full enjoyment of a new (youthful) body” (Bhishagratna
1911, p. 536).
Of special interest in the text are the instructions for the preparation and application of the Soma elixir and other Rasayana treatments, integrating the physical,
intellectual and moral domains. Mental and spiritual aptitude is considered vital for
the successful treatment. As it is said of the Soma: “The Soma plants are invisible
to the impious or to the ungrateful as well to the unbeliever in the curative virtues
of medicine and to those spiteful to the Brahmanas” (Bhishagratna 1911, p. 538). A
person preparing for the treatment must perform a cleansing, and undergo the treatment with mental clarity and spiritual awareness, including the recital of incantations
(mantras), exercising “a quiet control over the mind” and renouncing “all passions
and anger” (p. 535). Without those components a remedy would not be effective, “as
the application of a dye to a piece of dirty cloth will prove non-effective” (p. 515).
The application of Rasayana foodstuffs must be adjusted with the rest of the diet,
such as “meals without any salts” (p. 520), as well as with the environment, the
season and the general regimen of life. One cannot just consume Rasayana remedies
mindlessly and expect favorable results, insofar as the treatment is “a combination of
medicine and mantra” (p. 527). The physical effects of rejuvenation are necessarily
accompanied by moral and intellectual effects. For example, the use of Svetavalguja
Rasayana “would make the life of its user sinless, and extend it in the full glow of
health and vigour and in the sound enjoyment of a vigorous memory and of all his
intellectual faculties to a hundred green summers” (p. 522). The remedies are to be
applied “in a spirit of self-control, whereby he would be able to acquire longevity”
(p. 527). Thus, moral virtues, especially the virtue of self-control are perceived in
the Ayurveda tradition as integral for the effective longevity nourishment.
The religious devotion and the pursuit of rejuvenation and radical life extension
are also present in another foundational text of Ayurveda, *The Charaka Samhita*
(Charaka’s Compilation of Knowledge, c. 300–100 BCE). Like Sushruta, Charaka
attributes the origins of Ayurveda to the gods. According to the *Charaka Samhita*, the
normal human life-span is 100 years. Yet, the users of an Amalaka Rasayana could
live many hundreds of years and the users of the Amalakayasa Brahma Rasayana
could reach the life-span of 1000 years (Van Loon 2003, p. 446, 455). The great
sages, who grasped perfectly the knowledge of Ayurveda, “attained the highest wellbeing and nonperishable life-span” (Van Loon 2003, p. 107). This Ayurvedic text too
emphasizes the vital importance of the synergy of the body and mind, spirituality
and morality, social order and environmental soundness, for the successful longevity
nourishment, beside the simple listing of nutritional ingredients. As the principle of
synergy is succinctly described in the *Charaka Samhita* : “Thus the person subdued
with malaise, depression, sleep, drowsiness, lassitude, lack of enthusiasm, dyspnea,
incapability in physical and mental activities, loss of memory, intellect and lustre,
becomes resort of illness and thus does not enjoy the normal life-span. Hence, looking
to these defects, one should abstain from all the said unwholesome diet and activities
so that he becomes fit for using the rasayana treatment” (p. 449). And furthermore,

“The formulations meant for providing longevity and alleviating senility and diseases
succeed(only)inpatientshavingpurifiedmindandbodyandcontrolledself”(p.467).
Of course, there may have been a considerable empirical basis for at least some of
the longevity claims of at least some of the Rasayana remedies. Without at least some
minimal shown efficacy, these remedies may have had difficulty surviving in medical
study and practice for hundreds of years, to the present time. This empirical basis
now continues to be evaluated, as many traditional Ayurvedic medicines are currently
practiced and undergo testing and validation processes (Chaudhary et al. 2010). Yet,
it is important to realize that empirical evidence for the efficacy of particular food
ingredients, and of particular methods of their preparation, is not the only component
in the construction of the longevity food traditions, often even not the main one.
Religious and moral motivations for human development and for the maintenance
of social order, the traditional narratives for the construction of personal as well as
ethnic or national identities, the characteristic mental and psychological perceptions,
are also indispensable components for any longevity food recipe.
Buddhism, having originated in India around the sixth century BCE, too had a
strong connection to the pursuit of longevity (Maher 2009), with many common
elements with other traditional Indian sources. Material means, in particular foodstuffs, for rejuvenation and life extension, have been developed and recommended
by Buddhist physicians. But in this tradition too, the simple concoction of the remedy
is only a part of the longevity food conception, other parts are from the social and
mental domains: the ideological motivations, narrative traditions, communal rituals
to maintain social coherence, and the self discipline to create and fulfill personal
development.
In Buddhist tradition, the Great Buddha who grants Longevity is Amit¯abha, the
Buddha of Infinite Light, also known as Amit¯ayus, the Buddha of Infinite Life. Those
who invoke him will reach longevity in this realm, and will be reborn in Amitabha’s
Pure Land or the Land of Bliss (Sukh¯avat¯ı or Dewachen in Tibetan Buddhism)
where they will enjoy virtually unlimited longevity. This pure and egalitarian land of
longevity was created by Amitabha’s avowed devotion and perseverance, through the
adherence to the Buddhist merits, such as faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration,
and wisdom.

In the Pure Land, divine plants grow that have life-sustaining and healing properties. There are mentioned palm trees, lotus trees and “the tree of awakening.”
However, these are not simple foods: they provide sustenance and healing, but not
necessarily through ingestion (Gomez 1996). The mental nourishment, or food as
mental nourishment, is also integral for the overall environment of the Land of Bliss
that permits deathlessness. This is clearly seen as an ideal, a vision toward which a
devotee should strive. The food in the Land of Bliss corresponds to the spiritual and
beautifying nature of that world. Thus, in the treatise Sukh¯avat¯ı-vy¯uha S¯utra (“The
Sutra Displaying the World of Bliss”), it is said that “living beings in the Land of
Bliss do not consume coarse food, or food consumed in lumps or morsels; rather
whatever fare they wish to eat, that exact same dish they visualize in their minds as


-----

already consumed. And thus their body is satisfied, their limbs are satisfied. Furthermore, they do not need to ingest any of this nourishment in order to feel satisfied”
(Gomez 1996, p. 88).
Thus the Buddhist virtue of detachment may be implied, or satisfaction without
addiction. The life-prolonging nutrition is not just moderate (subject to a conscious
act of control of some degree), but the degree of conscious control is complete. No
longer does the food dictate the nourishment to the person, but the person dictates
the nourishment by one’s own wish. With such a high degree of mental control, the
lifespan also becomes unlimited, as the person frees oneself from deadly material
limitations. This interpretation also seems to be supported, in the Sutra, by the parable
of a prisoner who, even though offered “much food and drink of various kinds,
pure and excellent,” would not be able to “relish this food, consume it, or feel any
satisfaction from it” (p. 105). The real benefit and enjoyment from food would accrue
only if the prisoner is released from “the prison,” by implication set free from the
dependence on and addiction to the limiting and damaging environment. Thus a
moral element is strongly implied.
Related to the Indian tradition, in the ancient Iranian (Aryan) religious tradition,
there are remarkable references to great longevity and longevity foods. There are
strong commonalities between these traditions, apparently due to the common IndoEuropean origins. This commonality is exemplified in the similar terms and names of
the gods. Though, curiously, some terms assume rather opposite meanings. Thus, in
the Indian tradition, the “devas” are perceived as benevolent gods, and the “asuras”
are the demons. In contrast, in the Iranian tradition, “ahura” are the gods (cf. the
benevolent gods Aesir in Norse religions), while the “daeva” are evil spirits (Parpola
2015). However, many terms are very similar. Thus, what is called in the Indian
tradition the life-prolonging “Soma” is referred to as “Haoma” in ancient Iranian
(Aryan) religious sources, such as *Avesta,* the sacred text of the Iranian Zoroastrian
religion (c. 1200–200 BCE) (Darmesteter 1883; Flattery and Schwartz 1989). The
Iranian religious tradition also has a strong instructive moral sentiment regarding
longevity. According to the *Avesta*, during the rule of the mythical king Jamshid
(Yima), people knew no disease, aging and death (Darmesteter 1880). The legendary
“cup of Jamshid” that this king possessed was said to be a container for the elixir
of immortality and at the same time a means to reveal the world knowledge and
gain wisdom and truth (Wilson 1999; Bennett 2018; Nematollahi 2018). The cup of
Jamshid can be seen as a precious item in a great treasury of folklore telling of “magic
vessels”—from the Cauldron of Rebirth in Celtic myths to the Holy Chalice (or the
Holy Grail) in Christian legends (Forlong 1883; Matthews 1997). Those vessels
were believed to impart special powers to the entities contained or prepared in them,
especially the powers of revival and life extension, but also required moral worth to
obtain and keep them. Possessing the magic cup was insufficient to keep prolonging
Jamshid’s life indefinitely. According to “The Book of Kings” ( *Shah Nameh* ) by the
Persian poet Ferdowsi (c. 940–1020 CE), Jamshid became proud and his reign of
prosperity and longevity was terminated, and he himself was killed by the demonic
king Zahhak (Zimmern 1883). This story once again emphasized that longevity could

not be just provided by the dishes that are eaten or vessels that contain the foods, but
by the moral attitude of the people.
###### **20.5 Longevity Foods and Ethics: The Power of Balance**

Longevity foods have been incorporated as parts of the codes of moral conduct in
almost every religion. Thus, in the Jewish religious rules of conduct (Halakhah)—
“tumah” (the unholiness, evil or impurity), generally and in connection to foods,
means simply “the negation of life,” hence the prohibition of murder and of bloodshed, and the laws of “tumah ve’taharah” or ritual purity, also in relation to foods
(Berlin 1997). A variety of foods have been recommended for their presumed healing
and life-prolonging properties, as a part of religious teaching in the Bible and the
Talmud (Rosner 1995).
There are, in the Jewish religions tradition, references to longevity foods that are
of a more mythical and mystical nature. For example, in the Jewish oral tradition,
“Luz” (almond) is a very fraught mythical and mystical concept, associated with life
prolongation, even immortality. It denotes the source of resurrection and regeneration, as well as an endocrine gland and a sprout. “Luz” is also the name of the blessed
land of the immortals, sometimes said to be located in the northern area of Israel
(Kohler 1906). The traditional narrative about “Luz” may even foreshadow some
notions of regenerative biotechnology. Thus, Jacob used “Luz” (almond) rods for
“bioengineering,” to change the color of his sheep (Genesis 30:37–39). Moreover,
there is an extensive Jewish oral tradition about the “Etzem Luz”— עצם לוז —the bone

of resurrection, the indestructible part of the human body from which the resurrection
will proceed. The properties of the luz bone could have been tested in experiments, as
for example related in the story of Rabbi Joshua and Emperor Hadrian in the Talmud
(Kohler 1906). The description of the miraculous properties of Almond, as linked
with longevity and regeneration in those stories, is mainly mythical and mystical.
Yet, in other instances of the Jewish religious tradition, there is a strong rationalist attitude toward longevity foods, associated with a clear moral imperative. The
Jewish religious tradition is generally quite supportive of the efforts for life preservation and longevity (Stambler 2017). The principle “ve-chai bahem”— וחי בהם —viz.
the obligation to live by the commandments and not to die by them (Leviticus 18:5)
has been strongly emphasized. In line with this obligation, the great Jewish rationalist religious philosopher and physician Maimonides (1135–1204, Rabbi Mosheh
ben Maimon) posited a rational moral imperative for the prolongation of life. In his
“Responsum on Longevity” Maimonides stated: “It is written: ‘When you build a
new house, you should make a parapet for your roof so that you bring not bloodshed upon your house should any man fall therefrom” [Deut. 22:8]. This phrase
proves that preparing oneself, and adopting precautionary measures—in that one is
careful before undertaking dangerous enterprises—can prevent their occurrence. …
This demonstrates, however, that there is no firmly determined time for death. Moreover, the elimination of harmful things is efficacious in prolonging life, whereas the


-----

20 Longevity Foods in Myth, Legend and History 425

undertaking of dangerous things is the basis for shortening life” (Rosner 1998). This
statement expresses the rational moral imperative for life prolongation. The actual
means for life prolongation were envisioned by Maimonides as maintaining an ideal
nutritional balance in the body, fully replenishing the vital substances expended in
life processes with new necessary nutritional substances. Such a maintenance of the
nutritional balance, according to Maimonides, could in principle prolong life indefinitely (without a definite endpoint of life). In Maimonides’ own words: “For us Jews,
there is no predetermined end point of life. The living being exists as long as replenishment is provided [for that amount of] its substantive moisture [i.e. bodily humors]
thatdissolves”(Rosner 1998).Thustheconceptofnutritionalbalancebecomeslinked
with the principles of ethical conduct, derived from religious teachings. Balance and
moderation are related in Jewish tradition. Thus a dictum attributed to Maimonides

spells out “Health” (“BRIUT” in Hebrew) as an abbreviation of “Restrain anger,
reduce eating, increase movement” (“bolem rogzo, yafhit okhlo, veyagbir tnuato”).
A similar link between religion, ethical instruction and prolongevity nutrition, can
bealsoobservedintheworksofmedievalIslamicandChristianscholarswhocontem
plated the pursuit of longevity. Thus according to the seminal Islamic alchemist Abu
M¯us¯a J¯abir ibn Hayy¯an (also known as Jabir in Arabic and Geber in Latin, c. 721–
815), the prolongation of healthy life may be achieved by a balancing or equilibration
of “elements” (“natures”) in the human body. “This equilibrium once obtained,” he
wrote “they will no longer be subject to change, alteration or modification and neither
they nor their children ever will perish” (Gruman 1966). The preservation of balance
of particular elements (natures or humors) has become the foundational principle for
the scholastic theory of longevity also in the works of medieval Christian philosophers,alchemistsandphysicians,suchastheItaliantheologianandalchemistThomas
Aquinas (1225–1274) whose *Summa Theologica* (1265–1274) includes discussions
of alchemy, health and longevity; the English philosopher and alchemist Roger Bacon
(c. 1219–1292) who treated on longevity in his *Opus Majus* (1266); the German
friar and alchemist Albertus Magnus (1193–1280) who wrote about the prolongation of life in *On Youth and Old Age and On Life and Death* ; the Italian physician
and alchemist Arnaldus de Villa Nova (c. 1240–1311) whose original and translated
medical books such as *Opera Medica Omnia* include the subjects of old age and long
life, and many others (Stambler 2019a). In these and many other religious thinkers,
the virtues of balance, moderation and self-control generally, and the same virtues
exercised in relation to nutrition in particular, were inseparable elements of the moral
religious code of behavior.
The notions of balance, self-control and moderation, almost always went hand
in hand in the religious ethical rules related to longevity foods and life-prolonging
nutrition. Yet, the element of moderation, or self-limitation, appears to be by far
the strongest valorized premise in these rules. According to many of those rules, in
order to extend health and longevity, it does not matter so much what the person
eats, but rather what the person does not eat, or limits oneself in eating. A vast
array of taboo foods have been proposed in various religions, that were seen not just
as spiritually harming, but also health-impairing and life-shortening. For example,
in some cultures—in ancient Egypt, India, Greece and Rome—the eating of beans


-----

426 I. Stambler

was prohibited or discouraged, especially black beans, as they were associated with
the world of the dead or believed to contain the souls of the dead, and thus could
be harmful or polluting for the living. In ancient Egypt, the eating of beans was
prohibited to the priests rather due to their sacredness as symbols of the inseparably
related death and life through resurrection. Yet in other cultures, especially among
native Americans, beans were permitted for consumption and even revered for their
life-giving germinative power (Simoons 1998; Andrews 2000; Ghalioungui 1973).
Paradoxically, often the same observed properties of certain foods were reasons for
their designation either as taboo or medicine. Thus, the strong pungent taste and smell
of garlic and onions, in oral traditions across the Old World, associated them with evil
influences, as being desirable for the demons and offensive for the gods, discouraging
their consumption. Yet in other instances, often in the same parts of the world, those
very same properties of strong pungent smell and taste were believed to repel evil
influences and strengthen the body of the consumer. Accordingly, in those traditions,
garlic and onions were seen as beneficial or medicinal and recommended as foods
or protective amulets. Thus, food recommendations based on magical “association
of ideas” could be quite ambiguous. In China, in the Taoist prolongevity tradition,
any person wishing to achieve great longevity was discouraged from eating “the five
grains” (rice, millet, wheat, oats, and beans) as those cereals were associated with
corruptible earth and believed to nourish “the three worms” or “the three corpses”—
the destructive demonic entities residing in the human body and bringing about early
death (Gruman 1966; Ware 1966). Yet, in other instances, in cultures across the
world, including China, those same cereals were revered as essential staples of life,
originating from benevolent gods (Andrews 2000). In the Americas, some “pseudocereals” like quinoa and amaranth were considered divine and life-prolonging.
Another interesting case of dietary restriction concerns eating plants of the
nightshade family ( *Solanaceae*, commonly containing the alkaloid solanine). These
include plants with obvious intoxicating properties, such as mandrake, henbane,
thorn apple, belladonna (deadly nightshade) and tobacco, but also common foods,
such as eggplants, peppers, tomatoes and potatoes (Schultes et al. 2001; Andrews
2000). Some of the clearly toxic, stupefying and hallucinogenic plants were associated with witchcraft and demonic possession and avoided as foods. Yet also some of
the common foods of this family, especially those brought late to the European diet,
such as potatoes and tomatoes, were at least initially viewed with suspicion, perhaps
as any newcomers might be and perhaps also due to the family association with the
obviously poisonous plants. Curiously, some other intoxicating and psychoactive
plant foods and drinks of other types, such as grape wine, grain beer and honey
mead in Eurasia and ayahuasca brew in America, with their exhilarating, mindaltering properties, were often sanctioned as beneficial and even sacred substances,
and often associated with health and longevity (Schultes et al. 2001; Andrews 2000).
Once again, magical imagination combined with sensory experience may have led
to ambiguous and sometimes contradictory dietary recommendations. Yet, as it can
be seen in almost any case of specific taboo foods, whose consumption was prohibited or limited—the magical imaginary inferences, religious moral prescriptions and
real-life cautionary experiences have been intertwined.


-----

20 Longevity Foods in Myth, Legend and History 427

Beside the restrictions and limitations on specific foods, just moderation as such,
or the limitation in consuming any foods, is probably the most persistent element in
longevity nutrition guides throughout the centuries. Fasting, so common in virtually
any religion, is one of the most prevalent ramifications of dietary moderation. In
various religious traditions, fasting, apart from spiritual purification and connection
with the gods, was also directly associated with physical effects, including longevity,
even extreme longevity. Here again, the power of fast was not seen as due to some
special “physiological mechanism” as we might seek today, but due to special powers
of the devoted mind and communion with the gods that led to the life-prolonging
effects. It may have been assumed that if the person were able to rule over the
constraints of one’s passions, even the passion for food, those passions would no
longer hold sway over the person, and this would enable the person to overcome the
present constraints, including the constraints of a short lifespan.
This line of thought is clearly perceived in Indian mythology. For example,
several asuras were allowed the gift of extreme vitality thanks to their powers of
self-control, austerity and perseverance, including prolonged fasting. Among the
asuras who achieved great vitality by means of austerity were Hiranyakashipu and
Arunasura. The story of Arunasura, as related in the great purana *Srimad Devi Bhaga-*
*vatam* (c. 800–1000 CE) *,* is instructive considering the underlying mindset (Swami
Vijñanananda 1922, pp. 1046–1053):

With a view to conquer the Devas, he [Arunasura] went to the banks of the Ganges in
the Himâlayâs, practised a very hard Tapasyâ [penance], to Brahmâ, taking Him to be the
Protector of the Daityas [an asura race]. First influenced by Tamo G u na [the evil quality of
ignorance], he withheld in his body the five Vâyus [primary breaths] and partook only the
dry leaves and repeated the Gâyatrî Mantra [the universal protective prayer] and practised
austerities. Thus he practised for full ten thousand years. Then for another ten thousand years
the Daitya lived drinking some drops of water only; then for another ten thousand years he
remained by inhaling air only; and then for another ten thousand years he did not take any
thing and thus practised he his wonderful Tapasyâ.

Though Arunasura’s initial wish that he “shall not die” is refused by Brahma as
“an impossibility”—his austerities are nevertheless rewarded by Brahma by the boon
of incredible invulnerability to many causes of death. Arunasura’s death “shall not
be caused by any war, nor by any arms or weapons, nor by any man or any woman,
by any biped or quadruped or any combination of two.” Thus, through the power of
self-control, particularly fasting, Arunasura advances greatly in his quest to conquer
death. But alas, deathlessness is “an impossibility.” Hence he is eventually killed
by the contrivance of the devas via the pestilence of insects. The allegory is deep,
suggesting the ultimate vulnerability and fallibility of sentient living beings, but also
implying that the struggle for great vitality and longevity is not futile and the gift
of vitality may be awarded for perseverance, self-control and self-denial. This is the
power of ‘extreme moderation’ believed to be necessary for extreme longevity, as
paradoxical as the notion may seem.

###### **20.6 Longevity Foods and History: The Power** **of Moderation**

In various forms and expressions, the need for moderation, particularly moderation
in diet, has remained the absolute consensus among the seekers of extended longevity
for centuries (Shapin and Martyn 2000). Almost as invariably, the recommendation
of moderation was woven into a fabric of moral instruction for the most beneficial
behavior, for the individual as well as for the society.
One of the earliest emphatic instances of this stance can be found in the words of
Lao-Tse, the great legendary teacher of Taoism (c. sixth century BCE), in his treatise
*Tao Te Ching* (Lao-Tse 1891, Chap. 59 “Guarding the Tao,” pp. 102–103):

For regulating the human in our constitution and rendering the proper service to the heavenly,
there is nothing like moderation. It is only by this moderation that there is effected an early
return (to man’s normal state). That early return is what I call the repeated accumulation of
the attributes (of the Tao). With that repeated accumulation of those attributes, there comes
the subjugation (of every obstacle to such return). Of this subjugation we know not what
shall be the limit; and when one knows not what the limit shall be, he may be the ruler of a
state. He who possesses the mother of the state may continue long. His case is like that (of
the plant) of which we say that its roots are deep and its flower stalks firm:—this is the way
to secure that its enduring life shall long be seen.

The consensus about the importance of moderation has existed in the East
and in the West. Thus, one of the founding figures of Western medicine,
Hippocrates (c. 460–370 BCE) gave prescriptions for healthy longevity, such as
“exertion, food, drink, sleep, sexual activity, in moderation” (Smith 1994, p. 263).
Aristotle (384–322 BCE) advised on the need for moderation to preserve health
in old age, for example in his treatises *On Length and Shortness of Life* and *On*
*Youth, Old Age, Life and Death, and Respiration* (Barnes 1984) *.* Also Cicero (106–
43 BCE), in *On Old Age* ( *De Senectute* ), advised that “we must look after our health,
use moderate exercise, take just enough food and drink to recruit, but not to overload, our strength” (Cicero 1900, p. 59). Generally, moderation in food had been a
central tenet of the art of “gerocomia” (“gerocomica” or “gerontocomia” from the
Greek “care for the aged”) since the writing of the Greco-Roman physician Galen
(Aelius/Claudius Galenus, c. 129–217 CE). These principles were stated in Galen’s
book *De tuenda Sanitate. Gerontocomia* (5 [th] book *On the Preservation of Health.*
*Gerontocomia* ) (Galen 1725). This tradition continued for centuries to come.
In the European works on gerocomia, throughout the Middle Ages to the early
modern period, the recommendation on dietary moderation was commonly a part
of the more general moral instruction in Christian humility and moderation. Indeed,
in the Christian tradition, “the seven deadly sins,” i.e. qualities that literally cause
death—pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, anger, and sloth—have excess as their
common basis. The avoidance of the sins corresponds to the moral and spiritual
pursuit of longevity. With moderation, the corresponding “seven heavenly virtues”
or “goods” can be attained—humility, liberality, chastity, kindness, abstinence,
patience, diligence—that can be life-prolonging. As discussed by Thomas Aquinas
in his fundamental work on Christian theology, *Summa Theologica* (1265–1274), the


-----

20 Longevity Foods in Myth, Legend and History 429

vices (e.g. pride, gluttony, lust, greed) are simply goods in excess (honor, appetite,
sexual intercourse, riches) (Aquinas 1920, Summa Theologica, 2:1, Question 84,
Article 4). Thomas Aquinas generally was keenly interested in longevity, as a
concomitant of moral living. As he stated: “in the state of innocence man would
have been immortal” (Summa Theologica, 1, Question 97, Article 1) and “Death
and other bodily defects are the result of sin” (2:1, Question 85, Articles 5–6). As
moderation in food was seen as necessary for longevity, the complete avoidance of
food, in the state of absolute purity, would be tantamount to immortality. In Aquinas’
words: “It would seem that in the state of innocence man did not require food. For
food is necessary for man to restore what he has lost. But Adam’s body suffered
no loss, as being incorruptible. Therefore he had no need of food” (2:1, Question
97, Article 3). Aquinas also proposed practical spiritual prescriptions for longevity,
such as honoring one’s parents (2:2, Question 122, Article 5). Thus, the instruction
on moderation, especially as regards the avoidance of the deadly sin of gluttony, has
been a part of the general Christian ethics and theology.
The connection between moderation in food and religious ethics appears as a
dominant motif in the available European works on longevity through the early
modern period and later. A prominent example is the book by the Flemish priest
Leonardus Lessius (1554–1623) entitled *Treatise of Health and Long Life* ( *Hygias-*
*ticon*, first published in 1613) positing the rules of moderate living (Lessius 1743).
Notably, however, it has never been agreed what exactly a “moderate” measure is
and how it is to be determined. Akin to the general religious doctrines that admitted
of multiple interpretations, also the idea of moderation allowed a vast space for
interpretation and controversy. Some rules of thumb for a correct “moderate” diet
were sometimes proposed. Thus, for example, Lessius’ “Seven Rules for the better
Discovery of this right Measure” posited that the meals should be less than would
render the person “incapable or unfit for his mental employments.” The meals taken
should not produce “dullness or heaviness of disposition.” If changing the diet, “it
is to be done cautiously and by Degrees.” “For those, who are much advanced in
Years, and for those also, that are of weak complexions, twelve or fourteen Ounces of
Food a-Day are judged sufficient.” Any type of food may be good in small measure:
“Any Sort of Food that is common to one suits agreeably enough with hale Constitutions, if so be not too much of it be taken at one Time.” The diet must be simple
and uniform: “Every man should above all Things forbear Variety of Dishes, and
the luxurious Artfulness of Cookery.” Finally, appetites should not be excessively
aroused by the “Fancy of Imagination” (Lessius 1743, pp. 14–32). These rules are
instructive, as even now, as 400 years ago, our concepts of moderation still largely
rely on intuitions and subjective sensations, rather than precise measurements. They
are also instructive in that they again emphasize that the mental state and perception
are integral for any notion of longevity nutrition.
Despite the uncertainties regarding the exact “moderate” measure, the importance
of moderation in diet, of consuming less than people usually do, has been emphasized
by many Western authors writing about longevity throughout the Middle Ages and
the early modern period. These include the Italian professor Gabriele Zerbi (1445–
1505) who wrote a definitive work on Gerocomia, entitled *Gerontocomia, scilicet*


-----

430 I. Stambler

*de senium cura atque victu* (1489, “Gerontocomia, or, care and nutrition for old
age,” written in Rome upon the request of Pope Innocent VIII, 1432–1492). Another
stalwart of this tradition was the Italian long-lived writer Luigi Cornaro (1467–1566)
whowrotethemassivelypopular *Discorsosullavitasobria* (Discourseonasoberlife,
first published in 1566) (Cornaro 1743). Also the German physician Johann Heinrich
Cohausen (1665–1750), in his famous prolongevity work *Hermippus Redivivus or*
*the Sage’s Triumph over Old Age and the Grave* (1742) argued that the “title to long
life” is given by “temperance” (Cohausen 1744, p. 54). Many more examples of this
tradition can be cited (Grmek 1958; Stambler 2019b).
The emphasis on moderation strongly influenced the ideology and practice of
early modern hygienists who strove to extend longevity and preserve health in old
age. Perhaps the most notable in this hygienic tradition was Christoph Wilhelm
Hufeland (1762–1836), the renowned German hygienist, physician to the King of
Prussia Friedrich Wilhelm III, and to Goethe and Schiller. In his book *Macrobiotics*
*or the Art of Prolonging Human Life* (1796), Hufeland coined a particular term for
the pursuit of healthy longevity—“macrobiotics” which has survived to the present
(Wilson 1854). Hufeland specifically distinguished the art of longevity extension
from the general medical art that commonly aims to treat individual diseases and
symptoms and mainly considers short term effects. Hufeland asserted that the aim
of macrobiotics is more long-term and holistic. As he wrote: “The object of medical
art is health; that of the macrobiotic, long life. The means employed in the medical
art are regulated according to the present state of the body and its variations; those
of the macrobiotic, by general principles” (Wilson 1854, pp. vii–viii). Some of the
general principles that determine human longevity, according to Hufeland, include:
“the innate quantity of vital power,” “firmness of organization of the vital organs,”
and the rates of “consumption” vs. “renovation” (“restoration” or “regeneration”)
of the vital force and of the organs (Wilson 1854, p. 40). Moderation, in Hufeland,
is an absolutely crucial means for the conservation of vital power. “Strengthening,
carried too far,” he wrote “may tend to accelerate life, and consequently, to shorten
its duration” (Wilson 1854, p. viii). Moreover, “the more intensively a being lives,
the more will its life lose its extension” (Wilson 1854, p. 42).
Similar principles were professed by several European hygienists of the eighteenth century, such as the German-Latvian proponent of healthy longevity, Johann
Bernhard Fischer (1685–1772), who served as “Archiatrus” (head of the ministry of
medicine) of the Russian Empire and authored the book *On Old Age, its Degrees and*
*Diseases* ( *DeSenior EiusqueGradibus et Morbis,* first publishedin1754, republished
in 1760). In turn, the traditions of longevity hygiene of the eighteenth century formed
the basis for the emergence of “Medicine for the aged” ( *médecine de vieillards)* in
France in the nineteenth century, and “Geriatrics” in the early twentieth century in
the US (Grmek 1958; Stambler 2019b). In virtually all the works related to aging
discussed so far, there has been expressed a strong urge for dietary moderation as a
part of a prudent and ethical living.
Until the nineteenth century, perhaps one of the very few dissenters from this
consensus about the need for moderation was the renowned French lawyer, physician
and gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin (1755–1826). In his *Physiologie du*


-----

20 Longevity Foods in Myth, Legend and History 431

*goût* ( *The Physiology of Taste*, first published in 1825), Brillat-Savarin spoke of the
“Longevity of Gourmands” and praised nutritional abundance (Brillat-Savarin 1854,
pp. 194–196):

I am happy, I cannot be more so, to inform my readers that good cheer is far from being
injurious, and that all things being equal, gourmands live longer than other people. This was
proved by a scientific dissertation recently read at the academy, by Doctor Villermet [the
hygienist Louis René Villermé, 1782–1863]. … Those who indulge in good cheer, are rarely,
or never sick. … as all portions of their organization are better sustained, nature has more
resources, and the body incomparably resists destruction.

In the longevity food culture up to the beginning of the twentieth century, that
would be a rare exception that would celebrate hedonistic enjoyment, abundance
and diversity of foods, rather than limitation and self-denial. Historically, in the
older period, well until the beginning of the twentieth century, the vast majority of
the authors rather valorized moderation and austerity in food consumption. It may
be interesting to observe whether and to which extent the valorization of moderation
was gradually superseded or supplemented by valorization of enjoyment, abundance
and diversity of consumption as a means toward healthy longevity, in the more recent
period. The evolution of ideas about longevity foods in the later modern period would
require a more thorough investigation, beyond the scope of this work that focuses
on the older magical, mythological, religious and historical traditions, and should
rather not encroach into the territory of more up-to-date reviews. The question of
evidence regarding the actual longevity benefits of limited vs. unlimited consumption
is also beyond the scope of this work. The main argument of this work remains that,
historically, the conception of longevity foods has not been a purely scientific one,
but also a psychological, social and meta-scientific construct, involving questions of
social good and ethical personal conduct.
###### **20.7 Conclusion: The Need to Promote Longevity** **Nourishment in Social Context**

As I have argued, beside purely scientific and evidential elements, the discourse on
longevity foods has historically comprised a vast range of accompanying elements,
from the social and mental domains, including cultural, educational, ethical, philosophical and religious aspects. The inclusion of such aspects into the discussion
of longevity foods has created rich and colorful contexts, often involving quite
fateful behaviors, movements, passions, special interests and conflicts. A more thorough elaboration of those contexts and conflicts would also go beyond the presently
feasible scope.
As humorously noted by a mid-twentieth century German physician and longevity
popularizer Gerhard Venzmer (Venzmer 1937, p. 127, my translation):

Unfortunately, one cannot write about nutrition without making some part of humanity his
bitter enemies. A fanatic of a ‘correct nutrition’ makes no concessions, for him ‘his’ way of


-----

432 I. Stambler

nutrition is the only right one, and whoever thinks otherwise is an idiot, and possibly also
a ‘traitor to national health’ or a ‘paid agent of certain industries’. … It is a shame how
the fanatics of particular forms of diet, with every bite they take, constantly worry whether
the food they consume is the ‘right one.’ They eventually feed themselves so ‘healthy’ that,
through sheer anxiety, they cannot enjoy the ‘health’ that they buy so dearly.

Indeed, far from being a set of straightforward recipes detailing the lists
of the correct foodstuffs that need to be consumed, their amounts and preparation procedures, longevity foods have often functioned as social actors,
rallying points, slogans and advertisements, signs and symbols of individual and
communal identity, directives for the personal and social rules of conduct. They
involved not just “psychological-somatic” aspects, but much more encompassing
“psychological-ideological-cognitive-social-economic-environmental-somatic” and
many more integrally interrelated aspects. The concepts of longevity foods were
adjusted to diverse social and ideological outlooks, depending on particular contexts
and environments. It is important, for a thorough presentation of the subject, to
consider longevity foods in such a rich multi-disciplinary context and promote a
multi-disciplinary discussion. The present work, even though only initiatory and
incomplete, has aimed to stimulate such a multi-disciplinary discourse.
Such a multi-faceted consideration may have practical implications, also in terms
of health research and public health. A multi-disciplinary discourse may eventually
contribute to a stronger scientific evidence for the effects of specific longevity foods,
to their more efficient research, development and utilization. Thus, it may be often
beneficial to distinguish actual scientific evidence for a particular longevity food,
from the magical thinking that may be involved in its promulgation. Yet, in order to
enable this distinction, it is important to recognize that there could be an element of
magical thinking. Also to discern scientific evidence among special social and ideological interests, it is important to realize that there may be such social and ideological
interests, not necessarily related to science. On the positive side, it may be important
to empower individuals and the society, to engage social, psychological and cognitive
resources that may be determinative for the effective development and beneficial and
universal utilization of longevity foods. For that purpose, a better understanding of
those multi-domain human resources and determinants is required. It is hoped that
the present work will contribute to such a multi-disciplinary understanding, and thus
to a more thorough engagement of the human capacity for the benefit of providing
health and life-prolonging nourishment for all.

##### **Chapter 21**
#### **Nutritional Regulation of Aging** **and Longevity**

**Alexey Moskalev**

**Abstract** Nutrition (diet composition and eating regimen) is one of the key factors
of longevity. A balanced diet allows you to avoid essential nutrient deficiencies
and hazardous substances to metabolic health. A healthy diet, containing enough
dietary fibers, polyphenols, and metabiotics, maintains an optimal quantitative and
qualitative balance of the microbiota. Aging is a complex of chronic inflammation
and stress processes, so anti-inflammatory nutrients, antimutagens, and hormetins
are an integral part of a longevity diet. One of the factors of inflammation is a
hyperglycemic diet. Controlling the levels of simple carbohydrates (glucose, fructose, galactose) in the diet can reduce the level of glycation in tissues, which is
a fundamental mechanism of aging. Several biologically active substances in food
are capable of targeted suppression of aging-associated signaling pathways and activating pro-longevity stress-resistance. Diet personalization is the future of preventive
medicine, taking into account markers of metabolic health, the nutritional density of
the diet, and markers of biological age.

###### **21.1 Introduction**

Nutrition is an important determinant of longevity and the risks of age-related
diseases. In the 2018 Global Nutritional Quality Report noted that malnutrition
is a major risk factor for illness and death, more severe than air pollution or
tobacco smoking (see: https://globalnutritionreport.org/reports/global-nutrition-rep
ort-2018). Studies carried out in the United States, the population of which, on
the one hand, is the most studied, and on the other hand, for the most part does
not adhere to the principles of healthy eating, show that a healthy lifestyle adds
12–14 years to lifespan (Li et al. 2018). A balanced diet offers more promise in A. Moskalev ( B )

terms of prolonging life than dietary supplements or pharmaceuticals. For example,
unlike complex polyphenols, individual substances such as resveratrol, tocopherol,
polyphenol-containing grape skin extract, antioxidant SkQ1, and metformin do not
lead to any differences between the lifespan of control and experimental SHR mice
(Panchenko et al. 2019).
Analysis of data on the composition of 1000 raw foods, made it possible to identify
foodstuff with the most beneficial combination of useful nutrients (Kim et al. 2015).
Based on this paper, a Nutritional score, and a list of the 100 “healthiest” foods
were created (see: http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180126-the-100-most-nutrit
ious-foods). The top “superfoods” for example include almonds, cherimoya fruit, fish
(sea bass, flounder), chia and pumpkin seeds, Swiss chard, celery and parsley, lard.
Potentially unhealthy foods include those with an excess of simple carbohydrates
(Seidelmann et al. 2018), animal proteins (Song et al. 2016; Virtanen et al. 2019),
highly processed (Rico-Campa et al. 2019), fried (Sun 2019), salty (Khan et al.
2019) food, as well as fast food and sugary drinks (Barrington and White 2016), that
increase the mortality.
In addition to the mortality risks associated with nutrition, it is of great interest
to study the effect of diet on biological age. According to the most accurate method
to date for measuring biological age and mortality risks by DNA methylation, the
calculated parameter AgeAccelGrim is closely related to nutritional quality. Healthy
diet contributes to slower aging on this parameter (Lu et al. 2019). It is important to
note that a healthy diet determines not only the duration, but also the quality of life.
People who follow a healthy diet are not only much healthier but much less likely
to show signs of depressed mood and chronic depression than people who eat junk
food (Firth et al. 2019).
###### **21.2 Principles of a Diet That Promote Healthy Longevity**

There are 7 basic principles of a diet that could promote healthy longevity. ***21.2.1 Balanced Nutrition***

It is important to have a balanced diet. Essential amino acids and fatty acids, “complex” carbohydrates, soluble and insoluble dietary fiber, minerals and vitamins,
biologically active substances (terpenes, carotenoids, polyphenols) are unevenly
distributed among different food products. Therefore, food should be as varied as
possible, according to the principle of “all just a little bit”. Refined foods (white flour,
white rice, sugar, refined vegetable oil) that are low in nutritional value and have an
excess of calories should be avoided.

21 Nutritional Regulation of Aging and Longevity 441

**21.2.1.1** **Proteins**

Proteins, especially those containing 8 essential proteinogenic amino acids (tryptophan, valine, threonine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, phenylalanine, methionine), are
the most important component of the diet. However, excess protein food can create
additional risks at certain age periods of life. It was found a relationship between
protein intake and mortality in different age groups (Levine et al. 2014). According
to the same study, elevated protein intake (20% of the average intake of 1,823 cal per
day) at the age of 50–65 leads to a 75% increase in overall mortality and a fourfold
increase in cancer deaths over the next 18 years. However, the same protein intake
(20%) over the age of 65 leads to fewer cancer deaths. It is worth noting a fivefold
increase in mortality from diabetes mellitus at any age with increased protein intake.
In a meta-analysis of 31 prospective cohort studies, normal total protein intake was
associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality, especially if the most of this was
from plant sources (Naghshi 2020). An additional 3% of energy from plant proteins
per day was associated with a 5% reduction in the risk of all-cause death. At the
same time, some authors question such conclusions, pointing out the concomitant
consumption of other useful biologically active substances, such as dietary fibers
and phytonutrients (Chalvon-Demersay et al. 2017). Animal protein may not be
overly harmful, but simply be accompanied by additional amounts of potentially
detrimental substances: for example, heme iron as an oxidant in red meat, carnitine
and choline from meat and eggs (converted by intestinal bacteria into TMA and
then to atherogenic TMAO the liver), pro-inflammatory Omega-6 arachidonic acid.
Processed meat contains exessive salt and fats, as well as carcinogenic compounds:
heterocyclic amines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and N-nitroso compounds
(Song et al. 2016).
Despite the need for essential amino acids, it excessive consumption carries
certain health risks. On the one hand, essential amino acids such as branched-chain
amino acids BCAA (valine, isoleucine, valine) and methionine play a protective
role against liver fibrosis and sarcopenia. At the same time, their excess in the
diet contributes to the risk of metabolic syndrome: hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
obesity, atherosclerosis, thrombosis, autoimmune diseases. Elevated BCAAs are
associated with obesity, insulin resistance and decreased lifespan in mice (Solon-Biet
et al. 2019). Decreased consumption of BCAA restored of metabolic health in obese
mice (Cummings et al. 2018). In a human subject with ≥7% weight gain at followup, dietary BCAA intake was associated with a higher risk of metabolic syndrome
(MetS) (Hosseinpour-Niazi 2020). It is worth noting as one of the promising interventions to prevent excess BCAA that cold hardening and the brown adipose tissue
that develops thereby promote the removal of BCAA from the bloodstream through
their utilization as an energy substrate in mitochondria (Yoneshiro et al. 2019).
As for methionine, its long-term dietary restriction (MR) to the required minimum
increased the lifespan of mice (Miller et al. 2005) and rats (Orentreich et al. 1993).
Short-term MR improves metabolic health in the mice (Yu et al. 2018). In mice
MR produced more substantial effects than BCAA leucine restriction (LR) on the
body mass and glucose homeostasis and reduced hepatic lipogenic gene expression,

which was absent with the LR diet (Lees et al. 2017). Dietary restriction of the
essential amino acid methionine, the reduction of which has anti-aging and antiobesity properties, affects cancer outcome through reproducible changes in onecarbon metabolism (Gao et al. 2019).
In a mouse model, a decrease in protein and amino acid intake, including BCAA
and methionine, contributed to an increase in the levels of the metabolic hormone
FGF21, a sensor of amino acids GCN2 kinase, an improvement in metabolic parameters, and a decrease in mTOR activity (Green and Lamming 2019). Furthermore,
diets with lower levels of sulfur-containing amino acids (SAA) (close to the minimum
recommended levels) are associated with a reduced risk of cardiometabolic disease
(Dang 2020).AlowSAAdietusesplant-basedproteinsourcesratherthanmeat-based
foods.

**21.2.1.2** **Lipids**

Saturated fat should not be the main source of the diet. For example, a high fat
diet alters the activity of intestinal IgA+ immune cells in mice (Luck et al. 2019). IgA
is an essential link that controls intestinal and adipose tissue inflammation, intestinal
permeability, microbial invasion, and the composition of the gut microbiome. In
addition, specialized enteroendocrine (EEC) cells in the gut are known to recognize
nutrients and send endocrine signals to the brain. If you eat exclusively fatty foods,
the intestinal microflora changes and EEC cells are turned off due to the stress of the
endoplasmic reticulum that has arisen in them, which blocks the normal exchange
of signals between the intestine and the brain (Ye et al. 2019). A fatty diet promoted
the proliferation of Acinetobacter bacteria, which caused the EEC to be silenced
(Ye et al. 2019). In this regard, it is skeptical to use a high-fat keto diet without any
therapeutic indications.
Cholesterol is contained in the membranes of all animal cells, participates in the
synthesis of steroid hormones, is necessary for the synthesis of bile acids and vitamins
of group D (under the influence of sunlight in the skin), protects erythrocytes from
destruction. However, elevated total blood cholesterol levels are related to morbidity
and mortality from coronary heart disease in middle-aged men (Tomas Abadal et al.
2001). Regular consumption of red meat, fatty dairy products, and eggs increases the
risk of colon cancer (Wang et al. 2018). Cholesterol itself is a tumorigenic factor that
stimulates the proliferation of intestinal stem cells. Regular red meat consumption
also elevates the risk of ischemic heart disease and diabetes (Papier et al. 2021).
However, moderate consumption of animal fats did not increase the risk of coronary heart disease (Chowdhury et al. 2014). In seniors over 85, high cholesterol
in the blood was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease or

death (Weverling-Rijnsburger et al. 1997). Probably, without systemic inflammatory
processes, cholesterol in the bloodstream is not dangerous for blood vessels, however,
it’s very excessive consumption can have negative consequences.
Monounsaturated fatty acids have sufficient fluidity (due to the presence of one
double bond in the molecule), but at the same time less oxidizability compared to

polyunsaturated ones with two bonds. Also, monounsaturated fatty acids predominate in the membranes of long-lived lines of model animals (Han et al. 2017). In addition,extravirginoliveoil,firstcoldpressed,containsawholerangeofsubstanceswith
potential geroprotective effects - oleic acid, hydroxytyrosol, oleocanthal, oleanolic
and olive acids, erythrodiol, beta-sitosterol, vitamins E and K1. Extra virgin olive
oil can be considered as an antidepressant and tranquilizer, affecting the monoaminergic and endocanabioid systems (Han et al. 2017; Perveen 2013). Olive oil in mice
improved cognitive function and inhibited neurodegeneration (Lauretti et al. 2017).
It has an anti-mutagenic effect (Aly et al. 2018). Olive oil extended lifespan in a rat
model (Baati et al. 2012). Finally, plant-based monounsaturated fats are associated
with lower mortality in humans (Guasch-Ferre et al. 2019). Twelve weeks of a plantbased MUFA diet reduces liver fat and improves liver and overall insulin sensitivity
(Errazuriz et al. 2017).
In contrast, polyunsaturated omega-6 are highly oxidizable molecules, and their
oxidation products are cytotoxic (Iuchi et al. 2019) and cancerogenic (Bartsch et al.
1999). Omega-6 source rapeseed oil in large quantities may increase the risk of
neurodegenerative disorders (Lauretti et al. 2017). However, it’s important to note
that essential omega-6 linoleic acid has long-term benefits for the prevention of type
2 diabetes (Fan et al. 2017) and risks of overall and cardiovascular mortality in men
(Virtanen et al. 2018).
A study of the effect of the lifetime consumption of various sources of fats rich
in monounsaturated (olive oil), omega-6 polyunsaturated (sunflower oil) or omega-3
polyunsaturated fatty acids (fish oil) on liver aging in male Wistar rats showed that
extra virgin olive oil led to the lowest oxidative and ultrastructural changes in the
liver. Sunflower oil caused fibrosis, ultrastructural changes, and oxidative processes.
Fish oil increased age-related oxidation decreased the activity of the mitochondrial
electron transport chain but increased the relative telomere length. Age-related gene
expression changes in animals fed extra virgin olive oil and fish oil were mainly
associated with mitochondrial function and oxidative stress pathways, followed by
control of the cell cycle and telomere length. Thus, extra virgin olive oil can be
considered a source of dietary fat that provide better protection to the liver during the
aging process (Varela-Lopez et al. 2018). While olive oil (without heat treatment)
should be consumed in a tablespoon every day, it is better to get the omega-3 available
to the body from 2 servings of fatty fish per week, and omega-6 - in the form of a
handful of fresh nuts and a pinch of seeds (sesame, linseed) per day.
Undoubtedly, some omega-3 and omega-6 are essential, in fact, vitamins that our
body needs in small quantities. Even though omega-6 are generally considered to be
pro-inflammatory, they include the essential fatty acid linoleic acid, which is essential
for regular consumption. It is found mainly in vegetable oils. Among the omega-3s,
eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids, found in seafood, are essential. Thus,
it is important to consume both omega-3 and omega-6, the only question is to achieve
their optimal ratio in the diet 1:3 or even better 1:1.
Modern epidemiological studies essentially clarify the existing paradigm. On
the one hand, consumption of trans fatty acids, animal MUFAs, some PUFAs (αlinolenic acid and arachidonic acid) is associated with higher mortality; on the other

hand, dietary intake of marine omega-3 PUFAs and replacement of PUFAs with
plant MUFAs or linoleic acid were associated with lower overall and cardiovascular
mortality (Zhuang et al. 2019).
Regarding the fat composition of the diet, it is worth mentioning that it should not
be used ready-made commercial food, since the margarine contained in it includes
trans fats that can cause cytotoxic stress of the endoplasmic reticulum (Oteng
and Kersten 2020). Deodorized (hot steam treated) oils contain toxic contaminants
glycidyl ethers (Shimamura 2020). In addition, products of animal origin must be
purchased fresh, since during long-term storage, even in a frozen state, oxysterols
accumulate in them, which accelerate atherogenic changes in the vessels (Vejux
2020).

**21.2.1.3** **Carbohydrates**

The Glycemic Index (GI) is a scale that measures how quickly specific foods release
glucose into the bloodstream. Depending on the GI, carbohydrates are usually
divided into undesirable “refined” or “fast” and beneficial “slow” or “complex”.
Fast foods include glucose, sucrose, amylopectin, fructose, lactose, and galactose.
They are also found in added sugars, starchy vegetables, pasta, breads, sweets,
whole milk, honey, and fruits. “Slow-release carbohydrates” - in whole grains,
legumes, non-starchy vegetables. The product’s GI should preferably not exceed
an average threshold of 70. Low-GI diets in patients with impaired glucose tolerance
or diabetes were effective at reducing glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting glucose,
BMI, total cholesterol, and LDL (Zafar et al. 2019). Compared to diets providing
a high glycemic index, low glycemic index protocols resulted in significantly more
pronounced decreases in serum triglycerides and HOMA-index (Schwingshackl et al.
2015). On the contrary, high GI was associated with increased risks of colorectal,
bladder and kidney cancers (Turati 2019).
Dietary simple sugars alter microbial ecology in the gut and promote colitis in
mice (Khan 2020). In addition to GI, it is worth considering the glycemic load the amount of available carbohydrates in the product. This value should not exceed
[20 (see: https://www.diabetes.co.uk/diet/glycemic-load.html). Thus, GI is correlated](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/diet/glycemic-load.html)
with the best indicators of metabolic health markers. However, the evidence for
the association of GI with endpoints such as disease is rather limited. It cannot
be concluded that a diet high in carbohydrates or an increase in the percentage of
total energy intake in the form of carbohydrates increases the likelihood of obesity
(Sartorius 2018). In this connection other measures of dietary quality, such as fiber
may be more likely to predict health outcomes (Vega-Lopez et al. 2018).
However, fiber should be consumed in whole foods rather than supplements. Even
relatively short periods of inulin supplementation in mice with intact gut microbiome
adversely affect liver metabolism and function (Pauly 2020). Raw vegetables and
fruits not only carry prebiotics (fibers, fructans, pectins) to feed our microflora, they
are the main source of this microflora (live bacteria, viruses, fungi) in our intestines,
that is, a probiotic (Wassermann et al. 2019).

21 Nutritional Regulation of Aging and Longevity 445

In terms of macronutrients, a balanced diet might look like this. 10–12% of the
average daily calorie intake can come from proteins, mostly plant (legumes twice a
week; whole grain cereals from sorghum, amaranth, canihua, quinoa, oats, barley,
buckwheat; seeds in vegetable salads; nuts for a snack), but every day and something from sources of animal proteins - for example, once a week, shrimp, scallops,
poultry meat, a piece of goat or sheep cheese, a couple of eggs, alternating each time.
Approximately 55% of calories are from carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are whole
grain cereals, boiled sweet potatoes, as well as vegetables (beets, carrots, eggplants,
zucchini, various types of cabbage) and fruits. Bread, desserts, sugary drinks, pasta
and potatoes should be avoided, as these are quickly digestible carbohydrates that
sharply and for a long time increase blood sugar levels (they have a high glycemic
index and glycemic load). The remaining 35% of calories are fats, mostly monounsaturated (from olive oil, almonds and avocado), but also polyunsaturated (from fish,
seafood, flaxseed oil, seeds, and nuts), and saturated - about a tablespoon of butter
in a side dish.
###### ***21.2.2 Prebiotics and Metabiotics***

Human is a “superorganism”, a consortium of numerous living things from different
kingdoms - fungi, protozoa, bacteria, archaea, and viruses. In the first years of life,
a complex community of microorganisms is formed in our colon, to which immune
tolerance is formed. Its basic composition does not change very much during the life.
That is why taking antibiotics can provoke risks, for example, of diabetes (Mikkelsen
et al. 2015). Imbalance in the composition and quantity of intestinal microflora
also increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases, inflammation (in the intestine and
systemic), neurodegeneration and carcinogenesis.
The invasion of foreign strains of even beneficial bacterial species can lead to
inflammatory reactions or their penetration beyond the intestinal barrier into the
tissues of our body. For this reason, it should not be necessary recommend taking
probiotics (cultures of living bacteria) in the form of dietary supplements or overly
enriched products. The usefulness of such an intervention in the delicate ecological
balance of our microbial communities has not been adequately confirmed - moreover,
afterprolongedperiodsofusingprobiotics,harmfulconsequencesmayappear(Shenderov 2013). However, there are indications for the use of probiotics, for example
asthma, cystic fibrosis, respiratory infections (Stavropoulou and Bezirtzoglou 2020).
The role of microbiota homeostasis in aging and age-related diseases is becoming
increasingly evident. Older mice have fewer *Akkermansia muciniphila* bacteria
than younger mice. This reduction in number causes inflammation, which ultimately induces insulin resistance and could leads to type 2 diabetes (Naito et al.
2018). *A. muciniphila* ameliorates the age-related decline in colonic mucus thickness (van der Lugt et al. 2019). Depression is linked with a depletion of the butyrateproducing bacteria *Faecalibacterium* and *Coprococcus* (Valles-Colomer et al. 2019).

Decrease in the proportion of the bacterial family *Prevotellaceae* and bacterial genera
producing butyrate is a marker of Parkinson’s disease (Haikal et al. 2019).
The *Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG* strain reduces appetite, alcohol-induced
microflora disorders, the accumulation of fat, markers of metabolic syndrome, and
stops inflammation in the liver. This strain has also been shown to be effective in
reducing the symptoms of anxiety and depression. The effect is vagus-mediated and
executed through GABA receptors (Capurso 2019).
Food should be prebiotic, that is supporting of beneficial intestinal microflora
(fibrous vegetables, greens, legumes, berries, fruits, nuts) and metabiotic (containing
products of fermentation by bacteria, such as cheese, tofu, miso, kombucha, Pu-erh,
sauerkraut, kimchi, natto, wine, beer).
Metabiotics are fermentation products containing metabolites of beneficial
bacteria. The effect of metabiotic is associated with the fact that microorganisms
live in whole communities, where the waste product of one species is a necessary
substrate for the existence of other species. Metabiotic products do not contain living
microorganisms, but only traces of their activity, which can be useful for our own
microflora, as well as intestinal cells and other tissues.
Bacteria associate with the metabolism of dietary carbohydrates (into short-chain
fatty acids and gases), proteins, plant polyphenols, bile acids, and vitamins (Rowland
et al. 2018). The microbiota can alter the activity of cannabinoid and opioid receptors
in the gut, taste buds in the mouth. Through toxins released by the microbiota, for
example, in response to fasting, it negatively affects mood and increases the desire
to consume food (Alcock et al. 2014). Most of the peripheral pool of neurotransmitters and biogenic amines, such as serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, GABA,
is produced by the intestinal microbiota (Aliper et al. 2016). Fortunately, most of
these neuroactive compounds do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier, however, in
the case of systemic inflammation, its permeability can increase.
The reciprocal relationship between gut microbial metabolism and mental health
is one of the most intriguing and controversial topics in microbiome research.
A catalog of the neuroactive potential of intestinal prokaryotes has been created
(Valles-Colomer et al. 2019). Microbial synthesis of the dopamine metabolite 3,4dihydroxyphenylacetic acid was positively correlated with mental quality of life. In
contrast, microbial synthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid has been implicated in
depression (Valles-Colomer et al. 2019).
The gut microbiome regulates host glucose homeostasis via peripheral serotonin
(Elhassan et al. 2019). Peripheral dopamine controlled by gut microbes inhibits
invariant natural killer T cell-mediated hepatitis (Dang 2020). Gamma-aminobutyric
acid-producinglactobacillipositivelyaffectmetabolismanddepressive-likebehavior
in a mouse model of metabolic syndrome (Patterson et al. 2019). Beneficial
bacteria provide our body with potential geroprotectors such as vitamin K2 (MK-7),
enterolactone, butyrate and spermidine.
The benefits of a diet high in fiber in the colon have been well documented in
epidemiological studies. They provide resistance to influenza through the activation of immune cells (Trompette et al. 2018). Human food enzymes are unable to


-----

21 Nutritional Regulation of Aging and Longevity 447

digest some complex carbohydrates and plant polysaccharides, in particular fructoseoligosaccharides (fructans and inulin), xyloglucans, galacto-oligosaccharides (sialylated oligosaccharides), soluble and insoluble dietary fiber (cellulose), hemicellulose.
Instead, these polysaccharides are metabolized by microbes that form short-chain
fatty acids (SCFAs), including acetate, propionate, and butyrate (Holscher 2017).
Typically, the benefits of the colon microbiota are attributed to short-chain fatty
acids, in particular butyrate. By digesting dietary fiber, microbes create butyrate,
which is a source of energy for mitochondria (Donohoe et al. 2011), enhances their
biogenesis (Clark and Mach 2017) and is an epigenetic regulator. Butyrate is an
inhibitor of the histone deacetylase HDAC (Davie 2003), which plays a key role in
aging at the cellular level (Vizioli et al. 2020). It is also a ligand for G protein coupled
receptors (Bourassa et al. 2016). Receptors GPR41 and GPR43 are expressed in
adipocytes, colon epithelial cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Knockout
mouse studies have shown the involvement of GPR41 and GPR43 in chronic inflammatory diseases such as obesity, colitis, asthma, and arthritis (Ang and Ding 2016).
Lys14 of histone H3 (H3K14) was found to be a propionylation and butyrylation
site *in vivo* . H3K14pr and H3K14bu labels are set by histone acetyltransferases. The
promoters of active genes are preferably enriched with these labels and are recognized by acylation-specific reading proteins. Also, propionyl-CoA appears to be able
to stimulate transcription (Kebede et al. 2017).
Butyrate, a major metabolite of intestinal bacteria and crucial energy source for gut
epithelial cells, also possesses anti-inflammatory properties (Saemann et al. 2000).
Butyrate inhibits the accumulation and effects of neurotoxic ceramide, formed during
intestinal permeability disorders in dysbiosis (Amano et al. 2019). Not only dietary
fiber is a source of butyrate. Human intestine bacteria *Intestinimonas* strain AF211
synthetize butyrate from lysine and the Amadori product fructoselysine (Bui et al.
2015). Colonocytes of the large intestine, which are in constant contact with butyrate,
need it as an energy resource, but it is destructive for interstitial stem cells, and they
hide in crypts (Snippert 2016). Dietary indigestible fibers alter the composition of
the gut microbiota and its metabolic profile in such a way that the abundance of longchain fatty acids also increases. They promote the activity of autoimmune suppressive
TH2 cells (Berer et al. 2018).
Commensal bacteria, including *Escherichia coli*, stimulate HDAC activity by
metabolizing phytate and producing inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3). Intestinal
effects of InsP3 and ingestion of phytate promote intestinal regeneration after injury
(Ma et al. 2020). However, SCFAs are not the only beneficial gut microflora products.
Brial et al. identify the inverse correlation between diabetes and serum 4-cresol, a
metabolite produced by intestinal bacteria (Brial et al. 2020). Microbial tryptophan
catabolites from proteolysis affect the health of the host (Roager and Licht 2018).
It is assumed that these metabolites activate the immune system by binding to the
cyclic hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), strengthen the intestinal epithelial barrier, stimulate gastrointestinal motility, as well as the secretion of intestinal hormones, have
anti-inflammatory, antioxidant effects in the systemic circulation, and presumably
modulate the intestinal microbial composition.

During aging, goblet cells are loosing, which secrete mucus to protect the epithelium. Indoles, which are secreted by the gut microbiota, act through the aryl carbohydrate receptor and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, restoring depleted goblet
cells in older animals (Powell et al. 2020). Indole prevents steatohepatitis (Altunina
et al. 2020). Indolepropionic acid, a gut microbiota-produced metabolite, preserves
β-cell function and prevents T2D (de Mello et al. 2017). *Bifidobacterium*, *Allobac-*
*ulum*, and *Parabacteroides* in the intestine produce hydrogen (Nishimura 2018), a
potent antioxidant, attenuating risk factors of metabolic syndrome (LeBaron et al.
2020).
Another useful microbiota product is polyamine spermidine. It is also found
among foods: it is most of all in sprouts of cereals and legumes. Spermidine intake
is associated with a reduction in overall mortality and mortality from cardiovascular
disease and cancer in humans (Kiechl et al. 2018). Experiments in mice have shown
that spermidine can increase lifespan, prevent the development of liver fibrosis and
malignant hepatoma, one of the most common forms of cancer, through the induction
of chaperone-mediated autophagy (Shen et al. 2017). Spermidine delays tumor onset
in a mouse model of induced lung cancer (Eisenberg et al. 2016). Supplementation
with autophagy-activating spermidine has been shown to protect against neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in animal models (Buttner et al. 2014; Wang et al.
2015). Spermidine has a cardioprotective effect (Eisenberg et al. 2016). It lowers
blood pressure and has a vasoprotective effect (Eisenberg et al. 2017). Spermidine
promotes hair growth (Ramot 2011). The molecular mechanism of the geroprotective action of spermidine is that it inhibits the activity of EP300 acetyltransferase,
which suppresses autophagy (Madeo et al. 2018). Spermidine reverses D-galactoseinduced skeletal muscle atrophy in aging rats by enhancing autophagy and decreasing
apoptosis through the AMPK-FOXO3a signaling pathway (Fan et al. 2017). By its
mechanism of action, it is also a mimetic of low-calorie nutrition (Minois 2014).
Vitamin K2 is produced by the gut microbiota. Vitamin K2 contributes to the
retention of calcium in the bone mass, preventing its redistribution into blood vessels
and the risk of calcification (Schwalfenberg 2017; Vossen et al. 2015). Microbiota
can transform polyphenols into bioavailable phenolic acids with geroprotector and
anti-inflammatory effects, reducing cardio-metabolic risks (Correa et al. 2019).
The gut microbiota can also be negative. A high-fat diet encourages the proliferation of *Acinetobacter* bacteria, which suppresses EEC cells in the intestines, which
blocks the normal exchange of signals between the intestine and the brain (Ye et al.
2019).
Microbial-derived acetate contributes to the development of metabolic syndrome
(Perry et al. 2016). In male rats resistant to insulin and prone to obesity, it was
found that the consumption of fatty foods in the blood plasma and faeces of animals
increased 1.5–3 times the rate of formation and concentration of acetate, but not
propionate or butyrate. This acetate is of microbial origin. In animals that received
fatty foods, the secretion of insulin is several times higher than in the control. This
insulin spike is triggered by acetate through its effects on the centers in the brain that
activate the parasympathetic nervous system. At the same time, there is a surge in
gastrin, which makes you feel hungry (Perry et al. 2016). By the way, acetate formed

during alcohol metabolism in the liver appears to be the cause of additive behavior,
modulating gene expression in the brain via acetyl CoA synthetase 2 (Ghrayeb et al.
2019).
After glycolysis, with an insufficient amount of oxygen in the cell, L-lactate is
formed, which acidifies the blood, but in the liver it can be converted into glucose or
used by the brain as a metabolism regulator and a source of energy (Riske et al. 2017).
However, lactobacilli and some other lactic acid bacteria are able to secrete another
type of lactate, D-lactate (Vitetta et al. 2017). This substance exhibits cardio and
neurotoxicity, contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction (Ling et al. 2012). Pickles,
yoghurt, sour milk, tomatoes, apples, beer and wine lead to some increase in D-lactate
(Kowlgi and Chhabra 2015).
Carnitine and choline are major precursors for the gut microbiota-dependent
generation of a TMA, which in the liver converts into an atherogenic metabolite,
TMAO. Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) promotes age-related vascular oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in mice and healthy humans (Brunt et al.
2020). Studying the intestinal microbiome in subjects characterized by phenotypes
of TMAO producers, identified 39 functional taxonomic units that correlated with
TMAO productivity, including *Emergencia timonensis* and *Ihubacter massiliensis*
(Wu et al. 2020). In randomized controlled trials, chronic consumption of red
meat in the diet increases systemic TMAO levels by rising microbial production of
TMA/TMAOfromcarnitine,butnotcholine.Stoppingredmeatconsumptionreduces
plasma TMAO within 4 weeks (W. Wang et al. 2019).
The severity of the effect of pathogenic microbiota on health is due to the degree
of permeability of the gastrointestinal and blood–brain barrier. Factors that damage
the barrier function of the intestinal epithelium contribute to the development of
inflammatory reactions to food antigens. For example, reovirus infection triggers
inflammatory responses to dietary antigens (Bouziat et al. 2017). Enteropathogenic
*E. coli* disrupts tight junction barrier function (Shifflett et al. 2005). Fructose stimulateing lipogenesis in liver, disrupting intestinal barrier and provoking inflammation
(Lambertz et al. 2017; Todoric et al. 2020). Hyperglycemia drives intestinal barrier
dysfunction (Thaiss et al. 2018). Proinflammatory cytokines disrupt epithelial barrier
function (Bruewer et al. 2003). Ethanol impairs intestinal barrier function (Elamin
2014). Theoretically, it is possible to develop approaches to correct this condition.
Normalizationofintestinalmicroflora-awaytoeliminateincreasedintestinalpermeability and prevent autoimmune disorders (Mu et al. 2017). Some isoflavones, such
as puerarin, can improve barrier function (Che et al. 2020).
###### ***21.2.3 Anti-inflammatory Foods***

Aging is a chronic inflammatory process. Overeating, intestinal dysbiosis, and
vitamin D deficiency as dietary factors contribute to chronic inflammation (Moskalev
et al. 2020). Chronic inflammation, in turn, underlies age-related diseases such as
cardiovascular, cognitive (e.g., depression), sleep disorders, and neoplastic diseases.

450 A. Moskalev

At the same time, it is known that regular consumption of some foods promotes
inflammation,whileothersreduceit.ItiswellknownthatMediterraneandiethasantiinflammatory effect, which is characterized by the use of olive oil as the main source
of fat, a high consumption of fruits, nuts, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, spices,
and herbs, as well as a moderate consumption of dairy products (mainly cheese and
yogurt), fish, poultry, and a reduced consumption of red meat and processed foods
(Fernandes 2020).
Antioxidants reduce inflammation. Diet antioxidant status can be analyzed using a
[database (see: https://www.superfoodly.com/orac-values). Direct anti-inflammatory](https://www.superfoodly.com/orac-values)
effect is exerted by such biologically active food substances as alpha-lipoic acid,
glycine, genistein, kaempferol, apigenin, oridonin, gamma-tocotrienol, phenethyl
caffeic acid ester, hydroxytyrosol, procyanidins, resveratrol, quercetin, theaflavin,
epigalquinate, rutin, isothiocyanates, capsaicin, zinc and magnesium (Altunina et al.
2020; Iddir 2020; Joseph et al. 2016; Liu and Dudley 2020; Proshkina 2020b). The
specially developed DDI index can be used to evaluate the diet in terms of its
inflammatory status (Cavicchia et al. 2009).
###### ***21.2.4 Antimutagenic Foods***

The environmental insults and internal errors in cell metabolism can lead to DNA

damage and mutations that accelerate the aging of the body (Moskalev et al. 2013).
Mutagenic factors are:

- Ionizing radiation (air travel, X-ray exposure, space radiation, background
radiation level);

- UVB light;

- Reactive forms of oxygen, nitrogen and chlorine (free radicals), including
inflammation;

- Viruses;

- Mutagenic chemicals (benzpyrene, acrolein, nitroso compounds, polycyclic
hydrocarbons);

- Cell division (replication errors, telomere shortening).

Antimutagenic foods reducs the risk of DNA damage and the accumulation of
mutations. According to their mechanism of action, they either prevent DNA damage
(ROS-scavengers), are cofactors of repair enzymes, or, as hormetins, induce the
expression of their own antioxidant and repair enzymes in the cell. Antimutagenic
substances in food include a wide range of compounds (Proshkina et al. 2020). In
particular, in food products, cysteine (red peppers, onions, garlic, Brussels sprouts,
broccoli, poultry, fermented milk products), gallic acid (chicory, grapefruit, cloudberries, tea, oregano, apples, pomegranates), lipoic acid (spinach, broccoli, tomatoes,
peas), polyphenols (legumes, tomatoes, various berries, red wine, cocoa, chocolate,
tea, curry), organic forms of selenium (Brazil nuts, cashews, fish, turkey, chicken,
brown rice, legumes, mushrooms, oatmeal, spinach) (Sloczynska et al. 2014).

21 Nutritional Regulation of Aging and Longevity 451
###### ***21.2.5 Hormetic Foods***

Stress response proteins play a key role in the maintenance of vital functions at the
cellular level. Lack of some essential nutrients, DNA damage, hypoxia, exposure to
toxins, high or low temperatures are perceived by cells as stress factors. They can
cause significant damage, and if the cell did not appropriately respond to them and
repair itself, it would die. Activating the stress response and recovery system can not
only reverse damage, but also put the system at a higher level of protection against
new spontaneous errors and damage, including those associated with aging. Stress
resistance mechanisms can be induced by factors that promote moderate stress, which
is not accompanied by significant damage, but is able to activate a protective response.
This phenomenon is called “hormesis”, and its agents are called “hormetins” (Rattan
and Demirovic 2009). *(also see the chapter on nutritional hormetins in this book).*
Hormetins moderately activate the cell’s own stress response mechanisms: mild
DNA damage inducers quercetin (capers, onions, cranberries, plums, blueberries,
currants, cherries, apples) (Yamashita and Kawanishi 2000), sulforaphane (Sestili
et al. 2010) (chopped broccoli) or curcumin (curry, turmeric) (Ting et al. 2015),
mitohormetins resveratrol (red grapes, peanuts) (Gueguen 2015), carnosine (turkey,
chicken) (Calabrese et al. 2012) and N -acetylglucosamine (mushrooms, cartilage,
shrimp) (Matsumura 2020). ***21.2.6 Low Glycemic Load***

The glycemic index is an estimate of the rate at which various foods can raise blood
sugar levels. The higher the glycemic index, the more harmful the use of the product
is considered in terms of the appearance of excess weight and insulin resistance.
When determining the glycemic load, not only the rate of absorption of glucose after
consumption of a particular product is considered, but also the amount of carbohydrates in it. That is, the rate of increase in blood sugar level is determined, and how
much this level will rise and, accordingly, how long it will hold at a high level before
the body can reduce it to normal levels.
The diet should be low in glycation end products, low insulin- and glycemic
index and glycemic load. These are products containing slowly digestible carbohydrates (durum wheat pasta, whole grain cereals, legumes, vegetables, herbs). On the
contrary, it is better to avoid sweet, starchy vegitables, white rice. When preparing
food, it is worth avoiding frying or baking, in which glycation end products are
formed in large quantities.
Glucose is proinflammatory (Dandona et al. 2007), and a low-glycemic diet
can help reduce inflammation (Steckhan et al. 2016). There are databases of
food glycemic indices and glycemic loads (Foster-Powell et al. 2002). Insulinemia
contributes to obesity and thus can provoke inflammation. High insulin also causes


-----

high blood pressure. The insulin index of the diet can be also assessed (Neuhouser
et al. 2006).
Glycation end products cause extracellular matrix stiffness (Fedintsev and
Moskalev 2020) and inflammation via RAGEs (Alexey Moskalev et al. 2021). There
is a database that allows the analysis of glycation end products in the diet (Uribarri
et al. 2010). In addition to glucose, glycation end products are provoked by methylglyoxal (Baig et al. 2017), fructose, galactose, ribose, or glyceraldehyde (Syrovy
1994). Fructose should be more controlled in food from this point of view because it
is 10 times more reactive than glucose (Gugliucci 2017). In turn, galactose is generally used in experiments as a factor causing accelerated aging (Azman and Zakaria
2019).
###### ***21.2.7 Foods Containing Potential Geroprotectors***

Many biologically active substances of natural origin in experiments on laboratory
organisms showed geroprotective properties, increasing lifespan (Barardo et al. 2017;
A. Moskalev et al. 2015; Proshkina et al. 2020b). Food biologically active substances
can inhibit major aging-associated signaling pathways such as PI3K/mTor (Huang
2013), p38 (Guerra and Issinger 2019), NF-kB (Nam 2006).
There are preclinical studies showing NAD+ precursors as a powerful and safe
geroprotector (Braidy and Liu 2020). If we trace where our body can get it or
what depletes it, it turns out that it is possible to regulate its level through nutrition
(Fig. 21.1).
Another notable geroprotector in food is spermidine (Madeo et al. 2018), which
has been shown to slow down the aging of the nervous system, boosting autophagy
(Bhukel et al. 2017).

###### **21.3 Aging Epigenetics and Nutrition**

Epigenetic changes are inheritable but reversible modifications of DNA and chromatin that do not change the primary nucleotide sequence but cause a change
in gene activity. For each organism in any of its cells is one genome, but many
epigenomes. Epigenetic regulation is carried out at the level of DNA (methylation
of CpG islands), chromatin (modification of histone proteins), and RNA (methylation of RNA, microRNA, and long non-coding RNAs). Epigenetic regulation plays
a decisive role in development. In the early stages of embryonic development, cells
actively demethylate their DNA. Multicellular organisms differentiate cell types,
tissues, and organs by regulating gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms
such as DNA methylation, histone methylation and acetylation.
With age, there is a global decrease in the level of DNA methylation, genespecific hypermethylation and chromatin remodeling (Tollefsbol 2018). As a result,
age-dependent tissue-specific overexpression/repression of about 10% of genes of
the entire genome occurs, which plays a decisive role in reducing the regenerative and
reparative abilities of cells and tissues and causes a functional decline in age-related
diseases. Epigenetic age, or methylation clocks, is becoming the industry standard
for assessing the aging rate and biological age of an individual (Moskalev 2020).

The rate of aging-associated epigenetic changes is influenced by both hereditary
factors (associated, for example, with the efficiency of assimilation of B vitamins:
B6, B9, B12, betaine) and nutrition. For instance, vitamins B6, B9, B12, C, A play an
important role in regulating the degree of DNA methylation (Ferreira et al. 2020). The
degree of histone acetylation is also regulated by functional nutrition. In particular,
the high degree of histone acetylation under the influence of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) accelerates aging, and the donor of acetate groups is acetyl-CoA,
which occurs in large quantities in the cell during a high-calorie fatty diet. Spermidine (found in fermented foods, mushrooms, sprouts) and a low-calorie diet reduce
HATs activity (Pietrocola et al. 2015). The high activity of HDAC 1–3 deacetylases
also increases the aging rate (McIntyre et al. 2019), therefore their inhibitors (3,3’di-indolylmethane, isothiocyanates (sulforaphane), Se-methyl-1-selenocysteine in
broccoli; equol, genistein in legumes; apigenin in citrus fruits and parsley; chrysin in
olive oil; quercetin and ursolic acid in apples and green tea; allicin, diallyl disulfide
in garlic; caffeic acid and catechins green tea; coumarin/hydroxycinnamic acid in
cinnamon; curcumin in curry) may be considered as the potential geroprotectors. On
the other hand, the increased activity of deacetylases of histones of the SIRT family
slows down aging. SIRT1 activators are pterostilbene, piceatannol, resveratrol (blueberries, blackberries, black grapes, red wine), fisetin (fresh cucumbers, strawberries),
quercetin (cranberries, onions, apples, blueberries).
The SIRT-activating diet called the Sirtfood Diet is gaining popularity (Pallauf
2013), which for example includes regular consumption of polyphenol-rich foods:
legumes, capers, blueberries, green tea, olive oil, parsley, arugula, strawberries, citrus
fruits, apples, kale, black coffee and curry.
###### **21.4 Antinutrients**

Many nutritionists recommend avoiding phytic acid, which is stored as a source of
phosphorus in the seeds and nuts. Since it interferes with the assimilation of some
macro- and microelements - magnesium, calcium, iron, zinc, copper. However, it is a
chelator of excess transition metals, which cause glycation through the Maillard reaction. Clinical studies have shown its benefit in reducing glycation levels in diabetic
patients (Sanchis et al. 2018). The medicinal value of phytic acid outweighs its negative effects (Abdulwaliyu et al. 2019). The most rational thing is not to pre-soak
whole grains, legumes or nuts containing phytic acid, but to use them as a separate
meal. In this case, they will not interfere with the absorption of trace elements from
other foods.

Lectins are proteins with a high degree of stereospecificity in recognition of
various sugar structures and the formation of reversible bonds when interacting with
glycoconjugate complexes. They are found in abundance in plants (legumes, nightshades, whole grains, peanut), animals and many other species, and are known to
agglutinate various erythrocyte blood groups. Lectins are easily destroyed even after
10 minutes of heat treatment. So if you don’t eat raw legumes, grains, and potato


-----

skins, you won’t get harmful dosages. There are really toxic lectins - ricin, phytohemagglutinin, but you are unlikely to encounter them in toxic amounts. In contrast,
some lectins are beneficial with anti-cancer, immunomodulatory, and antimicrobial
properties (Mishra 2019).
Moreover, as it becomes clear now, plant lectins inactivate pathogenic microflora,
stimulate the phagocytic activity of cellular immunity, and act as “natural vaccines”.
###### **21.5 Diet Regimen and Longevity**

It should be noted that it is not only the qualitative and quantitative composition of
the diet that matters, but also the diet regimen. For example, a 10-h Time-limited
Meal (TRE) in metabolic syndrome (MetS) patients promotes weight loss, reduces
waist circumference, body fat percentage, and visceral fat. TRE in MetS lowers blood
pressure, atherogenic lipids and glycated hemoglobin (Wilkinson et al. 2020). On
the other hand, the use of TRE in old age is less beneficial for health than regular
exercise (Schafer et al. 2019).
In contrast, fractional meals often recommended by nutritionists have mixed
health effects. A meta-analysis comparing 15 studies did not support the conclusion
about the benefits of split meals for maintaining optimal body weight (Schoenfeld
et al. 2015). In one of the latest clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes
mellitus, the state of metabolic health markers was compared in two groups: the first
ate thoroughly twice a day, the second - six times a day in small portions. Patients
in the first group had a decrease in body weight, the amount of fat in the liver, and
fasting plasma glucose levels, as well as an increase in the efficiency of glucose
absorption, compared with those who divided the same number of calories into six
meals (Kahleova et al. 2014). With frequent snacks, the level of saturation hormones
(insulin and leptin) is constantly high. As a result, the regulatory parts of the brain
get used to this evenly high background and become insensitive to it. That is, tissue
resistance to insulin and leptin signals is formed. And this leads to a deterioration in
the regulation of both eating behavior and metabolism in general. Being hungry all
the time increases your risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular problems.
Returning to the traditional diet (less often, but full), it is possible to normalize the
level of these hormones in the blood, the sensitivity of tissues to them and the energy
balance in the body. Some foods are addictive and overeating. A rating of such food
has been compiled (Schulte et al. 2015). **21.6 Diet of Long Living Persons**

The traditional diet in Okinawa differs significantly from the general Japanese one
and is based on the use of sweet potatoes (completely replaces rice), leafy vegetables,
yellow root vegetables, soy products (miso and tofu) and medicinal plants. Seafood

and algae, lean pork, fruits, spices (primarily turmeric), tea, and weak alcohol are
consumed in moderation. There are practically no dairy products in the diet. Salt
replaced with spices. Thus, the traditional Okinawan diet is low in calories, contains
a low ratio of omega 6/omega 3 fatty acids (close to 1: 1), has a low glycemic index,
includes a little meat, but a lot of plant fiber. The Okinawan diet slows down the
development of cardiovascular disease and inflammation (Willcox et al. 2009).
A diet close to the Paleolithic or Mediterranean reduces the risk of all-cause

mortality. The Mediterranean diet has proven to be the most effective. The Paleolithic
dietwascommonamongtheancienthunter-gatherersbeforetheadventofagriculture.
The structure of the diet is characterized by a predominantly plant-based diet, with
a wide variety of fruits, nuts, and vegetables. It also includes lean meats and is low
in dairy, grains, sugar, and salt (Whalen et al. 2017). The Mediterranean is like the
Paleolithic, but allows a moderate consumption of grains, dairy products, and alcohol.
The Mediterranean diet is the traditional diet of the Mediterranean countries - Italy
and Greece. It is characterized by high consumption of olive oil (as the main dietary
fat), vegetables, legumes, whole grains, fruits and nuts, moderate consumption of
poultry and fish, low consumption of fatty dairy products and red meat, and moderate
consumption of wine as the main source of alcohol, consumed exclusively at the same
time as food. As it turned out, it is in Italy and Greece that people who adhere to
traditional food habits are less likely to suffer from neoplastic and cardiovascular
diseases. The Mediterranean diet does not reduce body fat in general, but it does
reduce the proportion of fat in the liver, which leads to metabolic syndrome and
chronic disease (Gepner et al. 2019). Unlike the Western diet, it protects against
steatohepatitis (Shively et al. 2019). In the EPIC-Potsdam cohort, the Mediterranean
Diet associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes in the overall population and of
myocardial infarction in women (Galbete et al. 2018).
The Nordic or Scandinavian diet is based on staples such as cabbage, rye
bread, root vegetables, apples, pears, northern berries, oatmeal, shellfish, and fish.
According to research, adherence to such a diet reduces the risk of death. In the EPICPotsdam cohort, the Nordic diet showed a possible beneficial effect on myocardial
infarction in the overall population and for stroke in men (Galbete et al. 2018).
Traditional healthy Nordic foods was found to be related to lower mortality among
middle-aged Danes, in particular among men (Olsen et al. 2011). It should be noted
that a common feature of traditional diets is the absence of processed food, the freshness of the products (which is achieved due to the locality and seasonality of the
diet).
###### **21.7 Conclusions**

Nowadays, the principles of healthy eating are common to all. However, each person
is unique and carries own risks of genetic predisposition, has a individual metabolic
rate, physical, and mental activity. A personalized approach to the diet for longevity
can be expected in the future. It will consider genetic predisposition, gender, biological age, physical and intellectual activity, concomitant diseases, clinical analyzes
(excess or lack of essential fatty and amino acids, vitamins, minerals in the blood,

markers of metabolism, microbiota, biological age). Regular monitoring of all these
data, together with the technologies of synthetic food products and 3D-printing, will
allow to personally approach the needs of the body, eliminate harmful influences,
introduce potential geroprotectors into the diet, and make healthy food the most
aesthetic and tasty. In principle, it is technologically possible already now.

##### **Chapter 22**
#### **Gerosuppressive and Senolytic Nutrients**

**Jan O. Nehlin**

**Abstract** The aging process is intimately regulated by the contribution of interactions between genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors. Every individual is
distinguished by a specific personal lifestyle, since conception, that influences the
state of health, either leading to the preservation of a good state of health or accelerated aging trajectories that could hasten the occurrence of disease. The intake of
specific nutritional factors, investigated in large epidemiological studies, have long
been considered associated with specific health outcomes and prevention of health
problems. As a result of the aging process, the occurrence of senescent cells within
the body can cause damage to organs and tissues leading to many age-associated
pathologies. The advent of the nutritional geroscience field is contributing to reveal
how a diverse number of phytochemicals can help to reduce the rate of cell proliferation, enhance cellular function, eradicate senescent cells, or suppress, at varying
degrees, their abnormal secretomes, mitigating the extent of damage posed by them
in the body. A summary of senotherapeutic biomolecules acting as senolytics and
gerosuppressors will be here presented, to strengthen our knowledge that natural
compounds present in the diet, when given at the right time, at the right dose and in
combination, could extend the duration of health span and the overall lifespan.

###### **22.1 Introduction**

Since conception, humans are exposed to a nutritional environment that will shape
their future health trajectories, during all their lifetimes. The interplay between nutritional lifestyle, parental epigenetic factors, and inherited gene variants will determine
how well the body will function and cope with all the stresses that will be confronted
with time. J. O. Nehlin ( B )

Traditional medicine, through thousands of years of experience, has contributed
to unravel the identities of natural products that could have a role in preserving
health, mitigating symptoms of disease, accelerated healing, and general well-being
(Mukherjee et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2018). The chemical identification of the active
ingredients with both beneficial and detrimental roles has been ongoing for decades.
The health benefits of Mediterranean and Asian diets have been confirmed in
many clinical trials and epidemiological surveys. These diets are characterized by
several features, including low meat consumption, fish consumption, the intake of
oils instead of fats as lipid sources, moderate amounts of red wine, and significant
amounts of fresh fruit and vegetables. Polyphenols have been shown to have multiple
healtheffectsasdemonstratedbyseveralrelevantpopulationstudiesandclinicaltrials
(Leri et al. 2020; Cannataro et al. 2021; Shen et al. 2017; Gensous et al. 2020; Quach
et al. 2017). The cellular mechanisms by which polyphenols exert their function has
been recently reviewed (Russo et al. 2020; Mansoori et al. 2021; Jantan et al. 2021)
as well as the role of polyphenols against aging and cancer (Bian et al. 2020; Russo
et al. 2020).
The role of the microbiota needs to be highlighted in relation to healthy aging,
because it is intimately associated with the specific intake of nutrients, and long-term
health consequences (Fragkou et al. 2021, Tavella et al. 2021), as well as parameters
such as eating time (Taetzsch et al. 2021).
###### **22.2 General Considerations**

Senescent cells arise in the body during development, stress, disease and aging
(Childs et al. 2017). Several mechanisms can lead to senescence including replicative
senescence (RS), stress-induced senescence (SIPS), oncogene-induced senescence
(OIS), mitochondrial dysfunction-associated senescence (MiDAS), and many more
(Di Micco et al. 2021; Calcinotto et al. 2019).
The immune system targets senescent cells that harbor damage that could pose
a potential risk if allowed to bypass the senescent state (Prata et al. 2018, Kale
et al. 2020). However, with time, immune function gradually decays giving rise
to immunosenescence. The immune cells responsible for targeting and eliminating
senescent cells become reduced in number and function, thereby allowing senescent
cells to accumulate in the body (Rodrigues et al. 2021, Prata et al. 2018, Kale et al.
2020). The accumulation of senescent cells results in the characteristic low-grade
chronic inflammation that is associated with age, which causes organ dysfunction
(Childs et al. 2017; Furman et al. 2019).
Aging is a universal living condition that is accompanied by an increased risk
of age-associated diseases, all of which are gathered under the concept of geriatric
syndrome. The World Health Organization (WHO) has categorized senescence as
a significant risk factor behind the origin of older age diseases (Code MG2A: Old
age; International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 11th (June 2018). Senolytics (see

Sects. 22.3 and 22.4) are considered an aid to prolong the state of disease-free lifetime
in people (Khaltourina et al. 2020).
###### **22.3 Definitions and Classification of Senotherapeutics**

Senotherapeutics or gerotherapeutics are compounds, medicines or protocols that
exert senotherapy, an intervention targeting senescent cells, being considered an
emerging strategy for the extension of health span, and prevention or treatment of
age-associated diseases. At present, senotherapeutics can be classified in:
(1) Senolytics; (2) Gerosuppressors (SASP modulators or inhibitors); (3) Geroprotectors; (4) Epigenetic modifiers; (5) Gene therapeutics
The first four classes of senotherapeutics include nutritional components, whereas
gene therapy strategies are mostly aimed at editing genes that might predispose to
accelerated aging, less successful aging and even, enhance polymorphic variants
to increase the length of health span, postpone the appearance of aging-associated
diseases and extend lifespan.
The present work will consider the nutritional aspects involved in aging and focus
on those compounds that exhibit senolytic and gerosuppressive functions. The nutritional geroscience field aims for the identification and characterization of nutritional
compounds that have an effect on the function and/or viability of senescent cells,
as well as health promoting activities that reduce or postpone the genesis of senescence. Some recent works have presented a list of senotherapeutics that are either in
the discovery phase or are at different stages of clinical trials (Prasanna et al. 2021;
Kirkland and Tchkonia 2020; Paez-Ribes et al. 2019; Morsli and Bellantuono 2021;
Short et al. 2019). **22.4 Senolytics**

Senolytics are defined as a new class of drugs that selectively kill senescent cells.
They comprise small molecules that specifically induce cell death in senescent cells,
targeting a number of targets including survival pathways and anti-apoptotic mechanisms (Zhu et al. 2015; Yosef et al. 2016). Several recent reviews have dealt with
the topic of senolytic compounds (Kirkland and Tchkonia 2020; Martel et al. 2020;
Robbins et al. 2021; Short et al. 2019).
Most studies on senolytics so far have focused on the effects of senescent cell eradicators in cell culture and mice studies. Such studies have rendered a great deal of
knowledge as regards the specificity and extent of senolytic compounds on the alleviation of the senescent cell burden on specific tissues and their corresponding pathologies, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (Justice et al. 2019), renal fibrosis postacute kidney injury (Li et al. 2021), diabetic kidney disease (Hickson et al. 2019),
eye age-macular degeneration (Lee et al. 2021), bone loss (Farr et al. 2017; Chandra

et al. 2020), cardiac ischemia–reperfusion injury (Dookun et al. 2020b), cardiovascular disease (Dookun et al. 2020a, Song et al. 2020), osteoarthritis (Dai et al.
2020; Jeon et al. 2017), diabetes (Palmer et al. 2021, Thompson et al. 2019), cognitive decline (Bussian et al. 2018), uterine fibrosis (Cavalcante et al. 2020), cancer
(Picallos-Rabina et al. 2020), frailty (Xu et al. 2018), etc. The first documented study
to report the elimination of senescent cells in vivo in humans by senolytics was the
report by Justice et al., in idiopathic pulmonary disease (Justice et al. 2019).
Many ongoing pre-clinical and clinical trials (Kirkland and Tchkonia 2020;
Prasanna et al. 2021) will provide unequivocal evidence of the role of senolytics
in a variety of human aging-associated diseases (Childs et al. 2017).
Several phytochemicals belonging to the flavonoid family have been documented
to exhibit potent senolytic activities (Yousefzadeh et al. 2018). A list of foods
describing their flavonoid contents and amounts is available (Haytowitz et al. 2018).
Early epidemiological studies already showed that the intake of foods containing
flavonoids such as quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, apigenin, and luteolin, was
significantly inversely associated with mortality from coronary heart disease (Hertog
et al. 1993).
Many senolytics can upregulate SIRT1 activity, a sirtuin that belongs to the family
of class III histone deacetylases, whose enzymatic activity is dependent on NAD [+] .
SIRT1 is implicated in the cellular response to caloric restriction and lifespan extension (Iside et al. 2020). Several natural compounds that activate the Nrf2 (nuclear
factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2) pathway, controlling the cellular response
to stress caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS), have been found to be senolytic
(Malavolta et al. 2018).
While senolytics seem to be very promising compounds, there are concerns as
regards their possible side effects or disadvantages, if their administration exceeds
specific concentrations, and duration, and whether the recipient suffers or not from
an age-associated disease (Martin et al. 2021, Raffaele et al. 2021). For such reasons,
the National Institute on Aging, USA, has called for standardization in the investigations and measures regarding senotherapeutic use, including reports on the balance
between senolytic and cytotoxic effects, markers of specific senescent cell types
linked to the specific interventions, interactions with coexisting diseases and their
effects at various ages, especially in older people (Romashkan et al. 2021).
Senolytics can be classified as being of nutritional origin or pharmaceutical origin.
Both classes will be addressed in this summary, with focus on senolytics from natural

sources.
###### ***22.4.1 Nutritional Senolytics***

Nutritional senolytics are compounds that originate from natural sources and exhibit
senolytic activity. The most studied nutritional senolytics are presented, but the
list is likely to grow further as more research will reveal whether known or novel
polyphenols possess senolytic activities.


-----

22 Gerosuppressive and Senolytic Nutrients 469

Below, a list of prominent, well-documented, nutritional senolytic compounds
(in alphabetical order) aims to describe their origin, targets and possible uses in
senotherapy.

**22.4.1.1** **Allicin**

Allicin (diallyl thiosulfinate) is a volatile sulfur compound present in garlic ( *Allium*
*sativum* ), a vegetable with multiple health effects (Borlinghaus et al. 2021). The
health-promoting and disease-preventing effects of garlic on many human common
diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, blood pressure,
and diabetes, through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and lipid-lowering properties, have been documented in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies (Ansary et al. 2020).
Allicin has antiproliferative, anticlonogenic, and senolytic effects. In addition, allicin
decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis by loss of *��* m, caspase-3, caspase-8,
and caspase-9 activation, upregulation of NOXA, P21, and BAK, as well as downregulation of BCL-XL expression in breast cancer cell lines (Rosas-Gonzalez et al.
2020).

**22.4.1.2** **Curcumin and Curcumin Analogues**

Curcumin is a yellow polyphenolic pigment from the turmeric ( *Curcuma longa L* .)
rhizomethathastraditionallybeenusedinculinaryandfoodcoloring,andasaningredient in Ayurveda and Chinese medicine health promotion and disease prevention
(Sharifi-Rad et al. 2020). Numerous studies suggest that curcumin has some health
benefits in delaying aging and may be useful in preventing and treating age-related
diseases(Cherifetal. 2019,Ziaetal. 2021;Sharifi-Radetal. 2020;Bielak-Zmijewska
et al. 2019). Curcumin has been shown to have senolytic activity (Yousefzadeh et al.
2018). Among four commonly used curcumin analogs, EF24, HO-3867, 2-HBA and
dimethoxycurcumin (DIMC), EF24 is the most potent and broad-spectrum senolytic
agent. EF24 exerts selective lysis of senescent cells through the induction of apoptosis
in a reactive oxygen species (ROS) production independent manner but associated
with an increase in the proteasome degradation of the Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic protein
family proteins known to play an important role in protecting senescent cells from
apoptosis (Li et al. 2019).

**22.4.1.3** **Fisetin**

Fisetin, with the chemical name 2-(3,4-Dihydroxyphenyl)-3,7-dihydroxy-4 *H* -1benzopyran-4-one, a flavonol, is a secondary metabolite of many plants, occurring in
their green parts, fruits, as well as in barks and hardwood, that has anti-inflammatory,
chemopreventive, chemotherapeutic and recently also senotherapeutic roles. Fisetin
is present instrawberries, apples, persimmons, grapes, onions, kiwi, kale, nuts, smoke

tree ( *Cotinus coggygria* ), etc. (Grynkiewicz and Demchuk 2019; Mehta et al. 2018)
and influences many cellular pathways (Kashyap et al. 2019). Fisetin is considered
a senolytic because it was found to selectively induce apoptosis in senescent but
not proliferating human umbilical vein endothelial cells. However, it was not shown
to be a senolytic in a senescent human lung fibroblast strain, or primary human
preadipocytes (Zhu et al. 2017). Fisetin was found to be the most potent senolytic
in a panel of ten flavonoid polyphenols using senescent mouse and human cells.
Moreover, when given to wild-type mice late in life, fisetin restored tissue homestasis, reduced age-related pathologies, and extended median and maximum lifespan
(Yousefzadeh et al. 2018). Fisetin is one of the senolytics that has been shown to have
toxiceffectswhenadministeredinhighdosis(200 μM)inrat,inducingmitochondrial
pro-oxidant activity (Constantin et al. 2011). Fisetin has other side effects such as the
promotion of hair growth by activation of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)
expression in skin hair follicle bulge stem cells (Kubo et al. 2020). A summary of
the in vivo evidence for fisetin targeting multiple age-associated dysfunctions and
pathologies in mammals has been presented (Morsli and Bellantuono 2021).

**22.4.1.4** **Luteolin**

Luteolin, with the chemical name 2-(3,4-Dihydroxyphenyl)-5,7-dihydroxy-4chromenone, is a flavone, subclass of flavonoids, which is found in many vegetables, spices, fruits and medicinal herbs. It has many health benefits, and appears
especially suited to alleviate the symptoms of glycolipid metabolism disorders such
as insulin resistance, diabetes, and obesity (Wang et al. 2021). It was shown to
have weak senolytic activity, in a comparative study with other flavonoids (see
4.1.3) (Yousefzadeh et al. 2018) but it has powerful anti-inflammatory actions in
concert with IL-37 and IL-38 interleukins (Conti et al. 2021). Luteolin diminishes
human neutrophil inflammatory responses by inhibiting Raf1-MEK-1-Erk, significantly inhibited superoxide anion generation, ROS production, and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation in human neutrophils. The increase in elastase release,
CD11b expression, and chemotaxis was also inhibited by luteolin (Yang et al. 2018).
Apart from being anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory, luteolin plays an important
role in defending plants, for example against UV radiation, suggesting it could be
useful in skin protection against UV-induced photoaging (Gendrisch et al. 2020).

**22.4.1.5** **Ortho-Vanillin**

ortho-Vanillin (o-Vanillin; 2-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde) is an organic solid
present in the extracts and essential oils of many plants. o-Vanillin is an isomer of
meta-Vanillin, a phenolic aldehyde.
Vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde) that is a major component of the
bean and pod of some plant species of the Vanilla genus, and is also synthesized on a

large scale for use as a flavoring agent in food, fragrance and pharmaceutical industries. Vanillin exhibits antioxidant, antimicrobial, analgesic, anti-carcinogenic, antimutagenic and anti-sickling biological effects (Marton et al. 2016). o-Vanillin cleared
senescent intervertebral disc (IVD) cells and reduced the senescence-associated
secretory phenotype (SASP) (see Sect. 22.5) associated with inflammation and back
pain. It also increased metabolic activity, caspase 3/7 activity, and apoptosis in cells
from degenerate IVDs, but not in cells from non-mildly-degenerate IVDs (Cherif
et al. 2019). o-vanillin exerts its actions through increased pro-apoptotic pathways
and reduction of expression of senescence-associated genes. (Cherif et al. 2020). The
vanillin analogues o-vanillin and 2,4,6- trihydroxybenzaldehyde were also shown to
be cytotoxic against cultured human melanoma A375 cells, and are therefore being
evaluated as potential anticancer drugs (Marton et al. 2016).

**22.4.1.6** **Piperlongumine**

Long pepper ( *Piper longum L.* ), commonly known as “Pippali”, is a pepper plant
found in India and southeast Asia, that contains a vast number of health promoting
compounds. Piperine and piperlongumine are its two major piperidone alkaloids
(Yadav et al. 2020). Piperlongumine (also called piplartine or piperlongumin) has
many pharmacological activities and is commonly used in Ayurvedic medicine
(Bezerra et al. 2013). Piperlongumine has been shown to exert senolytic activity
(Wang et al. 2016) with at least 172 different senolytic targets. One of them is
oxidation resistance 1 (OXR1), an important antioxidant protein that regulates the
expression of a variety of antioxidant enzymes and provides senescent cells with high
resistance to oxidative stress. Piperlongumine induced OXR1 degradation through
the ubiquitin–proteasome system in a senescent cell-specific manner (Zhang et al.
2018). Among other relevant targets, piperlongumine can also bind to annexin A1
(ANXA1), an endogenous anti-inflammatory mediator with therapeutic potential in
cancer (Henrique et al. 2020).

**22.4.1.7** **Quercetin**

Quercetin is a polyphenolic flavonoid, chemically known as 2-(3,4dihydroxyphenyl)-3,5,7-trihydroxychromen-4-one, that is enriched in apples,
berries, broccoli, cabbage, capers, cauliflower, cherries, citrus fruits, coriander,
honey, nuts, red onions, tea, etc. (Batiha et al. 2020).
Quercetin was the first nutritional compound shown to have senolytic activity,
and it was most effective against senescent human endothelial cells and mouse bone
marrow mesenchymal stem cells. Quercetin was found to lack senolytic efficacy in
senescent preadipocytes and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, but when combined with
the anticancer drug Dasatinib, it was shown to be effective as senolytic in several
types of senescent cells (Zhu et al. 2015).

472 J. O. Nehlin

In animal models, a senolytic cocktail of Dasatinib and quercetin (see also
Sect. 22.4.2), which caused the elimination of senescent cells from adipose tissue,
resulted in improved physical function and lifespan extension (Xu et al. 2018).
A clinical trial of Quercetin (Q) and Dasatinib (D) (a pharmaceutical senolytic;
see Sect. 22.4.2) reduced the senescence burden in individuals with diabetic kidney
disease (Hickson et al. 2019). Quercetin together with fisetin are considered as potentially useful adjuvants chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of cancers, in view
of their roles in modulating many cancer signalling pathways (Kashyap et al. 2019).
The senolytic drug combination, D+Q, is known to reduce senescent cell abundance
in aged mice, extending lifespan (Xu et al. 2018). D+Q senolytic treatment also has
been shown to reduce intestinal senescence and inflammation while altering specific
microbiota signatures (Saccon et al. 2021). A summary of the in vivo evidence of
D+Q targeting multiple age-associated dysfunctions and pathologies in mammals,
has been presented (Morsli and Bellantuono 2021).

**22.4.1.8** **Sulforaphane**

The isothiocyanate sulforaphane (SF) is one of the most potent naturally occurring
Phase 2 enzymes inducers derived from *Brassica* vegetables like broccoli, cabbage,
brussel sprouts, etc. (Yuanfeng et al. 2021). Sulforaphane-induced cell cycle arrest,
senescence by upregulation of cell cycle inhibitors p21 and p27, DNA hypomethylation and changes in microRNA profile in breast cancer cells (Lewinska et al. 2017).
Another compound from cruciferous vegetables, Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC)
modulates the senescence effectors p16, p53, and p21, and induces increased staining
of senescence-associated SA-β-Gal senescence biomarker (Malavolta et al. 2018).

**22.4.1.9** **Other Senolytic Compounds Based on Natural Products**

Novel senolytic compounds were searched from natural products using chemoinformatic tools. Hinokitiol found in the roots of the Hinoki tree, preussomerin C
from the *Lasiodiplodia theobromae* fungus, and tanshinone from *Salvia miltiorrhiza*
Bunge roots, could be considered senolytic compound candidates since they share
similarities in structure with senolytic leads such as tunicamycin, ginsenoside Rb1,
ABT-737, rapamycin, navitoclax, timosaponin A-III, digoxin, roxithromycin, and
azithromycin, and targets involved in senescence pathways with potential use in the
treatment of age-related diseases (Barrera-Vazquez et al. 2021). An extract from
the plant *Solidago virgaurea subsp. alpestris*, also known as goldenrod, is traditionally used as an anti-inflammatory herbal medicine, and was shown to exhibit weak
senolytic activity (Lammermann et al. 2018).
Triptolide (TPL) is a diterpenoid extracted from the plant, *Tripterygium wilfordii*
*Hook F*, which is a traditional Chinese medicinal herb. Bioactive TPL showed
immunosuppressive, anti-fertility and anti-cystogenesis activities. TPL accelerated
liver cancer cell line HepG2 cell senescence by regulating the AKT pathway. TPL

could also enhance cellular senescence and inhibit tumor growth by negatively regulating human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) signaling pathway (Li et al.
2017).
Senotherapeutics have also been identified in marine dietary algae such
as (2R*, 3S*, 6R*, 7S*, 10R*, 13R*)-7,13-Dihydroxy-2,6-cyclo-1(9),14xenicadiene-18,19-dial derived from *Dilophus fasciola*, Laurendecumenyne A
from *Laurencia decumbens* and 4-Bromo-3-ethyl-9-[(2E)- 2-penten-4-yn-1-yl]-2,8dioxabicyclo[5.2.1]decan-6-ol from *Laurencia sp.* to be potent inhibitors of multiple
target senescent-cell anti-apoptotic pathway proteins (Salekeen et al. 2021).
###### ***22.4.2 Pharmaceutical Senolytics***

Pharmaceutical senolytics are compounds that have been chemically synthesized
and that, originally, were used as experimental cancer drugs. Cancer cells avoid
apoptosis and can undergo tumorigenesis, in part by upregulation of pro-survival
proteins of the Bcl-2 protein family (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, and A1). Upon
further investigation, some of the cancer drugs were found to target senescent cells
in tumors, such as navitoclax (previously called ABT-263) that targets Bcl-2, Bcl-xl,
and Bcl-w (Zhu et al. 2016; Prasanna et al. 2021). Combinations of pharmaceutical
senolytics (e.g. Dasatinib) and nutritional senolytics (e.g. quercetin) have proven
very effective in anti-senescent cell elimination (Saccon et al. 2021; Morsli and
Bellantuono 2021). These findings have triggered further work to try to repurpose
other existing pharmaceuticals to target aging pathways (Vaiserman et al. 2021).
Since pharmaceutical senolytics are drugs, that are not present in nutrients or
foods, they will not be addressed specifically in this chapter. ***22.4.3 Other Senolytic Strategies***

The present work is focused exclusively on nutritional factors affecting senescent cells, however, many non-nutritional approaches are being considered as well,
to influence and/or erradicate senescent cells. Examples include exercise (Chen
et al. 2021b), fibrates (Nogueira-Recalde et al. 2019), hyperbaric oxygen therapy
(Hachmo et al. 2020), chemically-based prodrugs such as a non-toxic derivative of
the compound 5-Fluorouridine, a senescence-specific killing compound 1 (SSK1)
derived from the drug gemcitabine targeting lysosomal beta-galactosidase (Cai
et al. 2020), galactose-modified cytotoxic prodrugs such as Duocarmycin (Guerrero et al. 2020), cardiac glycosides targeting the Na [+] /K [+] ATPase pump such as
digoxin, in combination with senogenic compounds Gemcitabine or Doxorubicin
(Triana-Martinez et al. 2019; Martin et al. 2020), inhibitors of the HSP90 chaperone family such as 17-Dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin
(17-DMAG) (Fuhrmann-Stroissnigg et al. 2017), a FOXO4 peptide that perturbs


-----

474 J. O. Nehlin

the FOXO4 interaction with p53 (Baar et al. 2017), CD153 vaccination to remove
senescent T cells (Yoshida et al. 2020), etc.
Finally, the role of senescent cell eradication by the immune system (Prata et al.
2018; Kale et al. 2020) and nanomaterial-based delivery systems capable of preferentially killing senescent cells (nano-senolytics) and/or modulating their proinflammatory secretome (nano-senomorphics/nano-senostatics) are areas of active research
(Adamczyk-Grochala and Lewinska 2020).
###### **22.5 Gerosuppressors and Senomorphics**

Gerosuppressors, also called senomorphics, are compounds or biomedical strategies
thatsuppress,ameliorate,preventorreversethesenescentstate,inhibitingorreducing
senescence-inducing triggers such as telomere damage, stress-induced senescence
and gene-induced senescence (Martel et al. 2020). Senescent cells exhibit a characteristic secretory profile. This specific secretome is being currently referred to as the
“Senescence-associated secretory phenotype” or SASP (Coppe et al. 2008; Kuilman
and Peeper 2009). Many different types of compounds and strategies can inhibit or
modulate the SASP, including medicines such as statins (Liu et al. 2015), glucocorticoids (Laberge et al. 2012), JAK1/2 inhibitors such as Ruxolitinib (Xu et al.
2015), NF-kB, p38 MAP kinase and MK2 kinase inhibitors (Alimbetov et al. 2016),
splicing factor PTBP1 depletion (Georgilis et al. 2018), transgenic cells seeking IL-6
producing senescent cells (Qudrat et al. 2017), etc. Several senomorphic molecules,
at an early characterization stage, have been recently presented (Mongelli et al. 2020).
The SASP is important to study because it is the origin of the heightened proinflammatory environment normally found in aged people. Thus, senotherapeutics targeting or modulating the SASP are emerging as alternative therapies to the
senolytics (Birch and Gil 2020).
The SASP has been found to be senescence-process specific and cell-type specific,
which means that no individual senescent cell would show the exact same secretome

profile and the secretome changes over time (Basisty et al. 2020; Schafer et al. 2020).
The senolytic compounds described in Sect. 22.4 can also exert modulation of
SASP, to various degrees, and will not be addressed in this section, as their main
function is to have senolytic activity.
Below, a list of prominent nutritional gerosuppressors (in alphabetical order) aims
to describe their origin, targets and possible uses in senotherapy. ***22.5.1 Apigenin***

Apigenin (4 [′],5,7,-trihydroxyflavone) is a flavonoid found in certain herbs, fruits, and
vegetables (Cannataro et al. 2021; Jantan et al. 2021). Apigenin has multiple healthpromoting effects and therapeutic functions (Salehi et al. 2019; Jantan et al. 2021). It

caninhibitUV-inducedcytotoxicityandpreventsignsofskinaginginvivo(Choietal.
2016), Apigenin can attenuate inflammation, which is associated with many chronic
diseases of aging. It was shown to strongly inhibit the secretion of IL-6, a prominent
cytokine expressed by senescent cells (Laberge et al. 2012). Apigenin suppressed the
SASP in three human fibroblast strains induced to senescence by ionizing radiation,
constitutive MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling, oncogenic RAS,
or replicative exhaustion. The mechanism involves suppression of IL-1α signaling
through IRAK1 and IRAK4, p38-MAPK, and NF-κB. Expression and secretion of
one SASP factor, CXCL10 (IP10), was strongly inhibited by apigenin. Apigenin is a
promising natural product for reducing the impact of senescent cells on age-related
diseases such as cancer (Perrott et al. 2017).
Apigenin is an inhibitor of NAD+ase CD38 enzyme (Escande et al. 2013).
Declining tissue nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) levels are linked to aging
and its associated diseases. Pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages express high
levels of the NAD-consuming enzyme CD38 (Covarrubias et al. 2020) and targeting
NAD [+] metabolism has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach to ameliorate
aging-related disease (Covarrubias et al. 2021).
###### ***22.5.2 Avenanthramide***

Oats are whole grains that contain several nutrients that modulate directly the innate
and adaptive immunity, and indirectly, elicit changes in the gut microbiota and related
metabolites (Chen et al. 2021a). One of the oat’s nutrients, avenanthramide C (Avn
C), was validated as a new senomorphic compound, acting as an inhibitor of SASP
and causing a reduction in the levels of markers of senescence. Avn C inhibited the
activities of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase,
and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Avn C-induced inhibition of the SASP
is triggered by senescence-related stress (Lim et al. 2020). ***22.5.3 Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate***

Green tea ( *Camellia sinesis L.* ) is widely known for its anti-cancer and antiinflammatory properties. Its main antioxidant agents are catechins and derivatives
including epicatechin, epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate and epigallocatechin-3gallate (EGCG). EGCG has potent health properties, among which is the prevention of several types of cancer (Musial et al. 2020). EGCG is also present in
smaller amounts in fruits like apple and plums, onions, hazelnuts, pecans and
carob (Haytowitz et al. 2018). EGCG was able to extend the lifespan in obese
rats by improving free fatty acids metabolism and reducing the levels of inflammatory molecules and oxidative stress (Yuan et al. 2020). In 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes,
induced to senescence, EGCG could diminish IL-6 protein expression and CDKN1a

(p21) mRNA expression, and increase mitochondrial SIRT3 and NRF2 mRNA
expression. SIRT3 activating compounds, such as EGCG, may delay senescence
of cells and senescence-induced inflammatory processes (Lilja et al. 2020). EGCG
downregulated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and AMPK signaling pathway and suppressed
ROS, iNOS, Cox-2, NF-kB, SASP and p53-mediated cell cycle inhibition in preadipocytes, and suppressed the accumulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in senescent cells thereby promoting apoptosis-mediated cell death. EGCG acts as an mTOR
inhibitor, SASP modulator as well as a potential senolytic agent thereby indicating its
multi-faceted attributes that could be useful for developing anti-aging or age-delaying
therapies (Kumar et al. 2019).
###### ***22.5.4 Ginsenoside F1***

Ginseng has been used as a traditional herb in Asian countries for thousands of
years, and contains a large number of active ingredients including steroidal saponins,
protopanaxadiols, and protopanaxatriols, collectively known as ginsenosides (Ratan
et al. 2021). Ginsenoside F1 is a ginsenoside found in Panax species that grow in
the mountainous regions of East Asia. Ginsenoside F1 suppresses the SASP from
astrocytes induced by D-galactose via suppressing p38MAPK-dependent NF-κB
activity (Hou et al. 2018). ***22.5.5 Metformin***

Metformin (dimethylbiguanide) has become the preferred first-line oral blood
glucose-lowering agent to manage type 2 diabetes. *Galega officinalis* (also known as
goat’s rue), a traditional herbal medicine in Europe, was found to be rich in guanidine,
and shown to lower blood glucose. Guanidine derivatives, including metformin, were
synthesized and some (not metformin) were used to treat diabetes in the 1920s and
1930s but were discontinued due to toxicity and the increased availability of insulin
(Bailey 2017). Subsequent research led to the discoveries that metformin can improve
nutrientsensing,enhanceautophagyandintercellularcommunication,protectagainst
macromolecular damage, delay stem cell aging, modulate mitochondrial function,
regulate transcription, and reduce telomere attrition and senescence (Kulkarni et al.
2020). Specifically for aging, metformin leads to decreased insulin levels, decreased
IGF-1 signalling, inhibition of mTOR, inhibition of mitochondrial complex 1 in the
electron transport chain and reduction of endogenous production of reactive oxygen
species (ROS), activation of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), and reduction in DNA
damage (Barzilai et al. 2016) and many more (Morsli and Bellantuono 2021). A large
study known as “Targeting aging by metformin” (TAME) is a trial including more
than 3000 individuals, ages 65–79, where the effects of metformin on the progression
of heart disease, cancer and dementia will be monitored (Kulkarni et al. 2020).

###### ***22.5.6 Puerarin***

Plants from the genus Pueraria are well known for the health and cosmetic benefits.
The medicinally important plants of this genus are commonly known as kudzu,
and the predominant phytochemical constituents are isoflavones, also known as
phytoestrogens (Wang et al. 2020).
Puerarin (daidzein-8-C-glucoside) is a major isoflavone found in *Pueraria lobata*
(Kudzu, Kuzu, Gegen), an edible legume. It possesses a variety of pharmacological
actions (Ahmad et al. 2020, Bharti et al. 2020). Tuber and leaf extracts of Pueraria
tuberosa contain several bioactive constituents such as daidzein, genistein, quercetin,
irisolidone, biochanin A, biochanin B, isoorientin, and mangiferin, which possess
an extensive range of pharmacological activities (Bharti et al. 2020). It can prevent
the aging-phenotype of human dermal fibroblasts Puerarin blocks aging phenotype
in cultured human dermal fibroblasts (Kamiya et al. 2021). ***22.5.7 Rapamycin (Sirolimus) and Rapalogues***

Rapamycin is not a nutritional gerosuppressor but originates from a natural source. It
is one of the most studied senotherapeutics to date. The compound was isolated from
*Streptomyces hygroscopicus*, a bacteria found in a soil sample at Rapa Nui, Easter
island. Initially, it was known as having antifungal activities (called sirolimus), but
later on it was found to have immunosuppressive and antiproliferative properties,
so it was used successfully to reduce organ rejection with kidney transplantation.
Its roles in cancer suppression led to the discovery that rapamycin is an inhibitor
of the mammalian / mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and is one of the few
drugs that is able to extend lifespan in several organisms (Seto 2012, Selvarani et al.
2020). A summary of the in vivo evidence for Rapamycin targeting multiple ageassociated dysfunctions and pathologies in mammals has been reviewed (Morsli and
Bellantuono 2021).
mTOR is a key component of cellular metabolism that integrates nutrient sensing
with cellular processes that fuel cell growth and proliferation, playing a central role in
theregulationoftheagingprocessandlifespan(Papadopolietal. 2019).Theeffectsof
rapamycinonvariousmetabolicpathwayshavebeensummarized(MorsliandBellantuono 2021). The low bioavailability of rapamycin led to the design of rapamycin
analogues, called “rapalogues”, such as mTOR inhibitors temsirolimus (CCI-779),
everolimus (RAD001), and ridaforolimus/deforolimus (MK-8669/AP23573), by
chemical design. Rapalogues have a safer toxicity profile but still exhibit a number of
drawbacks (Viana et al. 2018). Second generation rapalogues, dual mTOR and PI3K
inhibitors, mTORC1 and mTORC2 dual inhibitors, have been designed and await
further characterization (Leontieva et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2011). Several polyphenols have been found to inhibit or influence mTOR, such as honokiol, curcumin (see
Sect. 22.4.1.2), epigallocatechin-3-gallate (see Sect. 22.5.3), theaflavin digallate,

quercetin (see Sect. 22.4.1.7), punicalagin, fisetin (see Sect. 22.4.1.3), oleoeuropein
(see Sect. 22.5.9) and resveratrol (see Sect. 22.5.8) (Pazoki-Toroudi et al. 2016;
Kumar et al. 2019).
###### ***22.5.8 Resveratrol and Resveralogues***

Resveratrol is a non-flavonoid polyphenol stilbenoid (3,5,4 [′] -trihydroxy- *trans* stilbene) and phytoalexin produced by plants in response to injury e.g. UV or
pathogen attack, and is often found in grapes, raisins, berries and peanuts. Resveratrol has the ability to remove ROS, inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX), and trigger
anti-inflammatory pathways via SIRT1 activation. Multiple studies show that resveratrol can suppress SASP. However, lifespan extension has yet not been confirmed
(Grinan-Ferre et al. 2021).
Epigenetic modifications are associated with genome stability, gene transcription,
and metabolic regulation. Acetylation is one of the most characterized histone modifications. Histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes
control the levels of histone acetylation, modulating gene expression (Cavalli and
Heard 2019). Sirtuins (SIRT) 1–7 are enzymes classified as class III HDACs.
A recent work presented ongoing clinical trials using resveratrol as well as other
phytochemicals stimulating SIRT1 activity (Iside et al. 2020). The parent resveratrol molecule has been modified to give rise to at least 24 different “resveralogues”,
structurally related to resveratrol. Replacement of the 3,5-dihydroxy substituents
with 3,5-dimethoxy groups significantly enhances SIRT1 activity, and reduces toxicity. At 100 μM many of the compounds, including resveratrol, induce senescence in
primary human fibroblast MRC5 cells in culture. However, at lower concentrations
(10 μM), most compounds rescued subpopulations of cells within the culture from
senescence (Birar et al. 2020). ***22.5.9 Secoiridoids***

Iridoids are cyclopentane [c] pyran monoterpenoids present in plants and insects,
considered as defensive compounds. Cleavage of a bond in the cyclopentane ring
leads to the formation of a subclass known as secoiridoids, bioactive compounds
with a large variety of pharmacological properties including anti-diabetic, antiinflammatory, immunosuppressive, neuroprotective, anti-cancer and anti-obesity.
The olive tree *Olea europaea L.* is particularly rich in oleuropein (OL), dimethylOL, and ligstroside secoiridoids, and their hydrolysis derivatives are mostly OLaglycone, oleocanthal (OLE), oleacein (OLA), elenolate, oleoside-11-methyl ester,
elenoic acid, hydroxytyrosol (HTy), and tyrosol (Ty) (Castejon et al. 2020). The
presence of OLE and OLA in extra-virgin olive oil has been investigated in relation
to healthy aging (Nikou et al. 2019). OLE and ligstroside have been found to protect


-----

22 Gerosuppressive and Senolytic Nutrients 479

against mitochondrial dysfunction in models of Alzheimer’s disease and brain aging
(Grewal et al. 2020).
###### **22.6 Other Nutritional and Dietary Interventions** ***22.6.1 Geroprotectors***

Many natural products do not necessarily fall into the categories of senolytics and
gerosuppressors per se, but exert their health-promoting and anti-aging activities as
contributors to protect cellular integrity. A geroprotector is a compound that protects
the integrity of cellular structures and macromolecules. Several gerosuppressors that
modulate the SASP can also act as geroprotectors, such as rapamycin and metformin
(Morsli and Bellantuono 2021).
Nutraceutical compounds encompassing phytochemicals, probiotic bacteria and
omega-3-fatty acids have shown promising anti-immunosenescence and anti-cellular
senescence potential in immune cell (Sharma and Padwad 2020).
There are many nutritional anti-aging compounds **.** Anti-carcinogenic, antiinflammatory, anti-viral, anti-microbial, anti-proliferative and antioxidant activities
can be found in many phytochemicals, that either directly or indirectly can be consideredgeroprotective. Examples arefoundintheCitrus family(oranges, lemons, grapefruits, etc.) (Barreca et al. 2020), foods in the Mediterranean diet (Cannataro et al.
2021), edible flowers (Zheng et al. 2021), honey (Jaganathan and Mandal 2009),
olive oils (Nikou et al. 2019), mushrooms (Abdelshafy et al. 2021), cocoa (Martin
and Ramos 2021), etc.
Alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG), an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle that
leads to energy production, biosynthesis of certain amino acids, collagen biosynthesis, epigenetic regulation of gene expression, regulation of redox homeostasis,
and detoxification of hazardous substances, can extend lifespan and delay the onset
of age-associated decline in experimental animal models, and is being considered a
geroprotective drug (Bayliak and Lushchak 2021).
Nicotinamide (NAM) is a form of vitamin B 3 found mainly in meat, fish, cereals,
nuts, and mushrooms, as well as to a lesser extent in some vegetables and used
as a dietary supplement and medication. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) is a
nucleotide derivative of niacin (one of three forms of vitamin B 3 ). NMN is a precursor
of NAD+, an important cofactor in redox reactions in energy metabolism. Aging is
accompanied by a gradual decline in tissue and cellular NAD [+] levels in multiple
model organisms, including rodents and humans. Therefore, supplementation with
NMN is geroprotective (Covarrubias et al. 2021).

###### ***22.6.2 Epigenetic Modifiers***

Very few studies have yet explored the role of specific nutrients in epigenetic modification to achieve rejuvenation as a means of anti-aging strategies. One recent study
has shown that a 1-year Mediterranean-like diet, in a pilot study of elderly healthy
subjects from the NU-AGE study (60 Italians, 60 Poles), resulted in epigenetic
rejuvenation (Gensous et al. 2020).
In the trial “Thymus Regeneration, Immunorestoration, and Insulin Mitigation”
(TRIIM), nine healthy men were given a cocktail of human growth hormone (hGH),
metformin, dehydroepidandrosterone (DHEA), vitamin D3, and zinc for 1-year, that
shed about 2.5 years off their biological ages, according to an analysis of their
epigenome. (Fahy et al. 2019; Bartke et al. 2021) (Fig. 22.1). **22.7 Concluding Remarks and Future Perspectives**

The nutritional geroscience field is relatively young. The impact that
pharmacologically-synthesized senomorphics and dietary components, alone or in
combination, might have on the short- and long-term survival and secretory function of senescent cells awaits further characterization. The cellular and systemic


-----

22 Gerosuppressive and Senolytic Nutrients 481

divergence of phytochemical targets suggests that the best way to assess the contribution of individual nutrients or compounds, alone or in combination, is to design
long-term longitudinal clinical trials, whereby individuals of different genetic backgrounds, lifestyles and environments, are followed to assess health outcomes, disease
emergence, duration of health span and lifespan.
Senescent cells arise by means of different processes, and their resulting SASP
profiles will undoubtedly be heterogenous. It is therefore expected that their response
to senolytics and senomorphic compounds will vary. Clinical intervention studies
will be needed to understand the precise contribution of single or combined dietary
phytochemicals, to the rate of aging in each one of the aging trajectories that lead to
specific age-associated diseases and their accompanying disabilities.
It is becoming more evident that most of the compounds tested to date, that have
anti-senescence phenotype properties, have multiple targets, and their use might
influence cells and body processes other than only senescent cells. This implies that
safety issues need to always be considered when administering senotherapeutics,
including estimation of the senescence burden of an individual before any clinical
intervention.

The significance of hormesis to the use of senotherapeutics will require understanding the effects of different doses, frequency and time of administration (Santoro
et al. 2020; Rattan 2008).
The list of natural compounds that can exert senolytic and senomorphic activities
is likely to grow in the years to come, some of which could have novel targets on
pre-senescent and senescent cells. It is important to assess the chemical structure
of the natural compound including its modifications such as glycosylation, etc. that
could have implications for their activities in vivo, implying that chemical synthesis
of the basic structure of the compounds alone may not be sufficient to result in fully
active senotherapeutics (Huang et al. 2016).
Finally, it would be ideal to investigate the role of natural and synthetic compounds
on non-senescent cells, at all stages of their lives, that could help to delay senescence
and improve resilience, without significantly compromising basic body function. The
pursuit of an extended health span by means of dietary interventions would facilitate
health care and reduce or postpone disease burden among the elderly.

##### **Chapter 23**
#### **Role of Short Peptides as an Important** **Nutritional Element in Maintenance** **of Body Homeostasis**

**Svetlana V. Trofimova and Vladimir Kh. Khavinson**

**Abstract** This book chapter outlines the physiological and molecular mechanisms
of metabolism of short peptides as well as its role in maintenance of homeostasis.
Many of short peptides for oral use do not decompose in the gastrointestinal tract and
absorb unchanged. Such peptides, which do not hydrolyze in a gastrointestinal tract,
get to a blood plasma and then to various tissues and organs. Short peptides permeate
through cytoplasmic membrane into the nucleus and nucleolus of a cell, where they
able to bind to DNA an to regulate gene expression epigenetically. Interaction DNApeptide probably is the earliest evolution form. It gives explanation of high biological
activity and absolute safety of short peptides, and its’ successful use in form of
substance endowed with significant physiological effect.

###### **23.1 Introduction**

Numerous studies on regulatory peptides in recent decades have led to a reexamination of ideas about regulation mechanisms of physiological functions, maintenance of homeostasis processes and adaptation of the body’s functional systems
to the environment. Nutrition is one of the most important environmental factors
that affect the human body throughout its life. Nutrients, being converted through
metabolism, ensure the body’s vital activity, affecting the quality and duration of
life. Eating disorders always lead to some kind of negative consequences. Therefore,
various pathological processes in the human body, as well as aging processes, can
be considered from the point of view of disorders in the metabolism of nutrients at
the organ, tissue and cellular level of the organization of living matter. S. V. Trofimova ( B ) · V. Kh. Khavinson ( B )

Inthisregard,arationaldietadequatetoage,professionalactivity,andhealthstatus
is considered as the most important factor in the prevention of most age-associated
human diseases.

Modern nutritional science considers two aspects: the epidemiology of nutrition
(correlations between the characteristics of national nutrition and the presence of
metabolic pathology in people from different countries) and the biochemical transformation of nutrients in the body (intake of biologically active substances with food,
i.e. signaling molecules). From the point of view of molecular biology, information
on the metabolic status of an organism is contained in the oldest (intracellular) and
evolutionarily younger systems of regulation (nervous, immune, and endocrine),
the functional activity of which is carried out through signaling molecules. These
molecules carry out epigenetic regulation of gene expression to solve the general
problems of the body’s adaptation to changes in the supply of nutrients from the
environment.

Alargenumberofscientificworksaredevotedtothestudyofthepharmacokinetics
of various biological substances when they are administered orally (Bai et al. 1995;
Diao and Meibohm 2013; Vargas-Bello-Pérez et al. 2019). Among them, the study of
their epigenetic activity has taken the leading place in recent years. Thus, according to
a number of authors, it has been established that fatty acids and amino acids entering
the blood and various tissues can interact with cellular targets (membrane and nuclear
structures) and epigenetically regulate gene expression and protein synthesis (Ryan
and Seeley 2013; Boyko et al. 2007). Among the signaling molecules necessary to
maintain homeostasis in the body, a special group is made up of regulatory peptides of
exogenous and endogenous origin (Anisimov and Khavinson 2010; Liu et al. 2016).
###### **23.2 Biology of Endogenous Polypeptides**

The functions of endogenous polypeptide molecules (growth factors, pancreatic
polypeptide, calcitonin, angiotensin, peptide hormones of the hypothalamus, etc.)
in the regulation of metabolism and neuro-immune-endocrine interactions are well
studied. In recent years, more and more attention of scientists has been attracted to
short peptides formed by the degradation of proteins that enter the body with food.
A growing body of evidence indicates that regulatory oligopeptides are involved
in the processes of growth, development, and regeneration (Khavinson et al. 2020;
Sinjari et al. 2020; Khavinson et al. 2011a). Many of them are well-studied structures that regulate various physiological functions of the body. It is assumed that at
the level of oligopeptides there is a unified system of regulation of both embryonic,
growth, regeneration types and the functioning of the formed organism (Khavinson
et al. 2019, 2021; Caputi et al. 2019). Thus, intensive studies of regulatory peptides
have led to a radical re-examination of ideas about the regulation mechanisms of
physiological functions and the principles of homeostasis process coordination in
functional systems of the body.

23 Role of Short Peptides as an Important Nutritional Element … 493

It is known that the intestinal regulatory systems carry out the transport of peptides
formed from proteins during digestion much faster than the absorption of a free amino
acid mixture, to which the body did not adapt during evolution. The small intestine
has di- and tripeptide transporters providing absorption of short peptides (Bai et al.
1995; Shen et al. 2001). The rate of transport of some dipeptides exceeds the rate
of transport of those amino acids of which they are composed. Peptidases of the
enterocyte brush border cleave a significant part (about 40–60%) of short peptides
only to di- and tripeptides.
However, with age, in various parts of the digestive tract, there is a steady increase
in involutional processes that contribute to the disruption of formation and absorption
of short peptides, which ultimately leads to a violation of the adaptation processes
and homeostasis of the functional systems of the entire organism.
All these data served as the basis for the development of biologically active food
supplements based on short peptides. The most famous and “oldest” short peptide
on the pharmaceutical market in the world is the dipeptide carnosine (β-Ala-His)
(Mendelson 2008;Deraveetal. 2019;Boldyrevetal. 2013).So,accordingtoresearch,
oral administration of carnosine has an antioxidant effect, affecting lipid peroxidation
products, oxygen anions and other free radicals. It reduces their number to the level
necessary for the full functioning of the signaling systems, which has a positive effect
on the body’s functions (Liu et al. 2016). An example of another mild peptide is the
Asn-Leu-Pro-Arg (NLPR) peptide, which has neurotrophic effects. It was established
that oral administration of the tetrapeptide Asn-Leu-Pro-Arg (NLPR) in rats with
weakened memory is accompanied by an increase in susceptibility and presence of a
behavioral response, and also enhances expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) in
the brain. It is assumed that NLPR can improve memory by initiating the expression
of NGF, i.e. is a potential drug candidate for treatment of memory impairment (Zhou
et al. 1994).
A significant contribution to the study of the action mechanism of short peptides
was made by studies carried out at the St. Petersburg Institute of Bioregulation and
Gerontology, where various short peptides involved in maintaining the structural and
functional homeostasis of cell population were synthesized and studied (Khavinson
2014). Among these peptides are short peptides Regevil (Vilon, Lys-Glu (KE)) and
Epimental (Epitalon Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly (AEDG)) which have a normalizing effect on
the function of the body’s immune and endocrine systems (Anisimov and Khavinson
2010; Khavinson and Malinin 2005). Peptides KE and AEDG have a big spectrum of
biological activity: they increase average and maximum life expectancy, reduce the
incidence of malignant tumors, promote an increase in telomere length, overcome
the Hayflick cell division limit, restore the functional activity of cells of the immune
system and the endocrine system (Sevostianova et al. 2013; Khavinson et al. 2012a;
Anisimov and Khavinson 2010; Khavinson and Malinin 2005). Peptide Lys-GluAsp-Ala (KEDA), which restores the intensity and rhythm of protein synthesis in the
culture of hepatocytes of old rats, is also of interest (Timofeeva et al. 2005).
It should be noted that metabolism of short peptides obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis in the gastrointestinal tract of proteins that enter the body with food and their
synthetic analogs seems to be uniform, therefore the general biological role of short


-----

peptides in the regulation of homeostasis, regardless of their origin, is further examined. The metabolism of short peptides can be divided into 3 main stages: absorption
into the blood in the gastrointestinal tract, interaction with targets of various organs
and tissues, and elimination/resorption in the kidneys.
###### **23.3 Metabolism of Short Peptides in the Gastrointestinal** **Tract and Their Absorption into the Bloodstream**

Protein molecules that enter the body with food, under the action of enzymes of the
gastric (pepsin, rennin, gastrixin) and intestinal (aminopeptidase, enteropeptidase)
tract,aresplitmainlyintodi-andtripeptides.Theseshortpeptidesaredividedintotwo
groups: resistant to hydrolysis and able to break down into amino acids. Hydrolysis
of labile short peptides occurs on the surface of the brush border membranes of
enterocytes (membrane digestion) or inside enterocytes using cytosolic peptidases
(intracellular digestion) (Ugolev et al. 1975; Timofeeva et al. 2005, 2000; Shen et al.
2001).
Peptides resistant to hydrolysis (glycyl-glycine, proline-containing peptides,
glycyl-sarcosine, carnosine, etc.) penetrate into the circulatory system in an
unchanged form, which is confirmed by the data of various researchers (Matthews
and Payne 1975). According to Addison et al. (1975), all dipeptides have the same
transport mechanism from the gastrointestinal tract into the blood. It was established
that the Ala-Gly-Gly (AGG) tripeptide and some dipeptides are not hydrolyzed in
the small intestine and can enter the bloodstream unchanged. In addition, it has been
shown that dipeptides, in particular the Gly-Pro (GP) peptide, can penetrate from
the gastrointestinal tract not only into the bloodstream, but can also be transported
even through the blood–brain barrier in an unchanged form (Boyko et al. 2000). In
another study, it was shown that in addition to passive transfer in the alkaline border
of enterocytes, there is a system of active transport of di- and tripeptides (Dyer et al.
1990).
When studying the morpho-physiological characteristics of the transport of
the cyclic nonapeptide Cys-Tyr-Phe-Gln-Asn-Cys-Pro-Arg-Gly (CYFQNCPRG)
through the intestinal epithelium, its partial absorption also occurred while maintaining physiological activity. The localization of the label to this nonapeptide in
the cytoplasm of enterocytes and the intercellular space in the basal region of the
intestinal epithelium of rats and frogs has been shown using the methods of electron and fluorescence confocal microscopy (Natochin et al. 2004; Prutskova and
Seliverstova 2012).
These data are consistent with the results of studies of short peptides developed
under the guidance of prof. V.Kh. Khavinson. Numerous studies have shown that
short peptides KE, AEDG, KEDA are not hydrolyzed in the stomach, duodenum,
jejunum and ileum, and are only slightly hydrolyzed in the colon and liver. The
degree of hydrolysis of these peptides was determined by cleavage by L-amino acid


-----

oxidase. In addition, it was shown that the KEDA peptide is not subject to hydrolysis
in blood plasma, which confirms the assumption about the possibility of transport of
peptides in the bloodstream to specific target organs for them (Tutelyan et al. 2003;
Timofeeva et al. 2005).
The results showing that the peptides KE, AEDG, KEDA are able to regulate the
activity of digestive enzymes in old animals are important. It was found that oral
administration of the KEDA peptide in old rats for 2 weeks increased the activity of
sucrase and maltase in the duodenum by 60%, maltase in the jejunum and colon by 3
times, and aminopeptidase M and glycyl-L-leucinepeptidase by 2 times (Timofeeva
et al. 2005). The KE peptide in a similar experiment increased the activity of maltase
(by 1.2 times in the duodenum, by 1.5 times in the jejunum, by 1.3 times in the ileum)
and alkaline phosphatase (by 2.2 times in the jejunum). and the ileum and 1, 8 times—
in the duodenum) (Khavinson et al. 2001). It is important to note that the peptides
KEDA and KE promoted an increase in the activity of gastrointestinal enzymes in
old animals to values typical for young animals. In addition, oral administration of
the KE and AEDG peptides for 1 month in aged rats improved the absorption of
glucose and glycine in the medial region under the action of the KE peptide, and in
the proximal and distal parts of the small intestine under the influence of the AEDG
peptide (Khavinson et al. 2002).
###### **23.4 Tissue-Specific and Gene-Specific Interaction of Short** **Peptides with Target Cells in Various Organs**

Through the bloodstream, short peptides penetrate into various organs and tissues.
Probably, short peptides, in accordance with their structure, have an affinity for
certainorgansandtissuesinwhichtheyaccumulateandexhibitthegreatestbiological
activity. It was found that short peptides KE and AEDG have a pronounced tissuespecific effect on the thymus and pineal gland (Anisimov and Khavinson 2010,
Khavinson et al. 2011a). It is assumed that the interaction of short peptides with target
tissues is based on their ability to penetrate the cytoplasmic and nuclear membrane
into the nucleus and nucleolus and interact with DNA, epigenetically regulating the
expression of genes encoding a number of signaling molecules and protein markers of
cell functional activity (differentiation factors, proliferation, apoptosis, transcription)
(Khavinson et al. 2012a; Fedoreeva et al. 2011; Tünnemann et al. 2006; Khavinson
et al. 2011b).
It was found that short peptides synthesized on the basis of the Tat-protein (activator of transcription of the viral genome of human immunodeficiency HIV-1) are
able to penetrate into the cell. These peptides have been combined into the cellpenetrating peptides (CPP) group (Tünnemann et al. 2006). Penetration into the cell
through the membrane is most often characteristic of alkaline peptides containing an
excess of positively charged amino acid residues in the structure. The advantage of


-----

496 S. V. Trofimova and V. Kh. Khavinson

these peptides is that they easily overcome the acidic glycocalyx layer that is adjacent to the cell membrane (Futaki et al. 2003; Duchardt et al. 2007). For synthetic
alkaline and amphiphilic peptides containing several lysine residues in the structure,
the ability not only to penetrate into the cell, but also to form complexes with DNA
and RNA was noted. It was found that the binding of these peptides to DNA leads
to strengthening of its double helix (Kubo et al. 2012).
The direct interaction of the peptide with the membrane is determined by the electrostatic interaction of positively charged side groups of amino acid residues of arginine and lysine with negative carboxyl groups of phosphatidylserine, exposed on the
outer side of the cytoplasmic membrane (Denisov et al. 1998). For negatively charged
(carboxyl) side groups of peptides, the binding sites are positively charged groups
of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Thus, pinocytosis may be
the main mechanism for the penetration of short peptides through the cytoplasmic
membrane.

In addition, it was shown that FITC-labeled short peptides AEDG, Glu-Asp-Arg
(EDR), Lys-Glu-Asp-Gly (KEDG) penetrate the nucleus and nucleolus of HeLa
cells. HeLa cells were incubated with FITC-labeled peptides for 12 h (Fedoreeva
et al. 2011). It is known that the nucleus of euariotic cells has a system of transport
pores (nucleopores) formed by protein complexes nucleoporins. The inner diameter
of nucleopores is about 50 nm; therefore, they are permeable to freely diffusing low
molecular weight substances with a molecular weight of up to 3.5 kDa, which include
short peptides (Ohno et al. 1998). The results obtained make it possible to consider
the possibility of direct interaction of short peptides with DNA. In recent years, the
method of molecular modeling has been increasingly used to analyze nanostructures,
which include short peptides (Sokolova et al. 2012).
Comparison of the spatial arrangement of functional groups on the surface of the
large groove of double-stranded DNA and side groups of regulatory peptides showed
that the AEDG peptide can bind to the complementary DNA site on the promoter
region of the gene, causing local strand separation, and thereby initiating the process
of RNA gene transcription by polymerase II (Khavinson et al. 2012a, b Anisimov
and Khavinson 2010).
The ATTTS sequence complementary to the AEDG peptide was found in the
promoter portions of the Ki67, P53, IL-2, MMP2 and Tram1 genes and telomerase.
It was experimentally proved that the addition of the AEDG peptide to the culture
of human lung fibroblasts induces the expression of the telomerase gene, telomerase
activity, and promotes the elongation of telomeres by 2.4 times (Khavinson and
Malinin 2005).
Activation of gene expression is accompanied by an increase in the number of
cell divisions by 42.5%, which demonstrates overcoming the Hayflick limit of cell
division (Anisimov and Khavinson 2010). In addition, in the pineal gland cell culture
of young and old animals under the influence of the tetrapeptide, an increase in
the synthesis of MMP2 and Ki67 proteins and a decrease in the synthesis of the
proapoptotic protein p53 were observed (Khavinson et al. 2012a, b).
Epigenetics postulates the tissue, subcellular, and age specificity of DNA methylation and indicates that the character of DNA methylation in cancer cells is different

than in normal cells (Fedoreeva et al. 2011). Taking these facts into account, it can be
assumed that the same biologically active short peptide can bind to DNA depending
on the nature of its methylation and will have different effects on gene functions
in different tissues (cells), in the nucleus and mitochondria, in young and old cells,
in normal and malignant cells. Thus, specific (complementary) peptide-DNA interactions can epigenetically control the genetic functions of a cell, and this mechanism probably played an important role at the earliest stages of life and evolution
(Vanyushin and Khavinson 2016).
###### **23.5 Elimination and Resorption of CP in the Kidneys**

The question of whether short peptides are excreted in the urine or resorbed in
the kidneys is still controversial (Bumbaca et al. 2019; Litvin et al. 2019; Shen
et al. 2001). According to some researchers, short peptides resistant to hydrolysis by
gastrointestinal tract enzymes are eliminated in the urine (Timofeeva et al. 2005).
In another work, using confocal microscopy, it was shown that the introduction of
a fluorescently labeled polypeptide into the intestines of rats led to its accumulation in the epithelium vesicles of the proximal renal tubule, which indicates the
role of the kidneys in the metabolism of not only endogenous, but also exogenous
peptides and proteins (Natochin et al. 2005). These data are consistent with the study,
which indicates that the metabolism of peptides with a molecular weight of less than
60 kDa occurs in the proximal renal tubules (Diao and Meibohm 2013). **23.6 Clinical Efficiency of Oral Administration of Dietary** **Supplements Based on Short Peptides**

Long-term experimental studies have shown that under the influence of unfavorable environmental factors, emotional stress, development of age-related pathology,
the process of the body’s main systems’ self-regulation is disturbed, the correction
of which is possible with the help of specific short peptides. In addition, the data
presented in the review that short peptides may be resistant to hydrolysis in the
gastrointestinal tract and blood, as well as epigenetically regulate gene expression,
thereby normalizing metabolism, served as the basis for the development of drugs
and biologically active food supplements based on short peptides (Khavinson 2014;
Khavinson et al. 2019).
Based on the short peptides Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly (AEDG) and Lys-Glu (KE), biologically active food supplements Epimental® (Epitalon) and Regevil® (vilon) have
been developed.
Epimental® (Epitalon) was developed based on the results of an experimental
study of the tetrapeptide Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly. Long-term experimental studies have


-----

498 S. V. Trofimova and V. Kh. Khavinson

shown that Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly regulates metabolic processes in the cells of the
neuroendocrine system, activates antioxidant defense processes, stimulates pineal
and extrapineal melatonin synthesis in EC cells of the stomach and intestines, leading
to optimization of the biorhythms of cortisol secretion and other hormones (Anisimov
et al. 2003; Khavinson and Malinin 2005; Khavinson et al. 2012a; Khavinson 2014;
Khavinson et al. 2011c).
The safety of dietary supplements Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly was confirmed by the results
of a study of its general toxic effect. In the study of acute toxicity, it was found that
a single administration of an Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly solution to animals at a dose 5000
times higher than the therapeutic one recommended for clinical use does not cause
toxic reactions. The study of the subacute and chronic toxicity of Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly
indicates the absence of side effects during its long-term use in doses exceeding the
therapeutic one by 100–1000 times. When assessing the general state of animals,
morphological and biochemical parameters of peripheral blood, morphological state
ofinternalorgans,stateofthecardiovascularandrespiratorysystems,liverandkidney
function, pathological changes in the body were not found. Thus, the absence of a
general toxic effect indicates the safety of using Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly as a biologically
active food supplement in order to maintain the function of the neuroendocrine

system.
Clinical study on the effectiveness of a biologically active food supplement
Epimental® (Epitalon) showed its high efficacy in subjects with conditions caused
by chronic stress factors (Trofimova et al. 2021).
The study involved 560 subjects aged 35 to 68 years (260 men and 300 women)
with conditions after prolonged exposure to occupational or psychoemotional stress,
including those caused by frequent changes in time zones.
Stress is a pathological process, which consists in the formation of a complex of
nonspecificprotective,compensatoryandpathologicalreactionsofthebodythatarise
in response to the action of extreme or pathological stimuli that threaten homeostasis:
pain, hypoxia, hunger, psycho-emotional overstrain and other emergency factors that
lead to changes of the same type in the lymphoid tissue, including the thymus gland,
blood composition, adrenal glands, leading to a change in the biorhythm of hormone
secretion. There are close links between stress and occurrence of physical illness.
Modern experimental and clinical data, based on observations of people and animals,
confirm the results obtained by Hans Selye, the classic of the theory of stress, and
reveal the psychological processes by which emotional reactions to stress can make
a person susceptible to this or another disease.
Recently, more and more often in clinical practice, the cause of disturbances in
the biorhythm of hormone synthesis and related disorders on the part of the autonomic nervous system (insomnia, emotional lability, apathy, etc.) is jet lag disorder, a
mismatch between the human biorhythm and the daytime rhythm, due to the frequent
change of time belts.
The subjects were randomly divided into two groups: tmain and control. The
subjects of the main group (270 people) received dietary supplements Epimental®
(Epitalon), 1 capsule per day with meals for 20 days. The control group included
290 subjects with similar conditions who received a placebo in a similar manner. An

23 Role of Short Peptides as an Important Nutritional Element … 499

informed consent was signed with each study participant in accordance with protocol
No. 7 dated March 5, 2018, approved by the ethics committee of the St. Petersburg
Institute of Bioregulation and Gerontology.
All the subjects were under occupational or psychoemotional stress for a long
time, including 142 people exposed to jet lag, 430 people under occupational
stress caused by extreme psychoemotional stress at work, lack of rest during long
time. The subjects complained of an asthenic state: general weakness, decreased
appetite, headaches, sleep disturbances, increased irritability, apathy, emotional
lability, rapid fatigue, decreased performance, decreased memory and attention,
dizziness, increased sweating, changes in blood pressure.
The effectiveness of the use of dietary supplements Epimental® (Epitalon) was
assessed subjectively, by studying the dynamics of the subjects’ complaints, and
by objective indicators, including the determination of cortisol, adrenocorticotropic
hormone (ACTH) and melatonin levels in the blood serum. The content of melatonin
in the blood was measured twice: in the morning at 9:00 and in the evening at 21:00.
It was found that the use of Epimental® (Epitalon) improved the general condition of patients in the study group. The subjects who received Epimental® (Epitalon)
noted improvements concerning all the following indicators: apathy, emotional
lability, sleep disturbance, rapid fatiguability, decreased performance, and decreased
attention focusing.
While apathy, fatigue, decreased performance were noted during the initial examination in all patients of both groups, then after correction with the Epimental®
(Epitalon) dietary supplement, these complaints decreased in 60–70% of the cases
in patients of the main group. While in the control group, there were no significant
changes, in addition, complaints of emotional lability and decreased concentration of
attention even increased. It should be noted that the regulation of the function of the
neuroendocrine system using Epimental® (Epitalon) contributed to the restoration
of sleep in more than half of the subjects. If during the initial examination 67,4%
of respondents mentioned this complaint, then at the secondary examination there
were 32,2% of patients complaining of the sleep disturbance. In the control group,
no significant changes were recorded.
It must be mentioned that upon repeated examination, all subjective indicators in
patients of the main group significantly differ from those in patients in the control
group. Thus, the complaints of patients, characterizing the state after prolonged
exposure to stress factors, had a positive trend only in the subjects of the main group.
As can be seen from above, the use of Epimental® (Epitalon) in subjects exposed
to prolonged occupational or psycho-emotional stress, including those caused by
frequent changes in time zones, contributed to an improvement in subjective indicators that significantly differed from those before the use of dietary supplements and
from indicators in patients of the control group.
During the initial study of the level of melatonin in the blood of patients of both
groups, it was found that the level of melatonin in the morning (9:00) was decreased
by 1.3 times, the level of melatonin in the evening (21:00) was decreased by 2.3
times compared to the lower limit normal values. After application of Epimental®
(Epitalon), there was a significant increase in the level of melatonin in the morning

(from 6.9 ± 1.1 up to 18.2 ± 1.4 pg/ml) and in the evening (from 35.1 ± 1.3 up to
72.3 ± 3.6 pg/ml) to the lower limit of the reference values. At the same time, in the
subjects of the control group, the indicators of the level of melatonin in the morning
(from 6.3 ± 0.9 up to 7.8 ± 1.1 pg/ml) and in the evening (from 31.4 ± 1.2 up to
37.2 ± 1.9 pg/ml) increased slightly and did not reach the lower limit of the norm.
The use of Epimental® (Epitalon) in patients exposed to prolonged occupational
or psycho-emotional stress contributed to the stabilization of the hormonal status,
which indicates the leveling of maladjustment disorders and catabolic reactions.
The content of cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) before the
examination was noted at the lower limit of the norm, which indicated the depletion
of the reserves of the adrenal cortex. The level of cortisol in the main group was
239.1 ± 18.9 nmol/L, while in control group it was 232.7 ± 20.1 nmol/L; the level
of ACTH is the main group was 12.6 ± 1.0 pg/ml, while in control group—10.9 ±
0.9 pg/ml. Significant difference between these indicators in both groups were not
recorded. After complex treatment with Epimental® (Epitalon), the level of cortisol
and ACTH in the blood plasma returned to normal and was detected in the middle
region of the reference values of these indicators, which is extremely important
for optimizing the body’s response to stress factors. These changes correlated with
improvements in subjective scores. The lack of positive dynamics of the content of
cortisol and ACTH in the blood of the subjects of the control group is noticeable.
Thus, the results of the studies have shown that the use of Epimental® (Epitalon)
dietary supplements to food contributed to the improvement of the neuroendocrine
system of the body, which explains the improvement in the general condition in
patients of the main group. Against the background of the use of dietary supplements
Epimental® (Epitalon), a decrease in complaints of sleep disturbances, headaches,
dizziness, apathy, weakness, rapid fatigueability, decreased performance, emotional
lability, decreased memory and attention, increased sweating, decreased appetite was
noted.

During the use of Epimental® (Epitalon), no side effects, complications and drug
dependence were identified.
The results of a clinical study of Epimental® (Epitalon) dietary supplements allow
us to conclude that Epimental® food supplements have a regulatory effect on the
neuroendocrine system, which allows us to recommend its use in people exposed
to prolonged occupational or psycho-emotional stress, including jet-lag syndrome
caused by frequent change of time zones (Trofimova et al. 2021).
Regevil® (vilon) Lys-Glu (KE **)** was developed based on the results of an experimental study of the Lys-Glu dipeptide (KE). Long-term experimental studies have
shown that peptides have a tissue-specific effect on the cells of those tissues for
which they are specific. According to experimental studies, the Lys-Glu (KE) dipeptide regulates metabolic processes in the cells of the immune system, improves the
indicators of cellular and tissue homeostasis in the cells of the immune system,
restores impaired immunological reactivity, activates antioxidant defense processes,
and stimulates tissue regeneration in the event of their suppression. These properties
of the Lys-Glu (KE) dipeptide are the mechanism of its immunomodulatory and

anti-stress action. (Anisimov and Khavinson 2010; Khavinson and Malinin 2005;
Khavinson 2014; Khavinson et al. 2011d).
The safety of Lys-Glu (KE) dipeptide was confirmed by the results of a study of its
general toxic effect. In the study of acute toxicity, it was found that a single administration of a solution of Lys-Glu (KE) dipeptide to animals in a dose 5000 times higher
than the therapeutic one recommended for clinical use does not cause toxic reactions.
ThestudyofthesubacuteandchronictoxicityoftheLys-Glu(KE)dipeptideindicates
the absence of side effects with its long-term use in doses exceeding the therapeutic
one by 100–1000 times. When assessing the general state of animals, morphological and biochemical parameters of peripheral blood, morphological state of internal
organs, state of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, liver and kidney function,
pathological changes in the body were not detected. Thus, the absence of a general
toxic effect indicates the safety of using Lys-Glu (KE) dipeptide as a biologically
active food supplement in order to maintain the function of the immune system.
AclinicalstudyoftheeffectivenessofthedietarysupplementRegevil®(vilon)has
shown its high efficiency for the complex restoration of the functions of the immune
system in pathological conditions of various origins, including for accelerating tissue
regeneration after various injuries, when exposed to extreme environmental factors,
as well as in elderly and senile people to maintain the functions of the immune system
(Trofimova et al. 2021).
The study involved 520 people aged 43 to 76 years (268 men and 252 women)
during the period of convalescence after suffering acute respiratory, bacterial or viral
diseases.

It is known that various factors of a physical, chemical and biological nature,
depending on the duration or intensity of their impact on the human body, can
lead to depletion of adaptive and compensatory mechanisms and cause profound
disturbances in various links of the immune system.
Pathological disorders in the immune system, as a rule, contribute to a protracted
course of the underlying disease with a tendency to relapse, a decrease in the body’s
resistance to infection and the development of severe complications.
The subjects were randomly divided into two groups: the main and the control.
The subjects of the main group (276 people) received dietary supplements for food
Regevil® (vilon), 1 capsule per day with meals for 20 days. The control group
included 244 people with similar conditions who received a placebo in a similar
manner. An informed consent was signed with each study participant in accordance
with Protocol No. 2 dated January 24, 2018, approved by the Ethics Committee of
the St. Petersburg Institute of Bioregulation and Gerontology.
The effectiveness of the use of dietary supplements to food Regevil® (vilon) was
assessed by the dynamics of complaints of the examined and by a number of objective
indicators: general clinical examination of blood and urine, immunological examination of peripheral blood (the number of T- and B-lymphocytes was determined by the
method of immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies obtained to differentiation antigens of lymphocytes CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20; the content of immunoglobulins of various classes was determined by the method of radial immunodiffusion in
gel according to Mancini; functional activity of T-lymphocytes was determined by

the lymphocyte migration test (LMIT) with ConA). Subjects complained of asthenic
state: general weakness, loss of appetite, headaches, sleep disturbance, increased
irritability, apathy, emotional lability, rapid fatiguability, reduced performance.
The studies have shown that the majority of the surveyed who are in the recovery
period, regardless of the etiology of the disease (viral as a complication after
influenza, acute respiratory infections or pneumococcal), have disorders in the
immune status, manifested in a decrease in the number of CD3+, CD4+ cells with
a slight increase in the number of lymphocytes with the CD8+ phenotype, which
indicates a decrease in the level of immunoreactivity (CD4+/CD8+). The results of
LMIT with ConA characterize a decrease in the functional activity of T-lymphocytes
(mainly CD8+, i.e., T-suppressors/killers). The content of CD20+-cells, representing
a subpopulation of B-lymphocytes, did not significantly differ from normal values,
but, at the same time, an increase in the amount of immunoglobulins M and G in
blood serum was observed.

It should be noted that the quantitative indicators of the content of CD3+ and
CD4+ cells are characteristic of the lower limits of physiological fluctuations in
their number in persons of a given age, which may indicate a depletion of their
immune system. As a rule, persons with a secondary immunodeficiency state had a
pronounced asthenic syndrome and significant changes in the cardiovascular system.
The results of the conducted studies indicate that Regevil® (vilon) is an effective
solution for the correction of secondary immunodeficiencies developing in response
to exposure to extreme factors. The use of Regevil® (vilon) allowed to normalize
the impaired parameters of the immune system in 86% of cases.
The greatest effect from the use of Regevil® (vilon) was observed in relation to
subpopulations of T-lymphocytes and their functional activity: there was a significant
increase in the content of CD3+ and CD4+ lymphocytes to the level of normal
values, with their initial significant decrease, normalization of the CD4+/CD8+ ratio,
a significant decrease in the LMIT index. A less distinct reaction was observed on the
part of the B-system of immunity (CD20+), probably due to its greater conservatism
and insufficient duration of the drug intake, although a tendency to an increase in
the content of B-lymphocytes up to the lower limit of the norm was noted. Attention
is also drawn to a significant increase in the leukocyte content compared with the
indicator before the use of the peptide: initially this indicator was at the lower limit of
the norm (4.6 ± 0.6 × 10 [9] /l), after the course of using the drug, the indicator increased
to optimal values (6.5 ± 0.2 × 10 [9] /l), which indicates a more rapid reversal of the
inflammatory process in the body than in patients of the control group.
The positive dynamics of laboratory indicators was accompanied by a pronounced
improvement in subjective indicators. So, after the course with the use of Regevil®
(vilon), the subjects who had pneumonia noted a significant improvement in their
general condition, leveling of residual effects of bronchial and pulmonary dysfunction (reduction of cough and shortness of breath) and a decrease in the severity of
asthenic syndrome, always accompanying secondary immunodeficiencies caused
an infectious disease. Thus, the obtained results of the study indicate not only
the immunomodulatory effect of the drug, but also its ability to accelerate tissue
regeneration due to the immunostimulating effect.

23 Role of Short Peptides as an Important Nutritional Element … 503

No side effects, complications, contraindications, drug dependence with the use
of Regevil® (vilon) were identified during the clinical study.
Thus, the clinical study carried out has shown that Regevil® (vilon) promotes
the normalization of cellular immunity indicators, stimulates the processes of tissue
regeneration in case of their suppression, does not cause side effects, complications
and drug dependence. The dietary supplement for food Regevil® (vilon) is recommended to be used to accelerate the restoration of the functions of the immune system
after inflammatory diseases of infectious and non-infectious genesis (including after
pneumonia of viral and bacterial etiology), it is also recommended for the older
people to maintain the functional activity of the immune system (Trofimova et al.
2021).
Thus, oral administration of the dietary supplements Epimental® (epitalon)
and Regevil® (vilon), created on the basis of the short peptides Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly
(AEDG) and Lys-Glu (KE), turned out to be effective in clinical research aimed at
maintaining the functional activity of the immune neuroendocrine systems of the
body (Trofimova et al. 2021).
###### **23.7 Conclusion**

Experimentally and clinically demonstrated possibility of oral administration of
drugs based on short peptides is the indication for their preventive and therapeutic
uses. Some of the main characteristics of these short peptides are: their resistance
to the action of enzymes of the gastrointestinal tract and blood plasma; their ability
to activate absorption of various biological substances in the gastrointestinal tract;
and their ability to penetrate into the cytoplasm, nucleus and nucleolus of target cells
of various tissues. Furthermore, interaction of short peptides with DNA and their
effects on the epigenetic regulation of gene expression provides an explanation for
their high biological activity and successful use as substances with physiologically
adequate and potentially geroprotective actions.

**Abstract** Intermittent fasting (IF) is widely practiced for health benefits among
people of various societies by adopting regimens which vary in terms of dietary
patterns and duration of fast. Also, sustained periods of caloric restriction (CR)

lower incidence of metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases,
cancer, and neurological disorders. IF regimens such as alternate day fasting, time
restricted feeding, protein restriction etc. have recently emerged as potential alternate
approaches to CR which do not involve any major changes in quality and quantity of
nutritional intake. This chapter reviews the different regimens of IF and CR used in
model organisms and in humans to ascertain their efficacy for metabolic fitness, resistance to age-related diseases and longevity as well as their underlying molecular and
cellular mechanisms. Moreover, promoting health-oriented and disease preventive
approaches are more viable options for healthy aging and longevity than continuing
with disease-oriented research and therapeutic strategies.

###### **24.1 Introduction**

Biological aging and its underlying molecular and cellular processes cannot be
considered as a disease, and therefore, reorienting the focus of aging research to
health-oriented and disease-preventive strategies is required (Rattan 2014). Amongst
such approaches, dietary restriction (DR) has emerged to be of prime importance in
maintaining and improving mental as well as physical health status in older adults
(Zupo et al. 2020; Currenti et al. 2021). Caloric restriction (CR) refers to a dietary

intervention which recommends an overall 20–40% reduction in daily caloric intake,
whereas, DR is based on a broader scope of dietary interventions that involves
restrictions CR without compromising on the quality of nutrition is an effective nonpharmacological intervention which is reported to promote health span in numerous
non-human species (Weindruch 1996; Ingram et al. 2007; Mattison et al. 2012) as
well as in humans (Fontana et al. 2004, 2010; Fontana and Partridge 2015).
Several clinical trials conducted in the last decade have reported the benefits of
short and prolonged bouts of CR in weight reduction and improvement in several
physiological markers of health(Most et al. 2017, 2018; RedmanandRavussin 2011).
However,longtermimplementationofdailytraditionalCRhaslowersuccessratedue
to poor compliance by individuals (Barte et al. 2010; Scheen 2008). Moreover, ample
availability of energy-rich food and beverages in the present-day societies baffles the
individual’s ability to continue with traditional CR regimen (Swinburn and Egger
2002). Keeping in view the rapid rate of population aging, some innovative and easy
to implement strategies are needed to improve healthspan (Dzau et al. 2019). Intermittent fasting-dietary restriction (IF-DR) regimen based on feeding/fasting timings
manipulation is emerging as an alternative and innovative intervention to promote
healthy aging.
###### **24.2 Efficacy of CR Intervention in Aging**

Aging-associated changes in physiological functions affect the nutrient requirements
of individuals by directly altering their appetite and body weight. Moreover sensory
changes such as loss of taste and smell also reduce caloric intake in the aged people.
Similarly loss of protein and lean body mass (sarcopenia) in old persons is associated
with reduction in energy requirements. Although recent studies suggest that reducing
calorie consumption and maintaining below-average body weight throughout life
does reduce chronic disease load and increases life span, there is scant data available
to confirm the potential beneficial effect of CR, specifically in the older populations.
Also, it will not be appropriate to suggest at this juncture that applying lifelong CR is
the only way to achieve beneficial long term health benefits such as reducing inflammatory markers, and improving metabolic functions. Therefore, additional studies as
well as policy development in this direction are urgently required to establish appropriate nutritional requirements and CR regimens for older adults before making firm
recommendations for this population.
After the initial report by McCay showing that CR intervention can extend
lifespan in rats, several studies have reported robust potential of CR in delaying
age-related impairments and lifespan extension in humans (McDonald and Ramsey
2010; Anderson and Weindruch, 2012). The applicability and efficacy of CR as an
aging intervention and lifespan extension have also been studied in detail in nonhuman primates. A significant improvement in morbidity and mortality was reported
with 25% daily CR in adult monkeys (Colman et al. 2009). The efficacy of CR in
primates has been found to be dependent on the age of CR onset as in the young

onset animals, CR failed to show any survival advantage. Moderate CR onset in adult
primates delayed the onset of age-associated pathologies and significant lifespan
extension. Moreover, timing of onset of CR also requires consideration of its negative impact on reproductive health in young animals in addition to the advantage of
adult-onset CR in lifespan extension (Mattison et al. 2012).
Several recent studies on animals and humans have reported beneficial effects
of CR on different health markers, thus providing new approaches for prevention
of lifestyle diseases and healthy aging. Some well-known examples are population
of Okinawa Island (Willcox and Willcox 2014), Calorie Restriction in Biosphere 2
(Walford et al. 2002), and members enrolled in a clinical trial by Calorie Restriction Society International, who self-impose CR and believed that it will enhance
their lifespan (Fontana et al. 2004; Holloszy and Fontana 2007; Kraus et al. 2019).
CALERIE (Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of
Energy) study in humans resulted in improved insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular
health (Das et al. 2007; Redman et al. 2011). Initial reports from short-term CR
studies of 6- or 12-months part of CALERIE-I in overweight individuals showed
reduction in body weight, improved glucose regulation and cardiovascular health
(Most et al. 2017, 2018). CALERIE-II conducted in lean individuals with 25% CR
at 12 and 24 months showed lower resting metabolism, energy expenditure and
sustained metabolic fitness (Ravussinet al. 2015; Kraus et al. 2019). Although both
CALERIE studies were unable to completely match many physiological effects of
CR in rodents, these results are consistent with some beneficial effects of CR earlier
reported in monkeys (Edwards et al. 1998) showing promise of CR as a practical tool
for healthy lifespan in humans. There is not adequate evidence available in literature
regarding nutritional requirements of old people and their healthy body weight.
###### **24.3 Cellular and Molecular Basis of Potential Beneficial** **Effects of CR**

Over the years extensive research in a wide variety of species has uncovered
several pathways for the beneficial effect of CR including lifespan extension. This
section deals with cellular and molecular effectors of the proposed mechanisms of
CR. The lifespan extension effect of CR has been attributed to multiple neural,
systemic, tissue-specific, and cell autonomous mechanisms (Fontana and Partridge
2015; Fontana 2017). At cellular level, the lifespan extension effect of CR involves
increased stress resistance (Hine et al. 2015a; b), autophagy (Singh and Cuervo
2012) and chromatin remodeling (Dang et al. 2014). CR targets molecular effectors involved in energy sensing and utilization to improve cellular energetics and
metabolic homeostasis. CR also promotes anti-inflammatory intestinal microbiota,
and reduces obesity and metabolic dysfunctions (Tilg and Kaser 2011).
Molecular effectors of CR-related lifespan extension include a variety of kinases,
deacetylase enzymes, transcription factors and co-activators involved in cellular


-----

energetics pathways. FOXO, a member of forkhead family of transcription factors,
in mammals and its invertebrate homologue DAF-16, both have been implicated
in increased lifespan (Seo et al. 2015). FOXO has a very interesting role in both
stress resistance and apoptosis under variety of environmental conditions and its
activity therefore may influence target gene expression relevant for energy homeostasis, glucose metabolism, ROS, oxidative stress, stress resistance, autophagy and
cell cycle (Webb and Brunet 2014; Wang et al. 2014). AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK) is involved in the adaptive response to cellular energy deficit or changes
in cellular energetic demand. Reduction in AMPK activation has been reported with
aging, whereas, activation of AMPK pathways in multiple tissues is reported with
CR (Reznick et al. 2007; Canto and Auwerx 2011). The lifespan extension effect of
CR is at least in part dependent on mTOR signaling to regulate metabolism, insulin
sensitivity, autophagy, immunity and stress response (Kapahi et al. 2010; Kennedy
and Lamming 2016). Metabolic sensors like SIRT1 and AMPK directly regulate
PGC1a (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha, a
family of nuclear receptor transcription factors) activity through deacetylation and
phosphorylation, respectively, and improve metabolic fitness. The mechanistic Target
of Rapamycin (mTOR) is a protein kinase implicated in nutrient and energy sensing
pathways and mTOR is negatively regulated by AMPK. Overexpression of sirtuins
including SIRT1 involved in histone deacetylation improves cellular energetics and
metabolic homeostasis in addition to reducing NF-kB signaling (Guarente 2013).
All of these studies suggest that regulation of nutrient and fuel sensitive pathways
by CR is a shared mechanism to increase metabolic health and lifespan extension.
Future studies using genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic approaches may help
to understand the tissue-specific effects of CR in both animals and humans, and to
elucidate the complex underlying biological processes involved in the anti-aging and
life-prolonging effects of CR.
###### **24.4 IF-DR: Novel Strategies to Improve Metabolic Health** **and Longevity**

Pioneer research to explore the potential of CR-stimulated longevity was spearheaded
by Mark Mattson (Mattson 2005; Mattson and Wan 2005). However, recent advances
in this area of research have provided much deeper insights into the impact of novel
dietary restriction approaches on longevity and healthspan in animal models as well
as in humans (Harvie et al. 2011, 2013; Mattson et al. 2017; Anton et al. 2018).
Several alternative approaches to traditional CR have acclaimed prominence as novel
dietary regimens which may be more efficient to stimulate positive adaptive processes
without energy restriction and weight loss (Dorling et al. 2020). IF is the most
acclaimed of these novel approaches that requires either adjustment of timings for
nutrient intake or the frequency of eating to enforce periodic bouts of fasting i.e. 100%
energy restriction, generally recommended for ≥12 h (Anton et al. 2018; Patterson


-----

24 Fasting and Caloric Restriction for Healthy Aging … 511

and Sears 2017). IF based approaches are hypothesized to enhance physiological
functions and slow down disease progression attributed to prolonged gaps of daily
energy restriction (Anton et al. 2018). The potential benefits of IF observed in animal
studies have challenged the dogmatic viewpoint that CR is a prerequisite of longevitypromoting diets, and have encouraged scientists in the aging field to test the efficacy
of these newer dietary strategies in humans (Anton et al. 2018; Fontana and Partridge
2015). Some emerging IF strategies to improve health such as alternate day fasting
(ADF), alternate-day modified fasting (ADMF), 5:2IF, time restricted fasting/feeding
(TRF), and protein restriction (PR) in diet have been reported to improve markers of
aging in both pre-clinical and clinical set up. Therefore, this area of aging research
is gaining momentum to explore whether these novel strategies offer superiority
compared to the traditional CR to stimulate improvements in health and longevity
(Dorling et al. 2020; Hoddy et al. 2020).
###### ***24.4.1 Alternate-Day Fasting***

Alternate-day fasting (ADF) is one of the widely studied IF regimens in animals that
involves food withdrawal for 24 h on every other day with ad libitum access to water
(Varady and Hellerstein 2007). The lifespan extension efficacy of the ADF regimen
in rodents varies with species and age of onset (Goodrick et al. 1990; Arum et al.
2009). Several studies performed with rodents, including those from our lab, have
shown promising effects of alternate day IF regimen on stress response, neural and
synaptic plasticity and cognition (Duanet al. 2001, 2003; Lee et al. 2002a, b; Sharma
and Kaur 2005, 2007, 2008; Kumar et al. 2009). Interestingly, we observed that the
beneficial effects of early onset of IF in rats negatively influenced hypothalamohypophysial-gonadal axis and compromised their reproductive health (Kumar and
Kaur 2013). On the other hand, IF regimen started either in middle-age (Singh et al.
2015, 2017) or in late-age in rats have shown health promoting effects in reversal
of age-related impairments in stress, neuronal plasticity, inflammation and cognition
(Kaur et al. 2008; Sharma et al. 2010; Singh et al. 2012).
Keeping in view the human’s limitation to constantly maintain a certain level of
CR, Stekovic et al. (2019) carried out a clinical trial of ADF in 30 healthy non-obese
and 60 controls on conventional western diet, and observed striking reduction in
overall calorie intake for a period of more than 6 months. Moreover, ADF regimen
was more easily tolerated than chronicCR, and showed similar beneficial effects
on the cardiovascular health and fat mass. Further proteome and metabolome of
subjects categorized as long-term adopters of ADF showed a significant increase in
circulating levels of lipids and a decrease in amino acids like methionine on fasting
days. Low systemic levels of methionine and other amino acids have been reported in
model organisms to extend lifespan by reducing mTOR pathway activity and corresponding upregulation in cell autophagy (deCabo and Mattson 2019). Safety and
tolerability of ADF was evaluated in another study by Catenacci et al. (2016), which


-----

512 S. Sharma and G. Kaur

reported that alterations in body weight and composition, lipids, and insulin sensitivity index were comparable with moderate daily CR regimen. Similarly, another
recent study observed comparable effects of ADF to CR on health parameters over
eight weeks in women with obesity and reported that higher energy intake on feeding
days could offset hunger pangs on calorie restriction days and assisted in compliance
to ADF regimen (Hutchison et al. 2019). Apart from potential negative consequence
on reproductive health related to early initiated CR, practical implications in terms of
continuously practicing ADF in daily life is another limitation for human population.
###### ***24.4.2 Alternate-Day Modified Fasting***

Keeping in view the difficulties of compliance due to 100% CR during ADF regimen
on the fasting day, its modified approach (ADMF) has examined IF strategies that
permits ≤25% consumption of habitual daily calories intake during fasting days and
ad libitum feeding on alternate days (Johnson et al. 2007). Subsequent study by
Wegman et al. (2015) reported that ADMF was well tolerated and decreased plasma
insulin of healthy and lean subjects. Similar studies in obese but healthy individuals
reported that 2–3 months of ADMF lowered their adiposity and improved CVDs as
well as inflammatory markers (Bhutani et al. 2013; Varady et al. 2013; Hoddy et al.
2014), irrespective of macronutrientcomposition (Klempel et al. 2013) and meal
timings (Hoddy et al. 2014) on fasting days. Moreover, the health benefits of ADMF,
and traditional CR in terms of weight loss, weight maintenance, or cardioprotection
were found comparable over 12 months in 100 obese participants in the age group
of 18–65 years (Trepanowski et al. 2017, 2018; Gabel et al. 2019). Although no
foolproof evidence is available till date to demonstrate that ADMF offers significant
advantage to markers of aging as compared to traditional CR, but relatively easy
compliance to ADMF regimen as compared to traditional CR certainly suggests its
superiority for implementation of ADMF as an effective lifestyle intervention in the
current obesogenic environment. ***24.4.3 Intermittent Fasting Regimen 5:2***

Another novel dietary approach which has been tested recently (Anton et al. 2018) is
categorized as 5:2IF, which allows ad libitum normal diet eating for 5 days in a week
and severe/complete energy restriction on 2 days per week. Fasting is recommended
on either consecutive or non-consecutive days. The advantage of 5:2IF regimen is
its flexibility of fasting bouts which makes it easy to adopt by individuals having
inconsistent work schedules and social commitments. In a pilot study, Harvie et al.
(2011) selected 107 premenopausal overweight or obese women for either six months
of traditional CR or 5:2IF and restricted the overall energy intake of subjects by 25%
from baseline energy requirements. The main benefit of 5:2IF over CR was greater

improvements in insulin resistance and fasting insulin levels, whereas no difference
was observed in markers of energy metabolism, inflammation, and quality of life
between these two regimens. The data from such studies may help to assess the
importance of fasting independent of energy balance between different regimens.
Similar findings have been reported by some other recent studies assessing 5:2IF in
relation to traditional CR with no between-group changes in glycemic control, weight
loss, quality of life and attrition (Carter et al. 2016; Conley et al. 2018; Headland et al.
2018). Taken together, the current evidence does not clearly explain the superiority of
5:2IF over traditional CR in improving markers of aging and longevity and demands
future long-term studies in different population groups.
###### ***24.4.4 Time Restricted Feeding/Fasting as an Emerging IF*** ***Strategy***

Eating behaviors are mostly evaluated based on nutritional quality and quantity of
food, but little attention is paid to the temporal patterns of eating and their role in the
etiology of diseases. Food overeating behaviors as well as excessive consumption
of processed foods with high salt, sugars and fats are the major factors in the development of chronic lifestyle-associated pathologies (Zollner 1990; Zarrinpar et al.
2016; Mozaffarian 2016; Micha et al. 2017). Period between start of first meal to
the end of the last meal of a day is considered as the daily feeding time window.
Recently, Kant (2018) collected the data of daily feeding time from an American
cohort of 15,000 adults and reported that for most of the individuals the estimated
feeding time was 12 h, which even reached 15 h for more than half of them. Similarly, another study from India found that erratic eating pattern and prolonging daily
feeding time may be a risk factor in the development of metabolic disorders (Gupta
etal. 2017).Theserecentstudiessuggestthattheonsetofnon-communicablediseases
may be prevented/slowed down by time-restricted feeding (TRF), a regimen of IF in
which everyday’s nutrient intake is restricted to few hours (usually to 12 h during the
day), without any consideration given to alter nutrient quality or calories intake. TRF
regimensuggeststhatthedailyfoodconsumptionbelimitedwithinaperiodof4–12h,
which introduces a fasting window of 12–20 h per day (Chaix et al. 2014). The major
difference between IF and TRF regimens is that although caloric restriction is not
required during feeding time in TRF, but a daily eating window must be consistently
maintained (Moon et al. 2020). Studies on experimental animals have reported that
TRF dietary regimen attenuates the onset/progression of metabolic diseases against
pre-existing obesity, T2D, hyperinsulinemia, hepatic steatosis, inflammation (Hatori
et al. 2012; Rothschild et al. 2014).
The concept of TRF was developed keeping in view its relevance to circadian
rhythms, which are daily 24 h rhythms of body in physiology, metabolism and
behavior sustained under constant light or dark conditions (Xie et al. 2019). Several
recent pilot studies on humans have reported potential beneficial effects of TRF

regimen on metabolic health parameters (Jamshed et al. 2019; Sutton et al. 2018;
Tinsley et al. 2017). Jamshed et al (2019) studied the effects of early TRF (skipping dinner) on eleven overweight adults and observed that only 4 days of early
TRF altered the expression of 6 circadian clock genes as well as upregulated the
expression of both SIRT1 and LC3A which play important role in autophagy.
Autophagy is well reported to play a key role in protecting the body against
multiple chronic diseases like diabetes, CVDs, cancers, and neurodegenerative
diseases, by recycling used and damaged proteins and organelles. Sutton et al. (2018)
reported that 8 h of early time restricted feeding without reducing the food intake for
5 weeks although did not cause weight loss but enhanced insulin sensitivity in prediabetic men. Similarly, a recent study carried out on subjects undergoing orthodox
religious fasting reported that time restricted eating may be beneficial to provide
better metabolic and glycemic profile (Karras et al. 2021). Due to variations in protocols used and nature of study samples, TRF studies have so far produced mixed data
on the superiority of this regimen compared to other IF paradigms. However, Sutton
et al. (2018) hypothesized that TRF implemented during earlier periods of the waking
phase may elicit more noticeable benefits due to added advantage of utilizing circadian rhythms. Specifically, they postulated that the food consumed during the early
waking hours may give greater insulin sensitivity and thermic effect thus providing
a more suitable time window for food consumption to enhance metabolic endpoints.
Their study on pre-diabetic men reported that early hours TRF regimen improved
secondary outcome measures such as insulin sensitivity, hypertension, and oxidative
stress in these subjects but without any weight loss (Sutton et al. 2018).
###### **24.5 Cellular and Molecular Basis of Potential Beneficial** **Effects of IF-DR and Its Modified Versions**

Fasting involving meal skipping on designated days of the week or certain times
during a calendar year is a feature of traditional rituals among many religious groups
including Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Jews, Buddhists and others. In economically
rich societies, there is ample supply and access to food for most of the people; but
during evolution both humans and animals had intermittent access to the food, and
this is still true for wild animals which face extended bouts of fasting in nature. Organisms tend to adapt their physiology and adjust cellular energetics to achieve metabolic
homeostasis while facing this fundamental challenge of uncertain and extended
fasting bouts to enhance their survival under such adverse conditions. Quiescence
is an example of one such adaptive survival mechanisms evolved in response to
ecological constraints like prolonged fasting. It is not surprising that quiescencerelated genes are also important in the control of lifespan (Baugh 2013). Food deprivation has been shown to extend lifespan in a variety of organisms including *E. coli*
(Gonidakis et al. 2010), yeast (Longo et al. 2012), nematodes (Kaeberlein et al. 2006;
Lee et al. 2006) and flies (Partridge et al. 2005). Mammals respond to acute fasting

24 Fasting and Caloric Restriction for Healthy Aging … 515

bouts lasting 12–14 h by lowering blood glucose by more than 20% and increasing
levels of fat-derived ketone bodies, free fatty acids and gluconeogenesis. Interestingly a similar metabolic adaptation resulting in acetic acid accumulation in response
to food deprivation was reported in both bacteria and yeast (Gonidakis et al. 2010;
Longo et al. 2012). These metabolic adaptations involving switching to alternate
fuel may have originated first in microorganism and later evolved and appeared in
mammals which can respond to glucose deprivation by switching to fatty acids and
ketone bodies as an alternate fuel (Cahill 2006).
Fasting increases metabolic efficiency at the mitochondrial level, increases levels
of chaperones, inducesautophagy and genomic stability (Mattson et al. 2014). Several
studies have reported that in alternate day feeding regimen, IF-DR improves sensory,
motor, and cognitive functions including learning and memory in rodents (Singh
et al. 2012; Fontan-Lozano et al. 2007) attributed to increased neurogenesis from
neural stem cells and synaptic plasticity (Lee et al. 2002a; b). These results can
be explained with evolutionary perspective where hunger can engage sensory and
cognitive functions accompanied with neuroendocrine changes leading to increased
motivation that enables foraging and food seeking behaviors. Additionally, where
hungry animals are hypervigilant and active during foraging and on the contrary food
consumption and satiety supports a relatively sedentary state. Fasting and aerobic
exercise share many similarities in the physiological responses involved in glucose
metabolism, cardiovascular and autonomic regulation (Anson et al. 2003). Brain
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling has been shown to be sensitive to
physical activity and exercise. Several studies have shown increased BDNF signaling
in response to IF-DR in rodents (Duan et al. 2001, 2003). Thus, BDNF signaling
seems to be a shared mechanism explaining common responses to both fasting and
activity involving appetite, metabolism, cardiovascular and autonomic regulation
(Rothman et al. 2012).
From evolutionary perspective, individuals whose bodily functions were maintained under the fasted state were more successful in acquiring food as well as had
better fertility rates (Mattson et al. 2018). IF in combination with physical activity
results in depletion of liver glycogen stores on one hand and simultaneously enhances
ketone bodies production from adipose-cell-derived fatty acids. Mild stressful conditions such as IF and exercise that initially have a physiological burden but bring
about potentially beneficial effects are collectively called ‘hormetins’ (Rattan 2008).
Pioneer work by Mattson’s team reports that intermittent metabolic switching, i.e.
repeating cycles of fasting and feeding on daily basis may optimize brain functions and provide resilience throughout the lifespan and further explain that the
phenomenon of hormesis represents a key concept for such beneficial effects of IF
(Mattson 2008). Santoro et al. (2020) propose that aging may be the integrated result
of the adaptive responses such as flexibility of energy metabolism, inflammaging
and stress response, and consider IF has hormetic effects to promote healthy aging.

###### **24.6 Cross Talk Between Circadian Rhythms,** **and Time-Restricted Feeding for Healthy Aging**

The role of orexigenic and anorexigenic factors controlling short term homeostatic
feeding is well studied. Daily feeding patterns are controlled by circadian clocks,
including the resetting of master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei by ambient
light and other brain clocks by feeding time, via hormonal, nutrient and visceral
cues (Challet 2019).The plasticity of the circadian system to accommodate change
in ambient light or food availability although is an advantage in nature to adapt to
different seasons, but such plasticity may also become a liability in modern societal
setup where light and food are both available *ad libitum* round the clock. As a result,
almost all human beings in modern society are voluntarily overriding this natural
cycle of diurnal circadian rhythm by self-selecting sleep–wake timings as per their
convenienceandsuitabilitytoworkschedule.Night-shiftworkershavebeenobserved
to experience such chronodisruption with hormonal imbalance, metabolic disorders,
and increased incidence of cancer (Davis and Mirick 2006). Furthermore, there is
bidirectional link between feeding and sleep patterns. In the modern human lifestyle,
extended wakefulness allows food ingestion behavior to continue late into the night,
which significantly contributes to increased caloric intake that often correlates with
modern human lifestyle. Moreover, eating at a sub-optimal time of the 24 h circadian
rhythm promotes excessive energy storage instead of energy expenditure and often
results in overweight/obesity. Chronic disruptions of diurnal rhythms of feeding,
fasting and sleep-wake cycles i.e. chrono-disruption, can lead to circadian desynchronization with deleterious health consequences (Manoogian and Panda 2017).
TransgenicknockoutmousemodelsofcircadianrhythmgeneslikeCLOCK,BMAL1
and PER 1,2 have also been shown to result in premature aging, increased age-related
health impairments and reduced lifespan (Dubrovsky et al. 2010; Kondratov et al.
2006; Lee 2005). Mice subjected to long-term daytime restricted feeding showed
increased amplitude of CLOCK gene expression, increased expression of catabolic
factors and reduced levels of disease markers (Sherman et al. 2011). Daytime TRF
does not entrain SCN, whereas, on the contrary CR is shown to entrain SCN, indicating that energy reduction can affect central oscillator (Froy 2018). Interestingly,
the timing of food presentation in IF determines its effect on circadian rhythms such
that when food is introduced in the light period, mice exhibited arrhythmicity in
clock gene expression and in contrast, night-time feeding yielded rhythms like those
generated during *ad libitum* feeding (Froy et al. 2009). Based on these findings, it
may be suggested that adherence to timed feeding schedules especially restricting
feeding to daytime may help to prevent circadian desynchronization and improve
energy homeostasis and metabolic fitness during aging.

###### **24.7 Conclusion**

CR and different regimens of IF when integrated into the standard medical care may
hold great potential for the prevention and treatment of aging-associated chronic
metabolic diseases. The regimens such as ADF, 5:2IF, TRF, and protein restriction have recently emerged as potential alternate approaches to CR, which do not
involve any major changes in quality and quantity of nutritional intake. These novel
approaches have been shown in several pilot studies to achieve strong effects on
several disease markers which constitute the underlying basis of metabolic syndrome,
cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. Although the mechanisms of action of these regimens is still poorly understood, their major impact
appears to promote coordinated beneficial effects on the process of aging as well
as aging-associated diseases, unlike conventional pharmacological therapies which
target inhibition of specific molecules/enzymes. Moreover, TRF regimen which
recommends restricting the daily feeding time window in alignment with circadian rhythms may prove to be more beneficial in prevention and/or slow down of
aging process and promote healthspan. Taking lessons from Okinawa island people,
balanced diet consumed in moderate quantities during time-restricted window may
be the mantra to achieve wholesome nutrition as it does not require much conscious
effort and is also easy to compliant for lifelong. These practices, which are already
gaining popularity as lifestyle interventions may eventually accommodate modern
healthcare in various settings. Further future interventional studies on basic and translational research are warranted on a large number of human subjects to elucidate the
impact of TRF on different parameters of physical and mental health.

**Bauyrzhan Umbayev, Yuliya Safarova, Aislu Yermekova, and Timur Saliev**

**Abstract** The regulation of nutrition and metabolism plays a pivotal role in regulating the aging process. The nutrition is a critical external factor influencing the
development of aging and associated disorders. One of the well-known dietary interventions to slow aging and reduce mortality is calorie restriction. The results of
the range of studies indicate that calorie restriction facilitates the increase in life
expectancy and a decrease in the aging processes. The effect of calorie restriction on
the aging process has been associated with a wide range of the reactions in different
types of cells, particularly the stem cells. This Chapter discusses the role of the stem
cells in aging processes and associated disorders in the context of calorie restriction strategies. It encompasses the analysis of the results of preclinical and clinical
studies on the relationship between the calorie restriction and adult stem cell function
in order to understand the effects of calorie restriction on the health and longevity.
The Chapter highlights the role of stem cells in neurogenesis, alterations in stem cell
function under the influence of calorie restriction. In addition, the potential of the
calorie restriction mimetics as aging modulators has been discussed too.

identified (Kennedy et al. 2014). These mechanisms encompass macromolecular
damage, metabolism, stem cells and regeneration, proteostasis, adaptation to stress,
inflammation and epigenetics (Kennedy et al. 2014). In the context of the current
understanding of aging, it has been assumed that human body has developed adaptive
strategies to recognize and neutralize the combination of the stress factors that affect
the biological mechanisms described above and adaptive consequences of protective
responses formed during the evolution process (Epel and Lithgow 2014; Santoro et al.
2020). In case the human body fails to adapt to the stressor, it leads to the disruption
of the homeostasis and eventually may cause the development of age-related changes
(Santoro et al. 2020).
One of the most important environmental factors associated with the vital activity
of the body is the availability of nutrients (Speakman 2013). The lack of the nutrients
is a possibly predictable event and in the course of evolution adaptive mechanisms for
starvation have been formed, but excess of nutrients (especially some in particular)
andassociatedobesityisnon-adaptive,andfacilitatesmetabolicdysfunction(Santoro
et al. 2020).
The importance of the regulation of nutrition and metabolism is demonstrated in
recent advances in proteomics and metabolomics indicate that metabolic signalling
pathways play a pivotal role in regulating the aging process and nutrition can be a
critical external factor influencing the development of aging (Schüler et al. 2020).
Moreover, according to the hypothesis “metabolic age score” metabolic changes
accumulate over time, and an estimate of metabolic age score is an informative
measurement of the biological age (López-Otín et al. 2016; Hertel et al. 2016). In
compliance with the numerous studies congenital defects in the metabolic signalling
pathways accelerate aging, and the maintenance of longevity is closely related to the
metabolic processes (López-Otín et al. 2016; Barzilai et al. 2012, Catic 2018).
The regulation of aging by the metabolic processes can be considered within
the concept of hormesis, where a certain level of the metabolic disorders weakens
the effects of aging due to the activation and upregulation of the protective cellular
pathways. However, over-activation of the metabolism leads to an acceleration of the
aging processes (Gems and Partridge 2008; Santoro et al. 2020). This concept agrees
with the numerous data that indicate that calorie restriction (CR) from a normal diet,
and not just a lack of overeating, facilitates the increase in life expectancy and a
decrease in the aging processes of animals and humans (Heilbronn and Ravussin
2003; Flanagan et al. 2020; Franceschi et al. 2018). Along with the organismal level,
CR promotes changes in the aging phenotypes at the tissue, cellular and molecular
levels. (Ma et al. 2020).
The selection of the optimal CR program is a very urgent task in gerontology.
Considering CR in the prism of hormesis, the use of the moderate (usually intermittent) stress is necessary to obtain a beneficial effect as it was noted in the pioneering
works of Mattson (Mattson 2008). In addition, it was assumed that adaptive responses
arising under the influence of the food stress in the aging organisms lose the intensity of the response and so-called “metabolic flexibility”, i.e. the ability to balance
between the energy consumption and energy storage (Storlien et al. 2004). Perhaps
this is one of the reasons for the change in the body’s sensitivity to CR with age. In

addition, other negative aspects of CR should be noted: acceleration of the sarcopenia
in old organisms, possible malnutrition, difficulty in maintaining the diet in the
elderly, etc. (Xie et al. 2020; Locher et al. 2016, Madeo et al. 2019). In this regard,
a possible alternative is a chemical compound capable of imitating CR – calorie
restriction mimetics (Shintani et al. 2018, Madeo et al. 2019).
The difficulty in assessing the effect of CR on the aging process is associated
with a wide range of the reactions in different types of cells, tissues and organs
caused by aging and the subsequent various adaptive and non-adaptive consequences
of the calorie restriction (Ma et al. 2020). To improve the understanding of this
processes we should focus on the impact of CR on the adult stem cells, which
are the key in maintaining tissue homeostasis. Adult stem cells (ASC) (specific
tissue stem cells, somatic stem cells) have been found in many human and animal
tissues. ASCs are undifferentiated cells (relative to the functional tissue) capable
of proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation into tissue-specific precursors to
maintain the tissue homeostasis and tissue regeneration upon the illness or injury
(Loeffler and Roeder 2002). The most studied adult stem cells are hematopoietic
stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells (Clevers 2015, Gonzalez and Bernad 2012).
Like normal somatic cells, somatic stem cells are exposed to various stress factors
throughout the life, which leads to aging, (Jones and Rando 2011, Sharpless and
DePinho 2007, Alt et al. 2012, Liu and Rando 2011, Rando 2006) and this can be
one of the reasons of the overall organism aging (Fukada et al. 2014; Mimeault and
Batra 2009). Taking into the account the key role of the stem cells in maintaining
a dynamic balance in tissue and organ homeostasis, it is easy to assume that they
play a central role in aging and the pathophysiology of the various age-associated
diseases such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, malignant tumors,
diabetes, autoimmune diseases, recurrent infections, impaired wound healing and
other diseases (Schultz and Sinclair 2016, Goodell and Rando 2015, Smith and
Daniel 2012, Sharpless and DePinho 2007, Boyette and Tuan 2014).
One of the main mechanisms in aging of the adult stem cells is a disruption of
proteostasis and autophagy (Chang 2020). At the same time, CR contributes to the
restoration of these processes inside the cell (Chang 2020, Chung and Chung 2019)
and therefore the CR mimetics should have a similar effect on the aging of the adult
stem cells.

In recent years, much attention has been paid to the development of anti-aging
strategies aimed at preventing and/or slowing down the aging process based on the use
of the body’s internal abilities for self-healing (Santoro et al. 2020), it is important to
consider the potential of the CR mimetics in maintaining normal tissue homeostasis
through the activation of the adult stem cells.
###### **25.2 Calorie Restriction and Adult Stem Cells**

The best known dietary intervention to slow aging and reduce mortality is calorie
restriction (CR). Food intake is reduced below the energy requirements without

malnutrition or deprivation of the essential nutrients. (Heilbronn and Ravussin
2003; Flanagan et al. 2020). In various preclinical models CR strikingly increase
life expectancy (Heilbronn and Ravussin 2003; Flanagan et al. 2020). Data from
controlled clinical trials in humans associates CR with prolonged life spanonaver
age by 1–5 years (Flanagan et al. 2020). The specific mechanisms underlying CR are
not clear, but existing evidence suggests that CR stimulates cellular defense mechanisms such as autophagy, mitochondrial efficacy, decreases ROS production, and
decreases inflammatory cytokines (Flanagan et al. 2020). According to the preclinical
studies CR is strongly dependent on the genotype and sex, and the growth hormone
(GH)/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) axis (Komatsu et al. 2019). Given the
importance of adult stem cells in aging, many researchers have studied the relationship between the calorie restriction and adult stem cell function to understand the
effects of CR on the health and longevity. In a number of studies caloric restriction
modulates the functionality of adult stem cells and may have positive effects on the
biology of stem cells in various tissues (Mazzoccoli et al. 2014, Maharajan et al.
2020).
The most sensitive cells to caloric restriction are hematopoietic stem cells
(Wilkinson and Yamazaki 2018). For example, restricting diet to 75% food intake
for about 2 years in BALB/cByJ mice (BALB)inhibits haematopoiesis and prevents
HSC senescence. Interestingly, HSC function in 25 month old CR mice was better
than in 3 month old mice without CR (Chen et al. 2003). In addition, compared to the
long-term exposure, 5 months calorie restriction meals improved function of HSC
to a lesser extent. (Chen et al. 2003). In turn, Tangetal found that a long-term diet of
70% of food intake (30% CR) for 6 and 12 months positively affects the phenotypes
of aging HSC (increased number of HSCs and bias towards myeloid HSC during
aging.) and the resting state of HSC in C57BL/6 J mice, but at the same time negatively affects B-lymphopoiesis in mice, disrupting the differentiation of HSC down
the lymphoid lineage. The negative effect of 30% CR on B-lymphopoaesis was mediated by a decrease in the level of IL-6, IL-7, while the effect of CR on the resting
state of cell was associated with a decrease in the concentration of IGF1 (Tang et al.
2016).
On the other hand, a lifelong caloric restriction facilitated stabilization of the
bone marrow cellularity, but the number of HSCs increased compared to the animals
with aging without calorie restriction. Also, the lifelong calorie restriction did not
improve the reduced HSC functionality (Lazare et al. 2017). The authors suggest
that the inconsistency of the results is associated with different experimental design
(different duration of the diet - fasting kinetics), and also point to the importance of
the composition of the standard diet, especially the content of valine (Lazare et al.
2017).
Intestinal stem cells are another attractive object of the research to assess the
effect of CR on the adult stem cells (Bruens et al. 2020; Igarashi and Guarente
2016; Yilmaz et al. 2012). Early studies showed that a 60–70% CR-diet increased
the number of stem cells in the intestinal crypts (Igarashi and Guarente 2016; Yilmaz
et al. 2012) and reduced the incidence of the intestinal polyps by almost 60% (Mai
et al. 2003). In addition, Yilmaz et al. revealed that Paneth cells in the intestinal


-----

25 Calorie Restriction Mimetics and Adult Stem Cells 529

stem cell nichemediate the effects of CRonISC. An important finding in the study
of the effect of CR on ISC was made recently, where at 40% CR for 8 weeks in
mice, the length and width of the small intestine did not change, but there was a
reversible increase in crypt diameter, which was associated with an increase in the
number of Lgr5 + stem cells and lysozyme + Paneth cells (niche expansion) (Bruens
et al. 2020). Another significant results revealed that the increase in the number of
stem cells associated with the CR diet leads to the displacement of the stem cells
carrying pathological mutations (oncogenic APC mutations) from the niche as a
result of competition of the stem cells on the basis of fitness and also leads to a lower
retention of mutations in the intestine (Bruens et al. 2020).
In addition, CR affects not only Lgr5 + stem cells, but also reserve ISCs. CR
expands the pool of the reserve ISCs and increases the regenerative capacity of the
intestinal epithelium (Yousefi et al. 2018).
The mechanism of the intestinal stem cells regulation is based on the kinaseregulated signalling pathway, mammalian target of the rapamycin complex 1
(mTORC1) (Igarashi and Guarente, 2016; Yilmaz et al. 2012; Yousefi et al. 2018).
This signalling pathway shows the opposite responses in the ISC compared to the
niche cells (Maharajan et al. 2020). Thus, CR favours a decrease in mTOR signalling
in Paneth cells and induce the bone stromal antigen 1 (Bst-1), which converts NAD1
into secreted cyclic ribose ADP (cADPR) and activates calcium signalling and
this, in turn, stimulates the proliferation of neighbouring stem cells (Yilmaz et al.
2012). Suppression of mTORC1 by exposure to CR was also noted in reserve ISCs
(Yousefi et al. 2018). In contrast, a diet associated with caloric restriction activates
the mTORC1-p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K1) axis and increases the number of
Lgr5 + stem cells through the NAD-dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1(Igarashi
and Guarente, 2016).
Interesting data was obtained in a recent study, when in a short-term (9 days)
60% CR diet the number of the stem cells increased, but the proliferation and size of
the organelles obtained from the crypts diminished. At the same time, a similar diet
in the germ-free (GF) mice did not cause changes in the size of organelles, which
designate the role of the microbiome in the effect of CR on the intestinal stem cells
(Glenny et al. 2020).
Adipose tissue is very sensitive to a calorie restriction, mitigating age-related
adipocyte size increase and stimulating the production of the functional beige fat
in the subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, and prevent aging of the white
adipose tissue (Sheng et al. 2020, Fabbiano et al. 2016). However, the effect of CR
on the adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells is poorly understood. Keeping
C57BL/6 mice at the age of 4 months or 21–29 months on a 60% CR diet for
9 months ensued a decrease in the age-related increase in the number of ASCs, but
it also reduced cell clonality during aging and CR (Schmuck et al. 2011).
Thermoregulation studies in CR animals showed the importance of the ambient
temperatureandcoatandskinforregulatingtheenergybalance(Ravussinetal. 2012).

stem cells. The authors of this work suggest that the thermoregulatory adaptive
evolutionary mechanism compensates for the heat loss (Forni et al. 2017).
One of the most dangerous conditions associated with aging is dementia and other
cognitive impairments that dramatically reduce the productivity and quality of life
in elderly (Desai et al. 2010). Therefore, the regulation of the brain aging processes
with diet, and in particular calorie restriction, draws in much consideration of the
researchers. (Dias et al. 2020). Mild to moderate CR (≤ 40%) CR launched at an
early stage improved neurovascular functions of the brain, cognitive function and
memory in aging animals compared to the controls (Parikh et al. 2016; Kaptan et al.
2015). Considering the role of stem cells in neurogenesis, alterations in stem cell
function under the influence of CR have called the increased attention in studying
the effects of CR on cognitive function and brain neuroplasticity. (Apple et al. 2019;
Dias et al. 2020). Several preclinical studies show that CR stimulates cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus and subventricular zone (SVZ), where
neurogenesis occur throughout life and slows down with aging (Park et al. 2013;
Kaptan et al. 2015; Apple et al. 2019). On the other hand, long-term CR at the age
of 3 to 11 months had no effect on neurogenesis in the granular cell layer (GCL),
but stimulated the survival of the newly formed glial cells in the hilus of the dentate
gyrus (Bondolfi et al. 2004).
A recent study by Apple et al. (2019) found out that calorie restriction has a
differential effect on the proliferation and production of neurons by the neuronal
stem cells in the SVZ, depending on the age at which the diet was initiated (Apple
et al. 2019). If 60% of CR was launched at an early age (6 to 7 months) within
16 weeks, it supported the increase of proliferation of stem and progenitor cells in the
SVZ. Moreover, if the CR diet was started at an old age (from 12 to 18 months), these
animals did not have an increase in proliferation, but the neurogenesis was equivalent
to that in the young mice. The authors suggest that perhaps caloric restriction may
improve neonatal survival of neurons. In addition, in this study, CR was shown to
contribute to the ability of the neural stem cells in aged mice to differentiate into
neurons *in vivo* . A possible effect of CR on the preservation of the neural stem cell
function in the old brain has been associated with the amelioration of the progressive
inflammation (decreased number of the activated microglia and cytokine expression)
(Apple et al. 2019).
One of the mechanisms involved in increasing the adaptiveness and resistance of
the neurons in CR may be the induction of the neurotrophic factors, such as brain
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Fontán-Lozano et al. 2008; Kishi et al. 2014). It should
be noted that there is conflicting evidence regarding BDNF expression in CR, if shortterm exposure to 15% CR for 4 weeks in young females resulted in increased levels
of BDNF in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) in adulthood (Kaptan et al.
2015), than long-term exposure to 30% CR in male mice starting at 3 months of age
for 9 months or over 17 months reduced BDNF levels compared to the animals fed
ad libitum (Yang et al. 2014). Most studies suggest that one of the key mechanisms
of regulation induced by CR might be the inhibition of the decrease in age-related
autophagy, in particular through the mTOR signalling pathway (Maiese et al. 2013;
Raman et al. 2013). Several studies revealed that aging-related neurodegeneration is

accompanied by the increased activation of mTOR signalling (Maiese et al. 2013;
Troca-Marín et al. 2011). On the other hand according to Yang et al. there is a parallel
decrease in mTOR signalling and activity with age in the hippocampus of mice
(Yang et al. 2014). Therefore, it is assumed that the mTOR signalling cascade play
different roles in the hippocampus of young and old mice (Yang et al. 2014). However,
the main mechanisms mediating the relationship between CR and neurogenesis are
poorly understood. Interesting data were obtained in a recent study where short-term
CR (overnight) activates new neurons of the olfactory bulb born in adult mice in a
ghrelin-dependent manner (Ratcliff et al. 2019).
One of the main reasons of frailty in older people and their loss of independence
is age-related degenerative muscle loss, deterioration of the muscle fibres, and a
decrease in the strength of muscle contraction, which is called sarcopenia (Xie et al.
2020). Several animal studies have been known to show that CR leads to a reduction or delay in the age-related defects that occur in the skeletal muscle (Xie et al.
2020; Boldrin et al. 2017). Muscle stem cells are also sensitive to the effects of CR.
Thus, an early study conducted in young C57BL/6 mice (2 months), and on old mice
(18 months), which were exposed to CR (1 week at 20% restriction and 11 weeks
at 40%) showed that CR promoted an increase in frequency of skeletal muscle stem
cells in young and old mice. These cells had an increased number of the mitochondria and muscle after CR showed increased regeneration rate (Cerletti et al. 2012).
Later studies also showed that 25 weeks exposure to 30% CR increased the skeletal
muscle stem cells in aged mice (60 weeks old) (Sato et al. 2017). Also in this study,
mice on CR diet showed the reorganization of the transcriptome in muscle stem cells,
manifested in the regular transcription of genes associated with the self-renewal and
decreased activity of the genes involved in inflammation or repair of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). This might be an indirect evidence of the restoration of the
stem cells and the slowing down of their aging.
More recently, a 40% CR short-term (3 months) or long-term (6 months) diet in 12week-old adult male Sprague–Dawley rats sustained the clonal myogenic activity in
muscle stem cells (Abreu et al. 2020). At the same time, interestingly, calorie restriction did not affect mitochondrial (oxygen consumption rates, including basal and
physiological respiration, ATP-associated and dependent on proton leakage respiration, maximum and reserve respiration) or glycolytic function. (Abreu et al. 2020).
Overall, these results showed that caloric restriction did not result in overt changes
in the muscle stem cell metabolism.

In addition, the effects of CR on the muscle stem cells depend on many factors,
such as lineage, sex and age of animals according to the findings of Boldrin et al.
in 2017. (Boldrin et al. 2017). Researchers showed that short-term (3 months) and
longer (9 and 19 months) CR have different effects on the skeletal muscle in male
and female C57Bl/6 and DBA/2 mice (shorter-lived strain) *[36]* *.* The exposure to CR
was shown to increase the number of the satellite cells by 6 months, but their number
decreases by 12 months. In addition, CR increased fibrosis by increasing the collagen
VI content in mouse muscle and decreased muscle regenerative response. Also CR
makes satellite cells less proliferative *in vitro* (Boldrin et al. 2017).

Reducing oxidative stress, increasing mitochondrial function, suppressing inflammation and apoptosis, and activating autophagy are thought to play an important role
in CR-mediated regulation of the sarcopenia, but the exact mechanism by which CR
affects stem cells in the skeletal muscle is still a matter of debate.

It should be noted that restricting calories can have both positive and negative
consequences. (Xie et al. 2020). Age has been shown to play an important role
in the response to calorie restriction. For example, it was shown that short-term CR
(4weeks) ledtotheacceleratedmuscledegradationinmiceinoldSDrats (25months)
(Park et al. 2017). In this aspect, it is the effect of calorie restriction on sarcopenia in
the elderly that is one of the main obstacles in calorie restriction therapy (Xie et al.
2020). Thus, based on the above results of the various studies, it could be concluded
that calorie restriction has an impact on the functioning of the adult stem cells. At the
same time, the degree of the impact depends on the duration of the calorie restriction
diet, and in the safest and most effective diet option is a short-term diet. In addition,
the age at which the diet is launched is an important parameter. Thus, the best effects
were achieved with a diet started at a young age, whereas a diet in old age may not
have positive results or even lead to the negative consequences. It should also be
noted that the heterogeneity of the adult stem cells is responsible for the variability
of the signalling pathways underlying the mechanisms of CR effect.
In addition, there is evidence that often the calorie restricted diet used in various
models is not complete and often leads to malnutrition in both mice and rats
(Cerqueira and Kowaltowski 2010). Another limitation is the loss of the muscle
mass and a decrease in the body mass index in CR in the elderly, which carries
potential risks associated with an increased risk of disability and mortality. (Xie
et al. 2020). Taken together, these potential risks of CR are of concern that must
be considered before it could be widely used. The establishment of standardized
preclinical complete diet models is needed to study the mechanisms of CR in more
detail.

Considering the risks of CR for the elderly, it is necessary to develop alternative
approaches, one of which may be the use of strategies based on simulating the effects
of CR, for example, the use of calorie restriction mimetics (Ingram et al. 2006).
###### **25.3 Calorie Restriction Mimetics as Aging Modulators**

However, despite the accumulated data on the effect of calorie restriction on slowing
aging,thebodyresponsesinolderadultsdifferfromthoseinyoungerpeople.Thusthe
health benefits of calorie restriction in elderly remain uncertain (Locher et al. 2016).
Changing the eating behaviour of older adults and, moreover, maintaining long-term
calorie restriction is challenging (Madeo et al. 2019). Therefore, the idea to develop
techniques or compounds that can reproduce the effect of calorie restriction without
restricting the food intake seems very attractive (appealing). In 1998, Lane et al.
found that feeding rats with 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG) for 24 weeks could mimic
the metabolic effects of long-term CR intervention without significant toxicity or


-----

25 Calorie Restriction Mimetics and Adult Stem Cells 533

sustained alteration in food intake (Lane et al. 1998). Based on the obtained results,
they proposed the concept of calorie restriction mimetics (CRMs), i.e. compounds
that demonstrate the systemic effects of CR (Madeo et al. 2019).
Currently, in the broadest terms, CRMs are viewed as any intervention that demonstrates the systemic effects of CR and increases life expectancy and prevents aging.
These include anorectic or nutrient absorption inhibiting agents such as caloric
restriction mimetics, calorie-reducing drugs such as sodium glucose co-transporter
2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), and even bariatric surgery (Ingram et al. 2006).
An important debatable issue in this concept is the precise definition of the concept
of CR mimetics as pharmacological agents (Shintani et al. 2018, Madeo et al. 2019).
Over the past two decades, there has been no consensus on the biochemical and
functional determination of CR mimetics (Ingram and Roth 2015). Pioneers of the
mimetic concept, Ingram et al. suggested descriptors specific to CRM: (1) mimics the
metabolic,hormonal,andphysiologicaleffectsoftheCR;(2)activatesstressresponse
pathways observed in CR and enhances the stress protection; (3) produces CRlike effects on longevity, reduces age-related disease, and maintains more youthful
function; and (4) does not significantly reduce food intake, at least over the shortterm (Ingram and Roth, 2015; Ingram et al. 2006, 2004). Based on these descriptors,
the concept of mimetics is a broad view of the CR mimetics.
In a narrower sense, the basic properties of CR mimetics are thought to be associated with the regulation of autophagy and glucose metabolism as key mechanisms of
calorie restriction within the cell (Shintani et al. 2018, Madeo et al. 2019). According
to Madeo et al. CRms are compounds that activate autophagy by promoting the
deacetylation of the cellular proteins, by (1) depleting acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA),
(2) inhibiting acetyltransferases, and/or (3) stimulating deacetylases (Madeo et al.
2019).
The question of the ability of CRMs to increase life expectancy is unclear. It is
assumed that the overall cumulative effect of the CRM exposure is an increase in life
expectancy and a decrease in age-related disorders (Ingram et al. 2006). However,
the effectiveness of CRMs in this aspect is unclear and, for example, so far, only
rapamycin has shown a steady effect on the increase in life expectancy as in rodents
regardless of their sex (Miller et al. 2011; Harrison et al. 2009). But at the same
time, in another study, rapamycin has a limited effect on aging in mammals and
increases lifespan, possibly activating mechanisms of suppression of carcinogenesis
(Neff et al. 2013). The lack of CRMs effectiveness to increase lifespan may be due
to the fact, that the positive effects of the CR are mediated through the regulation of
many intracellular signaling pathways, whereas CRMs are apparently involved in the
activation of only some of the pathways and there is no single CR mimetic capable
of mimicking CR alone. Therefore, some studies suggest the use of a combination
of several CR mimetics (Ingram and Roth 2015). Thus, most likely CRM is a group
of molecularly unrelated compounds capable of partially causing effects similar to
CR on the cells, tissues, and organs.
However, despite the absence of the mimetics that completely mimick the effects
of the calorie restriction, the currently known CRMs are able to positively influence
the aging processes of the cardiovascular system, and also reduce acute ischemia in

preclinical models (Sciarretta et al. 2020). Slowing down the aging of the neuromuscular junctions and muscle fibers has also been observed with the exposure to CRMs
(Stockinger et al. 2018). What’s more, CRMs have beneficial effects on the brain
aging and prevent Alzheimer’s disease (Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2016; Chiba et al.
2010). In addition, numerous studies indicate a protective role for CRMs in diabetes
and obesity (Chiba et al. 2010).
###### **25.4 Calorie Restriction Mimetics and Adult Stem Cell** **Aging**

The previous section of the chapter described the relationship between CR and adult
stem cell function, and reported studies showing that CR has a generally positive
effect on the adult stem cells and inhibits aging. Accordingly, it is logical to assume
that when exposed to CRMs, one can expect their influence on the functioning of the
stem cells through the activation of the molecular pathways involved in the response
to CR. Therefore, in this section of the chapter, we summarize the impact of CRMs
on the adult stem cells in aging.
The intestinal tract is the first organ in contact with food, and at the same time is
very sensitive to calorie restriction (Peña-Villalobos et al. 2019), therefore, first of all,
it is necessary to pay attention to the reactions of the intestinal stem cells to the action
of CRMs. It has been shown that the antidiabetic drug metformin, which is classified
as CRMs (Martel et al. 2021), improve aging phenotypes (hyperproliferation, centrosome amplification, and accumulation of DNA damage) in the Drosophila intestinal
stem cells through the down-regulation of the AKT / TOR signaling pathway (Na
et al. 2015, 2018). It was recently found that alpha-lipoic acid (ALA; 1,2-dithiolane3-pentanoic acid), also referred to as CRM, also had a positive effect on the aging
phenotypes of the Drosophila intestinal stem cells, resulting in the suppression of
the age-related hyperproliferation of the intestinal stem cells (Du et al. 2020). Interestingly, the effect of ALA on stem cells was achieved not due to the antioxidant
capacity, but due to the activation of the expression of specific genes associated with
the autophagy and endocytosis in old cells (Du et al. 2020).
Nicotinamide riboside (NR), a precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD + ), is a potent anti-inflammatory agent and an aging modulator (Mehmel
et al. 2020) with CRMs properties (Madeo et al. 2019). A study by Igarashi et al.
(2019) found that oral administration of NR at a concentration of 500 mg/kg/day
in drinking water for 6 weeks resulted in ISC recovery in aged mice *in vivo*, while
ex vivo studies showed improved colony formation in aged mice and the effect of
NR was blocked by the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin or the SIRT1 inhibitor EX527
(Igarashi et al. 2019). At the same time, data on the effect of the mTORC1 inhibitor
rapamycin, one of the most studied CRMs, on the intestinal stem cells is controversial
(He et al. 2020; Igarashi and Guarente 2016; Yilmaz et al. 2012). On the one hand, a
recent study showed that mTORC1 is strongly upregulated in the ISC cells in aged

25 Calorie Restriction Mimetics and Adult Stem Cells 535

mice and mTORC1 inhibition resulted in a partial improvement in aging phenotypes
in 16 diet-restriction-induced ISC expansion of one-month-old mice (He et al. 2020).
In contrast, Igarashi et al. demonstrated that caloric restriction induces an increase
in mTORC1 activity in ISCs leading to the increased cell proliferation, whereas
rapamycin suppressed dietary restriction-induced ISC proliferation (Igarashi and
Guarente 2016).
The functioning of the hematopoietic stem cells can also be altered by CRMs,
especially by the compounds associated with the regulation of mTOR. The importance of mTOR in HSC aging is evidenced by the results of a study that showed that
age-related functional decline in HSC is improved in long-lived mTOR mutant mice
(Selman et al. 2016). And also in another study, mTOR activity increases in the HSC
of mice with aging, and rapamycin at a dose of 4 mg/kg every other day for 6 weeks
increased lifespan, restored self-renewal and hematopoiesis of HSC in old mice
(22 months) (Chen et al. 2009). An ex vivo study showed that rapamycin treatment
inhibited the cellular senescence, possibly through Bmi1 activation and p16 inhibition, and led to the stimulation of ex vivo expansion and long-term hematopoietic
repair of HSCs (Luo et al. 2014).
Resveratrol also affects hematopoiesis *in vitro* and *in vivo* (Rimmelé et al. 2014;
Zhang et al. 2010; Matsui et al. 2012). Rimmelé et al. demonstrated that daily administration of resveratrol (5 mg/kg) for three weeks increased the frequency and the
total number of the Lin - Sca1 + c-Kit + (LSK) cells in the bone marrow of the
C57BL/6 mice (Rimmelé et al. 2014). In addition, the treatment with the resveratrol
improved the state of the LSK-HSC, positively influenced the microenvironment of
the bone marrow, and partially corrected the abnormal status of the cell cycle in
a mouse model of the Fanconi anemia (Zhang et al. 2010). A similar effect on the
same Fanconi model of anemia was demonstrated by metformin, a therapy that led to
an improvement in the hematopoiesis, increased the size of the hematopoietic stem
cell compartment, and enhanced the rest of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor
cells. Moreover, metformin reduced the DNA damage and improved the spontaneous
chromosome breakage in cells (Zhang et al. 2016).
The importance of the autophagy activation when exposed to CRMs on the skeletal
mouse stem cells has been shown in a number of studies (Ramos et al. 2012). It was
shown that in prematurely senescent mice, the muscle-derived stem/progenitor cells
(MDSPCs) exhibit abnormalities in proliferation, chondrogenic, osteogenic, and
myogenicdifferentiationandregenerativepotential,andcultivationintherapamycincontaining media resulted in the improved differentiation and decreased apoptosis
and aging (Kawakami et al. 2019).
One of the key regulators of the autophagy is Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), also known as
a NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1, the nutrient sensor, so resveratrol as an
activator of the Sirt1 can influence the functioning of the satellite cells (Alway et al.
2014). Resveratrol, for example, caused the restoration of muscle mass in the plantar
muscle of old rats after hanging the hind limbs, which was associated with the
improvement of the satellite cell proliferation in the hind limb muscles (Bennett
et al. 2013). On the other hand, the 10-month consumption of the resveratrol had a
protective effect against the aging-induced oxidative stress in the skeletal muscles,

but did not attenuate sarcopenia in mice (Jackson et al. 2011). This is possible because
the effect of resveratrol may depend on its concentration. Resveratrol at low doses
(10 μM) caused the myoblast cell cycle stop, migration and promoted the muscle
regeneration *in vitro* by attenuating ROS exposure, while higher doses (40–60 μM)
suppressed these effects (Bosutti and Degens, 2015).
Metformin, as a regulator of autophagy, also caused the metabolic reprogramming
in the fate of the skeletal muscle stem cells. Interestingly, in a recent study by Pavlidou
et al. it was shown that unlike resveratrol, metformin did not lead to the activation
of Sirt1 in the satellite cells, and contributed to the maintenance of the satellite
cells at rest, caused a delay in their differentiation *in vitro* and slowed down the
process of muscle regeneration after the cardiotoxin injury *in vivo* (Pavlidou et al.
2019). On the other hand, the metformin improved *in vivo* the regeneration after
a burn injury by activating the proliferation of the Pax7-positive satellite cells via
the AMPK signalling pathway (Yousuf et al. 2020). The authors suggest that the
differences between the two studies are due to the fact, that the burn injury causes
systemic inflammation that lasts 2 weeks, as opposed to the shorter exposure to
cardiotoxin. In addition, after a burn, animals are more mobile and this affects the
muscle regeneration (Yousuf et al. 2020). Moreover, conflicting results have been
obtained with the myogenic cell differentiation. On the one hand, it was found that
in myoblasts, the metformin-treated MyoD and p21cip1 are not activated, which
negatively affects the myogenic differentiation (Pavlidou et al. 2017). In contrast,
another study showed that metformin did not affect the proliferation but enhanced
the myogenic cell differentiation (Senesi et al. 2016). These results demonstrate the
complex nature of the effects of metformin on the muscle stem cells and the need
for more detailed studies.

Several studies have shown an association between the changes in polyamine
levels in the muscle fibers and the skeletal muscle atrophy and hypertrophy (Lee and
MacLean, 2011). It was shown that *in vitro* polyamines (putrescine, spermidine and
spermine) cause activation of the satellite cells and the expression of myogenic regulatory factors (Thornton et al. 2013). *in vivo* studies have shown that intraperitoneal
injections of spermidine at a dose of 100 mg/kg of body weight every other day for
32 days induced the autophagy in the satellite cells and activated the resting satellite
cells in mice (Zhang et al. 2018).
Simulating the effect of calorie restriction on the cardiovascular system is one
of the most important properties of mimetics (Sciarretta et al. 2020). An interesting
question is how much adult heart stem cells are involved in this process, which can
play a central role in the age-related remodeling of the heart (Carresi et al. 2021).
Among the known mimetics, the most effective heart stem cell stimulant (CSC)
is the resveratrol. The main results were obtained from the studies related to the

transplantation of the CSCs for the treatment of myocardial infarction. A study
in Sprague–Dawley rats demonstrated that preliminary systemic administration of
resveratrol at a concentration of 2.5 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks improved the myocardial
tissue environment and increased the survival and proliferation and the differentiation
of transplanted CSCs in the area of the myocardial infarction (Gurusamy et al. 2010).


-----

25 Calorie Restriction Mimetics and Adult Stem Cells 537

Pre-treatment with resveratrol for 60 min with the CSC before transplantation
resulted in the improved cardiac function and enhanced engraftment of the implanted
stem cells that had increased the expression of Nrf2, Ref-1 and NFoB (Gorbunov
et al. 2012). Resveratrol at a concentration of 2.5 mg/kg per day for 4 weeks was
also shown to activate the transplanted Sca-1 + CSC cells in the heart. The authors
showed that the upregulation of the VEGF and SDF-1α is the likely mechanism
underlying the resveratrol action (Ling et al. 2017). Resveratrol has been shown
in several studies to promote the differentiation of the Human Induced Pluripotent
Stem Cells into cardiomyocytes through inhibition of the canonical Wnt signaling
pathway and the SRF-miR-1 (Liu et al. 2016). It was also shown that the resveratrol
concentration of 10 μmol/L was optimal for stimulating the differentiation of the
mouse embryonic stem cells into cardiomyocytes (Ding et al. 2016).
Rapamycin also alters the functional properties of the CSCs, which is associated
with the importance of mTOR activity for the vital activity of the heart stem cells
(Zheng et al. 2017). Several studies have shown that rapamycin effectively accelerates the differentiation of the embryonic stem cells into the cardiomyocytes (Qiu
et al. 2017; Lu et al. 2017). Investigations that demonstrate the role of rapamycin
regulation of the mTOR activity in the senescent CSCs are important. Studies of the
effect of rapamycin on the CSC showed that *in vitro* the treatment of the cells with
the rapamycin (10 nM) and resveratrol (0.5 μM) reduced the cellular senescence and
IL1β secretion and increased the rate of cell proliferation, due to the mechanisms that
were activated by the increased phosphorylation of AMPK. Moreover, this preliminary pharmacological treatment of the old CSCs *in vitro* led to an improvement in
their reparative potential *in vivo* (Avolio et al. 2014).
A recent study showed that a treatment with rapamycin (100 nM) markedly
improves the cellular functions, attenuates the replicative senescence, and promotes
the proliferation of the senescent human cardiac progenitor cells (hCPCs) (Park et al.
2020). In addition, the long-term treatment with rapamycin improves the clonogenic
potential and maintains the migration/differentiation capacity of the old hCPCs (Park
et al. 2020). It was also shown that the rapamycin pretreatment of mesenchymal stem
cells isolated from the rat bone marrow enhances the cardiogenesis and differentiation of the transplanted cells into the cardiomyocytes in a model of myocardial
infarction (Li et al. 2020). However, metformin impaired the homing and survival of
the MSCs in the heart in the diabetic streptozotocin-induced cardiomyopathy in rats
(Ammar et al. 2021).
###### **25.5 Calorie Restriction Mimetics for Neural Stem Cells** **and Neurogenesis**

The previous section of the chapter summarized the results of the studies showing
that the CR enhances the neurogenesis. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the
effects of the mimetics on the neural stem cells and neurogenesis. The available

data indicate that the resveratrol has different effects on neurogenesis of a young
and healthy organism (Park et al. 2012) under various stress conditions (Madhyastha
et al. 2013; Moriya et al. 2011; Shen et al. 2016) and aging (Kumar et al. 2016).
Thus, the administration of the resveratrol (1–10 mg/kg) for 14 days inhibited the
proliferation and survival of the neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the dentate gyrus
of the hippocampus of the young C57BL/6 mice and reduced the levels of the phosphorylated form of the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (pCREB) and
the BDNF in the hippocampus (Park et al. 2012). While in healthy animals resveratrol suppressed the neurogenesis, in rats exposed to embryonic stress, the resveratrol
treatment increased the number of neonatal neurons in the hippocampus and the
BDNF expression (Madhyastha et al. 2013).
Resveratrol was also shown to stimulate the neurogenesis and mRNA expression
of the brain neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus of mice with chronic fatigue
(Pavlidouetal. 2019). *invitro*,theexposuretoresveratrolontheneuralstemcellsafter
the oxygen–glucose deprivation/reoxygenation leads to the increased cell survival
and proliferation, reduces apoptosis and the MDA levels, and also increases the SOD
activity, GSH content, and the expression of Nrf2, HO- 1, and NQO1 proteins (Li
et al. 2020). Resveratrol also exhibited a two-phase effect on NPCs under the culture
conditions (Kumar et al. 2016). While low concentrations of resveratrol (10 μM)
induced cell proliferation through the signal pathways associated with the signalregulated extracellular kinases (ERK) and p38 kinases phosphorylation, the high
concentrations (>20 μM) leveled these effects. The administration of resveratrol
(20 mg/kg body weight) to old rats (15 months) enhanced the neurogenesis in the
region of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (Kumar et al. 2016).
Numerous *in vitro* and *in vivo* studies have confirmed that metformin may be an
important regulator of the metabolism and functioning of the brain cells, including
the stem cells, and has a great potential in the treatment of the neurodegenerative
diseases (Markowicz-Piasecka et al. 2017; Jiang and Liu, 2020). Several studies have
shown the activation of the neural stem cells by metformin in the various injuries.
It has been shown that metformin causes an activation of the neural stem cells in

the spinal cord only in males, and the progenitor cells in both sexes. Exposure to
metformin resulted in the improved functional outcomes after trauma in the thoracic
spinal cord (Gilbert and Morshead, 2019).
On the other hand, in a study conducted by Ruddy et al. where it was shown that the
effect of metformin on the NPCs depended on sensitivity to sex hormones, especially
the estradiol, and only females increased the proliferation of progenitor cells. At the
same time, the neural stem cells and the neurogenesis were activated to the same
extent in both sexes in a model of neonatal stroke (Ruddy et al. 2019). In an another
study, it was demonstrated that administration of metformin for 7 days activates the
endogenous NPCs, expands the NPC pool, and aids migration and differentiation of
the NPCs in the damaged neonatal brain in a hypoxia-ischemic injury model (Dadwal
et al. 2015). Using the advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs) model of the
neuronal damage, metformin was shown to increase the survival of the human neural
stem cells (hNSC) and enhance the expression of the AMPK, PGC1α, NRF-1, and
Tfam (Chung et al. 2015).

25 Calorie Restriction Mimetics and Adult Stem Cells 539

Metformin preconditioning of the human induced pluripotent stem cells of the
neural stem cells prior to the brain transplantation damaged by stroke has also
been shown to improve their engraftment and regeneration and recovery after (OuldBrahim et al. 2018). Activation of the atypical PKC-CBP pathway, which enhances
the neurogenesis in the brain of the adult mice, is assumed to be signalling pathways involved in the regulation of the response to the metformin action on NPCs
(Wang et al. 2012). In addition, Fatt et al. revealed that the neuronal differentiation
of the NPCs extracted from the subventricular zone was enhanced by metformin and
depended on the activation of the AMPK-aPKC-CBP pathway (Fatt et al. 2015).
Also, the metformin treatment has recently been shown to result in rejuvenation of
the oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and the improvement of remyelination
in old animals after focal demyelination (Neumann et al. 2019).
The mTOR signaling pathway is a key in the neuronal and glial differentiation processes and the maintenance of the neural stem cell stemness (LiCausi and
Hartman 2018). Intra-cerebro-ventricular infusion of rapamycin (0.5 mM) into the
left ventricle of mice was shown to reduce the number of proliferating neural stem
cells for almost two times within 7 days (Paliouras et al. 2012). In addition, this study
showed that rapamycin suppresses the division and differentiation of the neural stem
cells *in vitro* and reduces both the size and the number of the neural stem cells grown
as neurospheres (Paliouras et al. 2012).
An interesting comparative study of the effect of rapamycin or metformin on the
proliferating neural precursor SVZ and DG cells was carried out in mice (Kusne
et al. 2014). A 9-week regimen of daily intraperitoneal (ip) injection of rapamycin
at a dose of 75 μg/kg (low dose) or 2.5 mg/kg (high dose) has been shown to
reduce the proliferation of the neural stem cells in the SVZ region of the brain of
adult C57BL/6 J., while a similar regimen of metformin administration at a dose of
200 mg/kg per day did not cause such an effect. A decrease in the proliferation and
differentiation was also found under the influence of rapamycin, but not metformin
(Kusne et al. 2014).
The study of the mTOR system in the brain during aging showed that the total
number of the neural stem cells and their proliferation in the hippocampus sharply
decreases with age and this correlates with a decrease in the activity of the mTOR
signalling in the old brain, including the NSC (Romine et al. 2015). It was shown that
a single injection of rapamycin (10 mg/kg) led to a significant decrease in the number
of proliferating cells in the hippocampus in young animals. Also, if activation of the
mTOR system with ketamine improved the neurogenesis in the hippocampus, then
the joint intraperitoneal injections of ketamine (10 mg/kg) and rapamycin (10 mg/kg)
to 12 month old mice reduced the level of proliferation (Romine et al. 2015). Collectively, these data indicate that the use of rapamycin may exacerbate brain aging, and
in this aspect the compound is not a calorie restriction mimetic.
Endogenous polyamines play an important role in the neural differentiation,
learning and memory (Guerra et al. 2016) and the levels of polyamines in the aging
brain gradually decrease as they age (Sigrist et al. 2014). Spermidine and spermin
have recently been shown to induce autophagy and inhibit brain aging in the SAMP8
mice (Xu et al. 2020). Perhaps this deceleration is also associated with the effect

of spermidine on the neural stem cells, as evidenced by another study, the cultivation of the NPC with spermidine, the cell migration was facilitated, the number of
neurites increased and the BDNF expression increased 7 days after the addition of
SPD (Signor et al. 2017).
Thus, some of the chemical compounds that are classified as the CRMs undoubtedly have the properties that allow them to mimic calorie restriction, including
through the mechanisms associated with the activation of the adult stem cells.
However, the impact of the CRMs on stem cells can be both positive and negative depending on the type of stem cells, which is associated with the heterogeneity
of the adult stem cells in the body. Moreover, the effects of the CRMs on stem cells
can be considered within the concept of hormesis, when the small doses of the CRMs
induced the activation of endogenous stem cells, while the large doses suppressed.
It should also be noted that the CRMs often have the antioxidant properties, and
in high doses they presumably can cause the so-called antioxidant stress in healthy
cells and disrupt a normal redox homeostasis, and this, on the contrary, can lead to
an accelerated aging (Kornienko et al. 2019).
Apart from that, the responses of the adult stem cells to the mimetics are age and
gender dependent, so that they vary greatly from positive to negative. In addition, the
state of a niche or tissue microenvironment has a strong influence on the functioning
of the adult stem cells, which, under the various stresses and diseases, can modulate
the effects of mimetics. The role of the microbiome, which may be involved in
mediating the effects of the CRMs on stem cells, remains unexplored. We believe
that this direction is the very promising in the development of a further strategy for
the use of mimetics. Therefore, further studies are required to determine the role
of metabolic reprogramming in the fate of stem cells with the help of mimetics. It
has to include more accurate and detailed characterization and understanding of the
molecular and cellular mechanisms of the aging process. Moreover, there is a need
to elucidate the interaction of the microbiome axis - stem cells and determine the

optimal concentrations of mimetics and their combinations. Finally, the search for
the new compounds with the most complete properties mimicking calorie restrictions
are needed.

##### **Chapter 26**
#### **Healthy Nutrition for Older People**

**Marios Kyriazis**

**Abstract** The role of nutrition in health has fascinated humans for millennia.

Currently, there is a substantial body of research guiding better practices to prevent or
treat age-related conditions through nutritional interventions. Chronic degenerative
conditions such as cardiovascular disease, sarcopenia and frailty, diabetes, cancer,
osteoporosis, prostatic hyperplasia, menopause, age-related macular degeneration
and many others, are amenable to nutritional interventions which, in association
with specific treatments, may help alleviate the burden of the disease. Nutritional
principles can also be applied for the prevention of each condition. In this chapter,
there is a presentation regarding some of these principles, mainly focusing on the
latest findings in each case. The aim is not to discuss all diets and nutrients suitable for each condition, but rather to use nutrition as a pretext to elucidate some
biological mechanisms and processes involved in age-related degeneration. Certain
intricacies of chronic degeneration, inflammation, oxidative damage and other agerelated processes are at the heart of this discussion, which also examines the action
of a number of nutrients or nutritional supplements. It is important to highlight that
due to the fact that age-related diseases are multifactorial, it is necessary to employ
a multi-pronged approach, tailored to the needs of each patient.

###### **26.1 Introduction**

Chronic degeneration leads to age-related diseases which, in turn, affect the normal
function of each one of us. From a clinical perspective, it is important for each
individual to be able to live and operate in an environment within the limits imposed
by physical, psychological and sociocultural challenges. If one is able to successfully
overcome these challenges, then this individual may ‘age successfully’ and function
well, to achieve their life goals. Although there are several elements which may M. Kyriazis ( B )

help us overcome successfully these life challenges, this chapter will focus on the
nutritional aspects.
Ageing, in other words, ‘time-related dysfunction’ (Kyriazis 2020), is associated
with an increased risk of certain conditions and diseases. Here we will discuss some

common ones: osteoarthritis, cardiovascular disease, cancer, age related macular
degeneration, menopause, osteoporosis, Parkinson’s disease, dementia, sarcopenia
and frailty, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. On some occasions, the nutrients
discussed here have been used since antiquity for their healthy-sustaining properties.
Modern science has attempted to elucidate the exact mechanisms of action, and how
these mechanisms may translate into concrete clinical benefits. In addition, many
nutrients exhibit hormetic, dose–response benefits, and this presents an opportunity
to discuss the increasingly important phenomenon of hormesis (Rattan and Kyriazis
2019). Below is a presentation highlighting certain advantages of nutrients, as these
may be used against age-related conditions. The presentation is in no particular order,
but aims to be balanced, provides a stimulus for further exploration, and covers most
such conditions.
###### **26.2 Osteoarthritis**

At the heart of osteoarthritic (OA) changes is chronic inflammation. Therefore, nutritionalproductswhichregulateinflammationshouldprovidebenefit,bothwithregards
to anatomical changes and clinical symptoms. One example is the case of catechins,
chiefly found in green tea. Green tea catechins downregulate several inflammation
processes and upregulate anabolic factors (Reddy et al. 2020). It was also shown that
catechins can modulate miRNA expression and improve collagen protection (Luk
et al. 2020).
In addition to the catechins, the role of dietary fatty acids is increasingly being
recognized. In a 16-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study examining the effects of fish oil (2000 mg/day docosahexaenoic acid plus 400 mg/day
eicosapentaenoic acid), it was found that these oils improve the pain of OA in overweight patients (Kuszewski et al. 2020). Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids
is associated with decreased pain and improvement of function, through modulation
of apoptosis, reduction of oxidative stress and a decrease in prostaglandin production
(Loef et al. 2019). One of the actions of docosahexaenoic acid, i.e. modulation of
apoptosis, has been observed in OA cell models (Xu et al. 2019).
Another nutritional agent, which can have some benefit in OA is resveratrol,
acting as an anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative factor. Resveratrol modulates the function of the TLR4/Akt/FoxO1 axis which is involved in inflammation. Specifically,
it upregulates phosphoinositide-3-kinase-Akt (PI3K/Akt) phosphorylation, inactivates FoxO1, and reduces Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and inflammation activity
(Xu et al. 2020). In a model of temporomandibular osteoarthritis, treatment with
resveratrol was found to be associated with prevention of inflammation, reduction
of chondrocyte apoptosis, and overall reduction of cartilage destruction (Yuce et al.


-----

26 Healthy Nutrition for Older People 551

2020). Resveratrol is widely considered as having several beneficial actions in many
conditions, and it will be discussed again later.
Other nutritional agents which were found to benefit OA:

- Ginger (through inhibition of prostaglandins, acting as an agonist of vanilloid
nociceptor, and as antioxidation agent) (Rondanelli et al. 2020).

- Garcinia mangostana (a sweet, juicy tropical fruit) by targeting and suppressing
pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6, TNF-α, and INF- γ) and other factors
(NF-κB, STAT3, and COX-2) (Chiu et al. 2020). Extracts of this fruit could also be
beneficial in other conditions where inflammation plays a role (Tsai et al. 2020).

- Vitamin K. There are two types of this vitamin, namely vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) and vitamin K2 (a series of menaquinones) with some differences in properties. Vitamin K is known to be associated with modulation of chronic inflammation
and it can thus be of benefit, as a dietary supplement, in OA as well as in several
other age-related conditions (Simes et al. 2020). Vitamin K1 is found mostly in
green leafy vegetables (kale, spinach, lettuce, Swiss chard). Vitamin K2 is in meat,
dairy products, liver, eggs, and Japanese “natto,” (fermented soy beans).
###### **26.3 Cardiovascular Disease**

The nutritional approach into prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease in
older people is wide-ranging. Here, the discussion will revolve around only certain
aspects of this approach, presenting the latest research with regards to only a few
nutritional factors.

One relevant such factor is vitamin E, which reduces oxidative stress and inflammation during cardiovascular events. Studies show that vitamin E deficiency is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, although studies of vitamin E
supplementation in such events have not been definitive (Ziegler et al. 2020). It may
be the case that acute supplementation during myocardial infarction will yield better
results than chronic preventative consumption through the diet.
Another nutrient which plays a huge role in cardiovascular disease is the group
of omega-3 fatty acids already mentioned above. The role of omega-3 fatty acids
(such as eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid) is well recognized in
reducing inflammatory mediators (cytokines and leukotrienes) and atherosclerosis.
One of the mechanisms involved is reprogramming of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins
(TRLs) (Shibabaw 2020).
Studies of marine omega-3 fatty acids (1 g/d) and vitamin D3 (2000 IU/d) in
25 871 men aged over 50 and in women aged over 55 years for five years, did not
find significant benefits of vitamin D with regards to cardiovascular events, although
there was a reduction of total coronary risk from the marine fatty acids (Manson
et al. 2020). But, as vitamin D can be of benefit in other age-related conditions
(for instance osteoporosis), its role remains important. Nevertheless, omega-3 fatty
acids are being proven consistently beneficial in reducing the risk of cardiovascular
disease.

552 M. Kyriazis

An important subject that should be mentioned here is that of Calorie Restriction,
including the practice of Intermittent Fasting. This notion is crucial in ageing, and
can provide information regarding all age-related degenerative conditions. However,
it is something that can be practically difficult or impossible to apply on humans
as a daily practice. During a calorie restricted diet, the subject is fed approximately
30% (or other proportions) of the normal *ad libidum* diet, and this has been shown
to have a host of positive (as well as negative) effects on the organism. The effects
are evident when the total amount of calories is restricted, regardless of the diet
composition (Brandhorst and Longo 2019). Due to the fact that a routine calorie
restricted diet cannot be applied on an average human (due to practical restrictions,
hunger and other adverse effects), another pattern that can be of use is intermittent
fasting. A short-term ‘fasting-mimicking’ dietary approach is a periodic, low-calorie,
and low-protein dietary approach which can have the beneficial effects without the
adverse effects of a chronic and continuing calorie restricted diet (Crupi et al. 2020).
In more general terms, and leaving the subject of calorie restriction aside, adherence to a healthy dietary pattern is as significant as the contents of such a healthy diet.
Healthy dietary patterns are those generally low in red meat, salt, and refined sugars,
and high in oily fish, deep coloured fruit and vegetables, fibre, pulses, nuts, and whole
grains. However, importance should not be given on single nutrient approaches. A
more significant aspect is the wider dietary habits which involve consumption of
several foodgroups, over longperiods of time, rather thanepisodically. For instance, a
Westerntypedietarypatternhasahighercardiovascularrisk,comparedtoaconsistent
Mediterranean type diet (Najafi et al. 2020).
###### **26.4 Cancer**

It is beyond the scope of this chapter to discuss nutritional support for all cancers.
However, it may be interesting to give a glimpse into the role of certain nutrients
which, alone or in combination, could be used to improve cancer-related symptoms
or risks. The following is a short list:

- Coriolus versicolor, an edible medicinal mushroom, consumed mainly in China.
Two of its polysaccharides, namely CVPn and CVPa were shown to induce
nitric oxide production, phagocytosis and reduction of Tumour Necrosis Factor
(TNF) (Zhang et al. 2020). In other words, coriolus may exhibit increased
immunomodulation and thus be useful in inhibiting the growth of cancerous cells.

- Resveratrol in association with curcumin. In a recent study, the combination
of these two nutrients was found to enhance autophagy, modulate apoptosis
and provide protection against cancer both in vitro and in vivo (Patra et al.
2020). Resveratrol is abundant in red wine, blueberries and dark chocolate, while
curcumin is found turmeric. Both are also available in oral supplement form.

- L-carnosine (β-alanine, l-histidine). Found in red meat and game meat, carnosine
is a pluripotent agent with a host of effects. Apart from acting as an antioxidant and


-----

26 Healthy Nutrition for Older People 553

anti-glycator, it is a heavy metal chelator, and apoptosis modulator (Chmielewska
et al. 2020). It has been used against several degenerative conditions, such as
cataract, diabetes, cancer, neurodegeneration, and even schizophrenia (Banerjee
and Poddar 2020). Carnosine will be mentioned again below.

- Chrysin (5,7-dihydroxyflavone) is found in honey, propolis, and passion flower. It
exhibits antiproliferative activities and it can be used in association with conventional chemotherapy with cisplatin (Sherif et al. 2020). Its antineoplastic effect has
been studied with regards to cancers of the lung, breast, colon, cervix, stomach,
melanoma, and liver (Ganai et al. 2020), so it remains a promising agent.

The concept of calorie restriction mentioned above, can also be useful in the
general case of cancer. Through a restrictive dietary pattern, it may be possible to
activate autophagy, and this may have positive outcomes during chemotherapy. An
increased dependency of cancer cells on autophagy may be exploited through nutritional interventions, although research on humans is still unsatisfactory (Cozzo et al.
2020).Autophagyisaprocesswherebydysfunctionalorunnecessarycellularcomponents are eliminated by the cell, and this mechanism has gained increased attention
by researchers with regards to ageing. In any case, calorie restriction and/or intermittent fasting are known to exert benefits on insulin, IGF, cortisol, sexual hormones,
oxidation, inflammation, as well as on markers such as FOXO, AMPK and SIRT-1
(Longo and Fontana 2010).
It is clear from the above short discussion, that nutrition plays an important
role here and that research is confirming the beneficial action of several nutrients.
However, it is also important to mention that it is unlikely that any single nutrient will
have a noticeable effect. Best results may be obtained through a combinational nutritional approach, in association with other lifestyle measures, tailored specifically to
the individual.
###### **26.5 Age-Related Macular Degeneration**

The subject of nutrition features high in the list of prevention measures recommended for Age-Related Macular Degeneration (ARMD). It is worth remembering
that ARMD, together with glaucoma, are neurodegenerative conditions and are the
leading causes of blindness in older populations.
Research in ARMD over the past several decades has examined the action of
nutrients (vitamins/minerals/factors) such as vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, zinc,
lutein, zeaxanthin, copper and the polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid
(DHA) among others (Walchuk and Suh 2020). Some of the recommended nutrients may exhibit hormetic (Rattan and Demirovic 2009) benefits, being beneficial in low doses and detrimental in higher doses. The typical example is resveratrol which inhibits neovascularization, reduces reperfusion damage and improves
vascular serum biomarkers (Richer et al. 2013). Resveratrol is available mostly in
red wine (hormetic doses!) and as an oral supplement.

554 M. Kyriazis

Exogenous supplementation with NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) has
been found to play an important role both in therapy and in prevention (Cimaglia et al.
2020). NAD is a factor which regulates retinal cell metabolism and homeostasis, and
mechanisms involved in this respect are the induction of mitophagy and the regulation
of oxidative stress (Wei et al. 2019).
Several other nutritional manipulations have been associated with a decreased risk
of ARMD. For example, a decreased omega-6/omega-3 ratio protects against neovascular ARMD (Mance et al. 2011). It has been suggested that a omega-6/omega-3 ratio
of 1 is the normal evolutionary ideal for health, whereas in Western diets this ratio is
as high as 15 to 1 (Simopoulos 2006). This increased ratio is associated with several
other chronic conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer and chronic
inflammation, as mentioned above. In this respect, increasing the intake of omega-3
fattyacidsshouldbetheaimofdietaryinterventions.Thereforadietrichincold-water
fatty fish (herring, tuna, sardines, salmon, and mackerel), in seeds/nuts (walnuts,
flaxseed, soya bean, canola) or in the form of oral supplements, has been recommended (National Institute of Health, Office of Dietary Supplements https://ods.od.
nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-Consumer/, retrieved 20 January 2021).
Certain alternative interventions may also be of some use. A retrospective singlegroup study using a treatment modality based on intravenous nutrition in association
with microcurrent stimulation and light therapy was found useful (Kondrot 2015).
The authors of this study found significant improvements in visual acuity contrast
and visual fields.
There are foods that are best avoided in ARMD. Examples include processed
foods that contain trans fats, palm oil, lard, vegetable shortening, and margarine.
High-fat dairy foods, fatty beef, pork and lamb are also to be avoided.
###### **26.6 Menopausal Symptoms**

Nutritional support for menopausal problems has been the subject of a large number
of studies, for many decades. Nutrients or supplements studied include black cohosh,
flaxseed, calcium, red clover, vitamin D, and, of course, soya. The following is a short
comment on some of these, concentrating on the latest published research at the time
of writing.

- Black cohosh *(Actaea racemosa, Cimicifuga racemosa).* In a systematic study it
was found that black cohosh extract was significantly better than placebo in the
treatment of menopausal symptoms, with no significant adverse effects (CasteloBranco et al. 2020).

- Flaxseed. A very interesting study explored the relationship between lignan-rich
oilseeds such as flaxseed oil, and the gut microbiota. The study showed that such
oilseeds interact with faecal microbiota in premenopausal women and, through
modulation of enterolignans, act as a substitute for human oestrogen (Corona et al.
2020). This leads to a better clinical profile, reducing menopausal symptoms.


-----

26 Healthy Nutrition for Older People 555

- Soya genistein (Thangavel et al. 2019). One of the best studied elements of soya is
the group of isoflavones (phytoestrogens), and specifically genistein. This forms
a large part of the isoflavone content of soya, perhaps as high as 60%. Genistein improves glucose metabolism, induces apoptosis in cancer, has antioxidant
effects, and modulates postmenopausal symptoms such as hot flushes, anxiety
and depression.

Polyphenols (isoflavones, genistein etc.) exhibit a hormetic, biphasic dose–
response activity. In other words, they are beneficial in low dose and detrimental
in higher doses, having only a defined window of positive result, beyond which they
become detrimental (Leri et al. 2020).
Apart from nutrients used to alleviate symptoms of the menopause itself, it is also
necessary to consider nutrients which are of benefit in conditions associated with
the menopause, such as osteoporosis. Vitamin D status can affect both menopausal
symptoms and osteoporosis, as mentioned below. Dietary macronutrients such as
vitamin D consumption may have a positive effect in this respect. It is known that
serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration is correlated with menopausal status, and
that oral consumption of vitamin D may be able to modify any adverse effects associated with the menopause (Chun et al. 2020). Sources of dietary vitamin D include
fish such as salmon, sardines, herring and mackerel, red meat and liver, egg yolks
and specially fortified foods, and of course, as oral dietary supplements. It is worth
mentioning at this point that vitamin D deficiency is widespread, including (paradoxically) in countries where there are long periods of sunlight. Levels of 25(OH)D
below 30 nmol/L are encountered in over 20% of the population in India, Tunisia,
Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Specifically, in India, it is estimated that half a billion
people may have low vitamin D levels (Cashman 2020).
###### **26.7 Osteoporosis**

The case of osteoporosis is an example of the complexity of ageing, in the sense that it
is not just one disease related to degeneration, but its presence is associated with other
conditions affecting the elderly, such as frailty, falls, mobility problems, pain etc. In
addition, it is an example of how a multifactorial approach to treatment is necessary.
It is not enough to employ only a dietary or a pharmacological approach, but several
other interventions need to be used in association, e.g. physical exercise, hormonal
manipulation, and appropriate lifestyle measures. This underlines the requirement
to deal with ageing in a multidisciplinary fashion, where treatment of one condition may have secondary beneficial effects on another. In any case, nutrition does
play a significant role here, as obesity and osteoporosis are interrelated, and as it is
known that the Western diet with its saturated fat content does influence osteoporosis
(Martyniak et al. 2020). In this respect, polyunsaturated fats in the diet are beneficial
because these reduce bone loss and enhance osteogenesis (Bao et al. 2020). Certain

other nutrients do have a proven benefit, and these include minerals (calcium, phosphorus and magnesium), vitamin D, vitamin B12 (Kalimeri et al. 2020) protein rich
foods, fibre, fruits and vegetables, and prebiotic foods (Ilesanmi-Oyelere and Kruger
2020).
Other studies have shown the benefit of tomato (green tomato extract) which
improves bone formation through Bmp2-Smad 1/5/8-Runx2 signaling, and modulate
the nuclear factor kappa-B (RANKL)/osteoprogeterin (OPG) pathway, which in turn
improves bone resorption (Nirmala et al. 2020). It is an opportunity here to mention
that BMPs (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins), are members of the TGF-β superfamily,
which have strong osteogenic activity and stimulate mesenchymal osteoprogenitor
cells to become mature osteoblasts. This shows that nutritional factors may indeed
modulate bone metabolism, therefore a wise dietary choice should have a positive
therapeutic result.
A relevant vitamin not usually considered by nutritionists in osteoporosis, is
vitamin K. This vitamin plays a role in cardiovascular health and in bone development, as already mentioned above in the case of osteoarthritis. The National Academy
of Science (Food and Nutrition Board), has determined that the dietary requirements
of healthy people are around 100 ug/day, but the requirements in older people with
chronic degenerative conditions could be different. There is an intricate relationship between vitamin K, gut microbiota and osteoporosis. Certain intestinal bacteria
produce vitamin K and thus affect bone metabolism, bone composition and, ultimately, fracture risk. The most relevant bacteria in this respect are those of the genus
Bacteroides (fracture risk increases as their concentration decreases), and those of the
Rikenellaceae family (Ozaki et al. 2020). Therefore, it is important to maintain good
intestinal flora through use of probiotics (BOX 1). This will not only have an effect
on bowel health but can also affect bone and even neuronal health, as mentioned

below in the case of dementia.
###### **26.8 Alzheimer’s Disease**

Among other factors, inflammation, and one of its markers, Tumor Necrosis Factor
alpha (TNFα), have been implicated in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). A high-fat diet
increases expression of TNFα in the tissues but this does not necessarily translate
into a worsening cognition score (Jackson et al. 2020). There are multiple factors
and processes contributing to AD and it would be simplistic to claim that a suitable nutrition will inevitably lead to a reduced risk of the disease. Nevertheless, it
is possible to discuss some dietary factors that could possibly be useful, both in
prevention and in patients with established AD. For instance, resveratrol could be of
benefit, particularly if combined with physical exercise. The mechanism here could
be due to resveratrol’s effects on apoptosis, neuroinflammation and reduction of Aβ
oligomers (brain amyloid-beta) (Broderick et al. 2020).
Enhancing mitophagy will be mentioned below, in the case of Parkinson’s disease.
However, mitophagy is also implicated in other neurodegenerative diseases including


-----

26 Healthy Nutrition for Older People 557

Alzheimer’s Disease. During mitophagy there is elimination of age-damaged mitochondria. Nutrients such as resveratrol, curcumin, astaxanthin and spermidine (which
are found in the Mediterranean and Okinawan diets), are increasingly being promoted
as effective in enhancing mitophagy (Varghese et al. 2020).
Therelationshipbetweenthegutmicrobiotaandchronicneurodegenerativeconditionsisincreasinglybeingrecognized,andhasbeenbrieflymentionedabove.Dysregulation of the function of gut microbiota, affects the gut-brain axis and has repercussions on neurological function (Zhu et al. 2020). Therefore, maintaining an effective
balance and function of the gut microbiota, usually through nutritional manipulations, should result in a decreased risk of neurodegeneration, including Alzheimer’s
dementia (Kowalski and Mulak 2019) (BOX 1). For instance, ketogenic diets and
intermittent fasting were found to have an effect on Alzheimer’s disease, at least in a
rat model (Park et al. 2020). In this study it was found that intermittent fasting and a
diet high in starch may decrease the progress of dementia. It is, however, suggested
that because there is a great variation in the gut microbiota between people, it is
necessary to tailor-made each intervention to optimally suit each individual.

*******************************************************************

BOX 1

Ways to improve gut microbiota include (Valdes et al. 2018):

- Probiotics (Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species)

- Dietary fibre

- Avoidance of antibiotics, pesticides, and food additives, such as emulsifiers

- Fermented foods such as kimchi (fermented cabbage), sauerkraut, κombucha (a
fermented beverage of black tea and sugar), kefir (fermented milk product), miso
(fermented soybean, barley or brown rice), tempeh (fermented soybean product),
raw cheeses made from unpasteurized milk, and Greek yogurt.

*******************************************************************

The potential of carnosine against chronic degeneration has already been
mentioned above, but it is worth returning to this nutrient as it appears to have a
confirmed anti-neurodegenerative action (Schön et al. 2019). Carnosine is available in red meat and also as an over-the-counter food supplement. It can cross the
blood-brain barrier, reduces amyloid beta polymerization, and decreases aggregates
of amyloid. In addition, carnosine protects brain vascular endothelial cells (RBE4)
against toxicity induced by beta amyloid, and modulates brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) in some animal models (Schön et al.
2019). Overall, it optimizes energy metabolism, improves the function of mitochondria in neurons and acts as a suppressor of chronic neurodegeneration, making it
an ideal nutritional supplement in age-related brain diseases (Banerjee and Poddar
2020).
Also, at this point it is worth mentioning that a patient suffering from dementia
is more likely to be frail, weak, and sarcopenic, with other concomitant conditions.
It is therefore important to consider all aspects of health in this type of patient and
establish a nutritional program suited to the specific (not the general) needs of each
such patient.

###### **26.9 Parkinson’s Disease**

Conditions which can contribute to the pathology of Parkinson’s disease (PD) may
include dysbiosis due to dietary habits, and increased intestinal permeability (Lister
2020). It may thus be possible to alter the progression of the disease by suitable
manipulation of these nutrition-related conditions. Principal factors in this respect
could be the status of vitamin D and B complex, omega fatty acids, probiotics and
coenzyme Q10.
An interesting approach in Parkinson’s disease is to modulate mitophagy, in
other words, the elimination of damaged mitochondria, through nutritional factors.
We know that there is mitochondrial dysfunction in dopaminergic neurons in PD,
therefore any measures which may result in improved mitophagy may lead to an
improvement in clinical symptoms. Promotion of mitophagy can be achieved through
boosting of Parkin, a ubiquitin ligase, by consuming a low protein, plant-based diet
(McCarty and Lerner 2020). This could be one of the reasons why East Asian and
sub-Saharan Africa diets (mostly vegan) have a decreased risk of PD compared to
the high protein diets of Western countries.
A diet rich in spermidine may also enhance mitophagy (Yang et al. 2020). Spermidine can be found in the components of the Mediterranean diet such as mushrooms,
legumes, and whole grains, as well as in soy and corn. The role of spermidine in
protecting against neurodegeneration in general (not only PD but also Alzheimer’s
disease, and ageing degeneration) is important and is slowly but increasingly being
elucidated.

Hydrogensulfide(HS)isasignalingmoleculewithmultipleactions,anditexhibits
typical hormetic properties. It provides protection against oxidative damage and it
is also a cytoprotector. It plays a positive role in neurogenesis (Sun et al. 2020).
N-acetylcysteine and methionine are precursors of HS, and are available in oral
supplements. However, HS acts in a hormetic manner, meaning that while low doses
can be of benefit, higher doses may be detrimental (Calabrese et al. 2010).
In addition, in PD there is generation of cytotoxic factors (such as peroxynitrite)
by microglia, which then cause dysfunction of dopaminergic neurons. It has been
suggested that modulation of peroxynitrite through nutritional factors may translate
into clinical benefit in PD (McCarty and Lerner 2020). Compounds which may play
a role in this respect include spirulina, vitamin D, caffeine, probiotics, promotion of
hydrogen sulfide (taurine, N-acetylcysteine) and generally low-protein diets which
may also help in improving response to levodopa drug therapy (Guebila and Thiele
2016).
Certain plant alkaloids, such as palmatine, have exhibited inhibition activities
against anti-acetylcholinesterase, and are thus being studied further with regards
to their phytotherapeutic effects against Parkinson’s disease (Chaves et al. 2020).
Palmatine is found in extracts of the Coscinium fenestratum plant, for example. It has
several other health-improving properties, and it exhibits a hormetic, dose–response
activity – essentially acting as a hormetin (Long et al. 2019).

Studies of diet patterns show that ‘healthy’ diets (such as the Mediterranean
diet) are associated with a reduced incidence of prodromal symptoms of Parkinson’s
disease (Mosberry et al. 2020). Specifically, it was shown that increased adherence
to a Mediterranean diet is associated with a corresponding decrease in the risk of
non-motor prodromal symptoms of Parkinson’s disease in older people, such as
depression, constipation, urinary dysfunction and daytime somnolence (Maraki et al.
2019).
###### **26.10 Sarcopenia**

A common condition which contributes to physical frailty and falls in later life is
sarcopenia. It is a progressive condition where there is loss of skeletal muscle mass
and reduction of physical strength. Sarcopenia has been associated with low-grade
chronicinflammation,withabnormalitiesinproteinmetabolisminthemuscletissues,
and mitochondrial dysfunction. Clinically, it has been associated with several detrimental effects common in ageing, such as falls, hospitalization, chronic disability,
and institutionalization.

An interesting view is that dietary interventions may influence miRNAs in
muscle(myomiRNAs)whichregulatedevelopmentandmaintenanceofmuscletissue
(Barbiera et al. 2020). Dysregulation of myomiRNAs is found in ageing (Drummond
et al. 2008), and it has been shown that nutritional factors may play a positive role
here (Iannone et al. 2020). See BOX 2.

*******************************************************************

BOX 2

Nutrient-dependent miRNA regulation may be achieved with:

- Essential amino acids (EAAs), which increase miRNA function (Drummond et al.
2009)

- Glucose and amino acids (e.g. Leucine) (Chen et al. 2013)

- Albumin (Soeters et al. 2019)

*******************************************************************

There are several studies confirming that certain nutrients may impact positively
on sarcopenic patients. For instance, daily consumption of yogurt fortified with vitamins D (1000 IU) and C (500 mg) together with beta-Hydroxy beta-Methyl Butyrate
(3 g) for 12 weeks in a randomized, double-blind controlled manner, was found to
improve muscle strength and anabolic functions in older patients with sarcopenia
(Nasimi et al. 2020). The role of beta-Hydroxy beta-Methyl Butyrate (HMB) in
building muscle mass in sarcopenia is intriguing. It is a metabolite of leucine which
regulates muscular protein synthesis and has a host of other actions (Cruz-Jentoft
2018). For instance, it:

- Decreases muscle cell apoptosis

- Stabilizes cell membranes

- Inhibits the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, thus reducing proteolysis


-----

560 M. Kyriazis

- Enhances proliferation and differentiation of stem cells in muscle

- May prevent muscle loss in bed-ridden patients who cannot exercise

Therefore, although more studies are needed in order to confirm solidly the effects
of HMB, it is fair to suggest that its use can help older people with sarcopenia, by
improving lean muscle mass, muscle strength and physical function (Oktaviana et al.
2019). This nutrient is usually taken by mouth in powder form.
Royal jelly is another nutrient which may be helpful in sarcopenia. It delays
muscular functional decline during ageing and prevents muscle fiber atrophy
(Shirakawa et al. 2020). Royal jelly, and other bee products such as propolis and
bee pollen, are rich in antioxidants with strong action, including flavonoids and
phenols, as well as being rich in several amino acids. These can modulate inflammatory response and decrease oxidative and glycation stress in muscular tissues,
reduce catabolic activity, improve stem-cell function, improve AMPK metabolism,
and enhance muscle protein synthesis (Ali and Kunugi 2020).
The activity of AMPK (5’-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) is
one of the most interesting subjects in the field of ageing. AMPK controls muscle
metabolism and modulates anabolic and catabolic events. It improves muscle mass
and muscle tissue regeneration (Thomson 2018). It is known that obesity is associated
with a reduced AMPK function, although chronic activation of AMPK, is also found
in obesity and in impaired pancreatic function. We see once again that hormetic,
dose-response principles come into play, when long-term, indiscriminate activation
of AMPK is not necessarily beneficial and should be avoided (Lyons and Roche
2018).
###### **26.11 Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)**

Peanut sprouts (germinated peanuts) containing high amounts of resveratrol are eaten
in salads or in stir-fries usually in a vegetarian diet context. Extracts of the Yesan
sprout variety were found to affect molecular markers of BPH, such as 5α-reductase,
fibroblast growth factor, and the apoptotic markers Bcl-2, and Bax. In model rats,
the extract also reduced the size, weight and thickness of prostate (Song et al. 2020).
Nutritional habits which may affect zinc in men over 50 years old, can also affect
the risk of BPH. Zinc has consistently been shown to play an active role in BPH,
although it is not a simple matter of increasing the daily dietary amounts of zinc and
expecting to see clinical result. Zinc metabolism depends on factors that may promote
or hinder zinc absorption. These factors can be endogenous and/or exogenous, such
as drugs or a diet low in zinc (Sauer et al. 2020). Zinc exhibits a concentrationdependent effect on inflammation, oxidation and apoptosis, through modulation of
TNF-α and IL-6 (Hacioglu et al. 2020). Foods rich in zinc include oysters, red meat
and poultry, beans, nuts, and whole grains.


-----

26 Healthy Nutrition for Older People 561

Although it is known than cranberry extracts may have an effect on urinary tract
infections, little is known about its effect on BPH. In a model using male SpragueDawley rats treated with cranberry powder, it was found that the extract has a significant decreasing effect on prostate weight, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and 5-alpha
reductase (An et al. 2020).
An interesting nutrient and hormetin in the case of prostate, is ginger. Hormetins
are natural or synthetic compounds which can produce hormesis (Rattan and Kyriazis
2019). Ginger ( *Zingiber officinale Roscoe)* has numerous effects including antidiabetic, lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory actions. Its activities include apoptosis
modulation, improvement of autophagy, and cell regulation. In addition, ginger has
oestrogen-modulating effects which means that it can be beneficial in prostate hyperplasia, as well as in other conditions where oestrogen is involved (osteoporosis,
menopause and certain cancers) (Kiyama 2020).
###### **26.12 Conclusion**

Itisimportanttoadvisethepatientthatthereisnouniversaldietoranutritionalpattern
that can protect against all age-related diseases. Each disease, while sharing certain
common characteristics of ageing (for instance oxidation, inflammation, degeneration, and glycation), has to be seen separately and focused on the needs of each
particular patient. The principles of personalised medicine should be applied in all
aspects of nutritional interventions, both for prevention and for treatment. It is known
that diets which are generally considered ‘healthy’ in some countries (e.g. Mediterranean diet) may not be suited to the cultural, social or biological makeup of other
countries (Asia, for instance) (Moffat and Morell-Hart 2020). Therefore, a dietary
pattern has to be tailored individually to each patient, and be considered with other
lifestyle measures, specific to that patient. Nevertheless, there are certain pluripotent
nutrients that can be recommended in most conditions. Examples include resveratrol,
carnosine, omega-3 acids, and vitamins D, E and C.
Nutrition may help in the prevention and treatment of age-related degenerative conditions through modulation of oxidation, glycation, inflammation and cell
metabolism. It is not, however, the only important factor in these conditions, neither
it is an approach that can work on its own, separate from other lifestyle interventions. The interaction between nutrients and physical exercise, smoking and excess
alcohol, as well as genetic factors, play an intricate role in achieving optimal health
for the ageing patient. Research has clarified a great amount of basic biological
mechanisms of how this can be achieved. The study of these mechanisms provides
useful insights regarding the mechanisms of ageing, hormesis, and optimal clinical
function in ageing.

**Abstract** Prolonged inactivity, sedentary lifestyle and unbalanced nutrition predispose to weight gain and obesity, also termed as metabesity (metabolic obesity).
Deficient metabolic sugar processing, impaired brain energy generation, dysfunctional important pathways are risk factors in the pathogenesis of diabetes. Other
degenerative diseases, including neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular diseases can
make metabesity more complex. These may become aggravated over time owing
to several epigenetic factors, including fatty diet, lack of exercise, lack of adequate
sleep,sedentarylifestyle,alcohol,anddruguse.Metabesityisunderlinedbyvascularand neuro-inflammation, and encompasses a wide physiological and clinical manifestation. It is imperative to note that the existing interventions are only for the
management of diabetes, they are not curative. Secondary complications still occur
in many cases of diabetes. While continuous, concerted efforts go on to mitigate this
phenomenon, dietary manipulations and modulation remain a promising therapeutic
and lifestyle approach. The interrelationship between the central nervous system
(mainly the hypothalamus and the brain stem) and diabetes has been elucidated. The

hypothalamic neuronal and glial populations have been found to systemically regulate blood glucose levels in such a manner that the hypothalamic astrocytes capacity
for glucose sensing affect the overall glucose homeostasis. Inflammatory responses
rising from diabetes and obesity affects the astrocytes and the regulation of metabolic
hormones. Cancers are notorious for being voracious, and aggressively depicting
angiogenesis in order to amass available cell nutrients to themselves by all means
and at any cost. As a member of the inflammatory metabesity concept, especially
when metastatic, cancer angiogenesis is always to the detriment of normal apparently healthy cell populations within the systems of an organism. Should there be
one, or a comorbidity of any two or more of the illnesses consisting metabesity, how
may nutrition, nutrigenomics, nutraceuticals and/or functional foods be deployed to
regulate, manage, mitigate, treat and cure them. In this chapter, we attempt to answer
this question.
##### Keywords Metabesity · Nutrition · Inflammation · Gut · Brain
###### **27.1 Introduction**

The role of a balanced and regulated nutrition is crucial for health and longevity.
Imbalanced nutrition combined with prolonged inactivity and a sedentary lifestyle
predispose one to excessive weight gain and obesity, often termed as metabesity
within the general concept of metabolic syndrome. The balance between energy
intake (food consumption) and energy expenditure (basal metabolic rate, i.e.
biochemical processes required to maintain cellular viability, physical activity and
adaptive thermogenesis) is tightly regulated (Fall et al. 2013). A homeostatic network
maintains energy stores through a complex interplay between the feeding regulatory
centres in the central nervous system (CNS), particularly in the hypothalamus and
the regulated storage and mobilization of fat stores that maintains the body energy
stores (Calle et al. 2003). Thus, genes that encode the molecular components of this
system may underlie obesity and related disorders. (Nielsen et al. 2014; Calle et al.
2003; Hu 2007).
Metabolic syndrome is generally perceived as an important health problem
regarding cardiovascular health, and with the concept of metabesity more comprehensive definition has been proposed (Harville et al. 2012). It is a constellation of
risk factors that predisposes to an enhanced risk of Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The clustering of at least three of five risk factors, elevated blood
pressure, elevated fasting plasma glucose, high triglycerides, low HDL-cholesterol
and increased body weight, have been variously described to constitute the metabolic
syndrome. Obesity and diabetes mellitus remain the leading causes of reduced health
span and life span throughout the world. Hence, it is not surprising that these areas are
atthecenterofhighlyactiveareasofresearch.Theidentificationofnovelmechanisms
underlying these metabolic disorders sets the stage for uncovering new potential therapeutic strategies. Obesity is a complex and chronic non-communicable disease that

affects more than a third of the world’s population (Hruby and Hu 2015). It has been
shown that obesity in middle age can shorten life expectancy by 4–7 years (Peeters
et al. 2003).
Metabesity refers to metabolic aberrations associated with obesity. These include
low-grade inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and changes in gut microbiome.
Along with a genetic component, the phenotypes in metabesity are largely the result
of sedentary lifestyles and unhealthy eating habits (Nielsen et al. 2014). Metabesity
is associated with several co-morbidities including an increased risk for cardiovascular conditions like hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, and
sudden death. Insulin resistance, high blood pressure and glucose levels, visceral
adiposity, progressive atherosclerosis, dyslipidaemia and fatty liver are common in
obese individuals (Ha et al. 2018). Metabesity adversely impacts endocrine balances
in the body and increases the risk of degenerative conditions like dementia.
Metabesity is an impending epidemic of huge public health implications with
enormous clinical, socioeconomic, and humanistic burdens. Interventions to combat
sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy eating should be introduced early in life to prevent
the onset and progression of metabesity (Cuffe et al. 2018).
###### **27.2 Pathophysiology of Metabesity**

Aging itself is largely a metabolic condition. As we get older, the day-to-day operations of metabolism inflict damage on human cells and organs. Moreover, as this
damage accumulates, metabolism itself is thrown into disarray and these things are
no longer coordinated with each other, causing metabolism to malfunction further
and inflict even the more damage (Davies et al. 2019). Among the many signs of
metabolic discoordination is a buildup of visceral fat, which may be partly a symptom
and partly a cause of aging. It is well known that carrying excess visceral fat tissue
in various ways increases risk of age-related diseases, shortens life expectancy, and
raises lifetime medical expenditure (Kay et al. 2016). Aging, therefore, along with
diabetes, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer, is itself an additional component of metabesity (Kay et al. 2016). It is also well known that the
western diet and lifestyle similarly contribute to the same metabolic dysfunction and
contribute to signs of premature aging. So given how intimately connected aging,
metabesity and disease are, seeking to address the metabolic roots of various diseases
might also lead to the discovery of the methods for improving the aging process itself,
with positive ramifications for everything from obesity to arthritis. Of all the major
health threats to emerge, none has challenged the very foundations of public health
so profoundly as the rise of chronic non-communicable diseases (Salehi et al. 2017).
Heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases, once linked only to
affluent societies, are now global, and the poor suffer the most. These diseases share
four risk factors: tobacco use, excessive use of alcohol, unhealthy diets, and physical
inactivity thus leading to metabesity (Davies et al. 2019). The action of insulin in

lowering blood glucose levels results from the suppression of hepatic glucose production and the increased glucose uptake into muscle and adipose tissue via GLUT4
contribute greatly to metabesity (Hruby and Hu 2015). Muscle has long been considered the major site of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in vivo, with adipose tissue
contributing relatively little to total body glucose disposal. On the other hand, various
transgenic studies have raised the possibility of a greater role for glucose uptake into
fat in systemic glucose homeostasis. Over-expression of GLUT4 selectively in fat
tissue enhances whole body insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance (Shepherd and
Kahn 1999) and knocking out GLUT4 selectively from fat tissue results in a degree
of insulin resistance similar to that seen with muscle-specific knockout of GLUT4. In
all forms of obesity, there is downregulation of GLUT4, a major factor contributing to
the impaired insulin-stimulated glucose transport in adipocytes leading to the onset
of metabesity (Fig. 27.1) (Shepherd and Kahn 1999). However, in the skeletal muscle
of obese humans, GLUT4 expression is normal. It has also been suggested that defective glucose transport may be due to impaired translocation, docking, or fusion of
GLUT4-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane (Tozzo et al. 1997). “With
obesity, there is reduced glucose disposal in adipose tissue. It has been suggested that
obesity leads to the development of hyperglycemia, hyperlipemia, hyperinsulinemia,
and insulin resistance. Molecules like FFA, leptin, or TNF-α, all of which are released
from adipose tissue, are known to affect glucose homeostasis indirectly (Fig. 27.1).

Undoubtedly there are other, as yet undiscovered, molecules from adipose tissue
that influence systemic metabolism. Obesity is associated with increased basal lipolysis in adipose tissue, and elevated circulating free fatty acids”. Acute-phase serum
amyloid A (SAA), a lipolytic adipokine in humans, stimulates basal lipolysis (Cuffe
et al. 2018). The lipolysis has been postulated to be an autocrine feedback mechanism by which increased SAA production from enlarged adipocytes A into the
circulation may contribute to insulin resistance. The SAA act through the CLA-1
and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway to stimulate lipolysis directly. Alternatively, increased lipolysis by SAA may be indirect, i.e. through
the stimulation of the lipolytic cytokines viz IL-6 and TNF-α. (Hinney et al. 2010).
Plasma triglyceride (TG) concentration is another metabolic variable, most affected
in obesity. It has been suggested that there is tissue resistance to insulin-mediated
glucose uptake, which in turn accelerates the very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL),
TG production rate and leads to endogenous hypertriglyceridemia. In obesity there is
decreased Lipoprotein lipase-mediated lipolysis of chylomicron-TG and ineffective
inhibition of hormone sensitive lipase-mediated lipolysis in adipose tissue (Cuffe
et al. 2018). SAA has also a direct effect on cholesterol metabolism. Being an
apolipoprotein by nature, it is the apoprotein of high-density lipoprotein (HDL).
The inter-action of SAA with HDL may impair the function of HDL as an antiatherogenic molecule and facilitate its degradation contributing to the occurrence of
metabesity (Harville et al. 2012). Adipose tissue-derived proteins have been defined
as adipokines, and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation in obesity (Fig. 27.1). The study of adipose tissue on inflammation was considerably impacted by the demonstration of resident macrophages in adipose tissue.
The possible mechanisms underlying the infiltration of macrophages into adipose
tissue may be the chemokines by adipocytes, which would then attract resident
macrophages. Recent studies have suggested that macrophages infiltrate adipose
tissue as part of a scavenger function in response to adipocyte necrosis (Heymsfield
andWadden 2017;laFleurandSerlie 2014).Obesityisassociatedwithelevatedlevels
of circulating proinflammatory cytokines such as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1
(PAI-1), C-reactive protein (CRP), TNF-α, and IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant
protein-1 (MCP-1). PAI-1 is elevated in subjects with metabolic complications of
obesity, and is expressed in the stromal fraction of adipose tissue, including endothelial cells. The cell types involved in the inflammatory response in obesity are not fully
delineated. Recent attention has focused on adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) as
a mediator of inflammatory responses in adipose tissue. In addition to the production
of pro-inflammatory cytokines that promote metabolic complications, adipose tissue
is the sole source of adiponectin, which is anti-inflammatory and associated with
protection from atherosclerosis (Shepherd et al. 1993).

###### **27.3 Risk Factors of Metabesity** ***27.3.1 Lipotoxicity***

Excessive accumulation of lipids (intracellular lipid accumulation) in tissues other
than adipose tissue beyond the ability of the tissues to oxidize them, leads to cellular
dysfunction which is commonly known as lipotoxicity, a crucial condition in the
pathogenesis of diabetes as one of the underlining factors in insulin resistance and
favours gradual atrophy of beta *(* β *)* cells in the pancreas. Amplified plasma concentrations of free fatty acids associated with obesity occurred as a result of excessive accumulation by tissues (liver, pancreas, skeletal muscles) connected with glucose homeostasis regulation. Visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues are the main origins of
free fatty acids (Belfort et al. 2005), but the latter release free fatty acids faster than
the former (Bjorntorp 1991). Triacylglycerols have been assumed to be the only lipid
that causes insulin resistance; however, recent approaches have focused on bioactive
lipids that can alter the enzymatic activities in insulin metabolism. Diacylglycerols
areexamplesoflipidsthatcanaltertheinsulinpathwayandtheyformedinacellviade
novo synthesis or through the breakdown of phospholipids (Yu et al. 2002; SchmitzPeir 2002). They are also vital second messengers implicated in the regulation of
intracellular activities which include signal transduction, differentiation, and proliferation. Despite their usefulness, undue accumulation of diacylglycerols enhances
the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) that causes aberrant insulin signaling which
leads to impaired GLUT4 translocation to the cell membrane. Overexpression of
glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 1 which catalyzed the acylation of glycerol-3phosphateduringthesynthesisofdiacylglycerols,hasbeenreportedtocausesteatosis
and increased insulin resistance (Bednarski et al. 2016). Long-chain acyl-CoA are
examples of lipids that can alter the insulin pathway (Hulver et al. 2003; Ellis et al.
2000). The previous report documented that a marked increase in long-chain acylCoA levels were observed in the liver, skeletal and adipose tissues of obese people
(Blachnio-Zabielska et al. 2012). Activated long-chain acyl-CoAs serve as substrates
in β-oxidation and in the synthesis of other lipids such as ceramides, diacylglycerols,
and triacylglycerols (Cronan, 1997) and has been reported to activates protein kinase
C which enhances serine phosphorylation at 307 (Ser307) in IRS-1. This further
inhibited phosphorylation of tyrosine in the insulin receptor and enhance phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) activation required for insulin action (Tomas et al. 2002;
Itani et al. 2002). ***27.3.2 Lipid***

Excess energy in the form of triglycerides is stored mainly in the adipose tissue.
These lipids are stored during energy balance as lipid droplets of adipocytes through
hyperplasia (increase in number of adipocyte) or hypertrophy (enlarge the size of


-----

27 Nutritional Regulation of Metabesity 573

adipocytes) (Hausman et al. 2001). Obesity has been linked with adipose tissue
dysfunction induced by hypertrophy and it has been proposed to be crucial in the
pathogenesis of metabolic diseases such as insulin resistance (Wang et al. 2005; Kim
et al. 2007; Weyer et al. 2000). During physical exercise and shortage of energy in
the body, free fatty acids are produced through lipolysis of the triglycerides stored
in adipocytes. These free fatty acids are then transported through the circulatory
system to tissues where they are used as source of energy. Free fatty acids have
been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity-associated metabolic disturbances
particularly insulin resistance. Free fatty acids through the portal circulation can
directly enter the liver in obesity and increase hepatic free fatty acids level which in
turns enhance gluconeogenesis and lipid synthesis with insulin resistance in the liver
(Boden 1997). Peripheral insulin resistance in humans can be induced by elevated
level of circulating free fatty acids (Boden 1997; Kelley et al. 1993). Furthermore,
free fatty acids serve as ligands for the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) complex (Shi
et al. 2006) and activate cytokine secretion of macrophages (Suganami et al. 2005),
thereby influencing inflammation of adipose tissue which enhance obesity-induced
metabolic complications.
###### ***27.3.3 Adipokines***

Adipokines are referred to as the various kinds of adipose tissue-derived secretory
factors which are products of excess adiposity and adipocyte dysfunction. They also
play significant role in the pathogenesis and development of many metabolic diseases
through modification of inflammatory responses and alteration of lipid and glucose
and lipid homeostasis (Hauner 2005; Halberg et al. 2008). Adipokines can be classified based on their activities as insulin-sensitizing adipokines with anti-inflammatory
properties such as secreted frizzled-related protein 5 (SFRP5) and adiponectin; and
insulin resistance adipokines with pro-inflammatory activities such as angiopoietinlike protein 2, visfatin, retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4), plasminogen activator
inhibitor (PAI)-1, resistin, leptin, IL-18, IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1 (Hotamisligil
et al. 1993; Amrani et al. 1996; Sartipy and Loskutoff 2003; Rotter et al. 2003).

**27.3.3.1** **Leptin**

Leptin, a hormone produced in the adipose cells, is essential in the regulation of
energy homeostasis and is richly found in adipose tissue especially in adipocytes
(Friedman and Hallas 1998). It suppresses appetite and activates energy expenditure
(Friedman and Hallas 1998). In obese subjects, the level of Leptin mRNA expression
in the adipose tissue and its level in the circulation are increased (Considine et al.
1996; Kouidhi et al 2010). This increase may be due to the presence of leptin resistance (Friedman and Hallas 1998). Leptin, independent of actions on energy expenditure, food intake, or body weight, also performs crucial function in the regulation


-----

574 E. I. O. Ajayi et al.

of glucose homeostasis. Leptin regulates pancreatic β-cell activities and enhances
sensitivity of insulin in the skeletal muscle and liver (Marroqui et al. 2012). Furthermore, due to cytokine-like structure of leptin and its receptor being a member of
the class I cytokine receptor (gp130) superfamily, leptin has been proposed to have
pro-inflammatory activities (Paz-Filho et al. 2012). Leptin binds to its receptor to activatestheJanuskinase(JAK)/signaltransducersandactivatorsoftranscription(STAT)
signal transduction pathway which lead to its numerous functions. Leptin has been
reported to suppress the secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 and stimulates the secretion of IL-2 and IFN-γ which are pro-inflammatory cytokines (Lord
et al. 1998). Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines
(TNF-α, IL-1) has been documented to increase the level of Leptin mRNA expression
in the adipose tissue and circulating leptin level (Grunfeld et al. 1996).

**27.3.3.2** **MCP-1/CCL2 and Other Chemokines**

Chemokines and their receptors are significantly expressed in subcutaneous and
visceral adipose tissue in patients suffering obesity (Huber et al. 2008). They are
essential in selective recruitment of lymphocytes and monocytes. Migration and infiltrationofmonocytes/macrophagesaremainlyregulatedbymacrophagechemoattractantprotein-1/C–Cmotifchemokineligand2(MCP-1/CCL2).MCP-1/CCL2induces
inflammation in the adipose tissue by pulling in inflammatory cells from the blood
stream and its expression in the adipocytes related to adiposity (Deshmane et al.
2009). Over-secretion of MCP-1/CCL2 enhances recruiting process of macrophage
and exacerbates the metabolic phenotype in adipose tissue (Kanda et al. 2006; Kamei
et al. 2006). However, absence of MCP-1/CCL2 or its receptor lessens accumulation
of macrophages and prevent against insulin resistance (Kanda et al. 2006; Lumeng
et al. 2008). Adipocyte-derived MCP-1/CCL2 has been reported to induce inflammation in human adipose tissue without the involvement of leukocytes or macrophages,
even though many cells such as macrophages/leukocytes and adipocyte in adipose
tissue secrete MCP-1/CCL2 (Meijer et al. 2011). CXCL14, C-X-C motif chemokine
ligand 5 (CXCL5) and CCL5 are other examples of chemokines that have been implicated in obesity-induced insulin resistance and in the migration and infiltration of
monocytes/macrophages (Keophiphath et al. 2009; Chavey et al. 2009). In adipose
tissue of obese subjects, multiple chemokine ligands and receptors with inflammation
activities have reported (Tourniaire et al. 2013).

**27.3.3.3** **Tumour Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-α)**

Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) is another pro-inflammatory cytokine which
has been implicated in the development of insulin resistance and obesity (Hotamisligil et al. 1993). TNF α is produced by different kind of cells and tissues adipose
tissue (Hotamisligil et al. 1993), lymphocytes, macrophages, monocytes, and skeletal
muscles (Saghizadeh et al. 1996) and is involved in various physiological processes


-----

27 Nutritional Regulation of Metabesity 575

including inflammation. TNFα performs its activities through its two key receptors
(p50 and p75) with concomitant activation of serine kinases such as p38 MAPK, IκBα
kinase β (IKKβ), and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), which enhance transcription
and expression of different pro-inflammatory mediators (Wellen and Hotamisligil
2005). TNFα is also involved in the induction of insulin resistance via its influence on the regulation of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism when its operating in
an auto- or paracrine ways (Hotamisligil and Spiegelman 1994). Oversecretion of
TNFα due to increase in number of fatty acids in the cell was first established in
adipose tissue of obese and diabetic rodents (Hotamisligil et al. 1993). Although
adipocytes produce TNF-α in rodents but the secretion is weak in humans, a study
demonstrated positive correlation between insulin levels, obesity, and insulin resistance, and increased TNFα secretion in human adipocytes (Kem et al. 2001). In
human, despite improving the inflammatory status of healthy overweight subjects
with metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance, and eliminating the TNF-α, there is
no significant effect on the insulin resistance (Wascher et al. 2011). Similarly, treatment of human subjects with TNF-α antagonist did not enhance insulin sensitivity
in humans (Bernstein et al. 2006). These observations may be due to compensatory
effects of other pro-inflammatory cytokines. Meanwhile, many pro-inflammatory
cytokines secreted by adipose tissue such as IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1 have been implicated in in disrupting insulin signaling and cause metabolic dysregulation (McArdle
et al. 2013). TNF-α which is a component of inflammation pathway can activate
cytokine cascades (both antagonistic and synergistic reactions) which regulates the
production and expression of other hormones, cytokines and their receptors (Illei and
Lipsky 2000).
###### **27.4 The Significance of Metabesity in Other Degenerative** **Diseases** ***27.4.1 Metabesity and Diabetes***

Globally, the incidence of type 2 diabetes is estimated to be about 9.3% (463 million
people) in 2019, it is estimated to rise to 10.2% (578 million) by 2030 and 10.9%
(700 million) by 2045 (Saeedi et al. 2019). The link between metabesity and diabetes
can be understood by considering the link between obesity and diabetes in relation
to metabolism.

Obesity is a major risk factor for diabetes. Majority of patients who are obese have
an increased level of free fatty acids. It has been hypothesized that free fatty acids
may be an important link between obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (Hussain
et al. 2010). Wilkin et al. proposed one of the widely accepted theories that links
body mass index and obesity, the “accelerator hypothesis”.

endproducts,atheroscleroticplaques,dysfunctionalunfoldedproteinresponsemechanism are common in obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. A
cascade of events ensues that causes remodeling of protein structure and loss/gain
of function which over time imposes progressive acquired phenotypic changes
on the cells within the system. Once the extracellular matrix becomes gradually
compromised, ageing may set in.
###### ***27.4.2 Metabesity and Cardiovascular Diseases***

Obesity is one of the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. It has been associated with diseases such as atherosclerosis, myocardial infraction, heart failure,
cardiac arrhythmias amongst others (Poirier et al. 2006). Metabolic alterations in
lipid storage has been identified in both obesity and atherosclerosis due to accumulation of triglycerides and cholesterol in both disease conditions (Csige et al.
2018).
Cardiovascular events are manifestations of complications arising from underlying disease conditions such as an atherosclerosis, which in turn is characterized by
increased carotid plaques, among other cardiovascular challenges (Perez et al. 2019).
Carotid plaques are more common and advanced in patients that have higher basal
metabolic indices than in those having apparently normal body weight (McGill et al.
2002). Inflammation is responsible for major cascades and events that precipitate
into atherosclerosis including endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerotic plaques etc.
(Shoelson et al. 2007).
Heart failure, another major cardiovascular event, seems to be increasing worldwide in terms of prevalence (Mozaffarian et al. 2015). Increase in body mass index is
correlated with increase in cardiovascular events in both men and women although
at different rates (Kenchaiah et al. 2002). Excessive weight potentiates increases in
aldosterone levels and the mineralocorticoid receptor expression, promoting interstitial cardiac fibrosiss, platelet aggregation, carotid plaques, blood pressure anomalies,
and endothelial dysfunction (Olivier et al. 2017).
Once diagnosed, close monitoring of the heart condition is essential in order
to avoid cardiovascular events rising from associated illnesses including obesity,
diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis (and palques), agimh and cancer. Different
models of atherosclerosis plaque measurement exist for ascertaining the extent of the
disease progression that may lead to local obstruction to or from the heart, vascular
inflammation, oedema, among others. ***27.4.3 Metabesity and Neurodegenerative Diseases***

Neurodegenerative diseases are increasingly becoming a cause of concern globally
owing majorly to morbidity, disability and a decrease in the quality of life resulting


-----

27 Nutritional Regulation of Metabesity 577

for their incidence and prevalence (Ashrafian et al. 2013). They include Alzheimer’s
disease, Hungtinton’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amylotipic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
amongst others. Protein glycation and protein glycation can affect protein folding
leading defects. Once misfolded, the proteins can aggregate, causing diseases such
as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease.
Thereisagrowingbodyofevidencethatincreaseinadiposityiscorrelatedwiththe
risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease as well as dementia. The risk of incidence of
Alzheimer’s disease and dementia has been correlated with midlife on set of obesity
(Whitmer et al. 2008; Gustafson 2006). Increased adiposity affects dysfunctional
glucose sensing, hyperinsulinaemia, and insulin resistance (Ashrafian et al. 2013).
Obesity has also been linked to dyslipidaemia, disordered fatty acid and cholesterol
metabolism. Taken together there is an underlying distortion in most biomolecules
in the body as a result of obesity especially in neurodegenerative disease conditions
(Ashrafian et al. 2013). It has also been observed that neurodegeneration was alleviated via amyloid clearance following the direct central administration of insulin to
the brain (Reger et al. 2006; Holscher 2012).
Parkinson’s disease, which is usually present in old age, is characterized by tremor,
dementia, muscle rigidity amongst other factors. Owing to the loss of dopaminergic
neuronsinthesubstantialnigra.Obesityleadstothedepletionofthestriataldopamine
receptors (Wang et al. 2001). An epidemiological study has also correlated obesity
and Parkinson’s disease as lean patients have a reduced risk of developing Parkinson
disease and most obese patients have a higher risk of developing Parkinson’s disease
(Abblott et al. 2002).
###### **27.5 Nutritional Intervention Against Metabesity** ***27.5.1 The Function of Macronutrients and Other Dietary*** ***Components***

Excess accumulation and storage of adipose tissue which is a condition of obesity
can be successfully ameliorated through special combinations of macronutrient. The
classes of food (lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins) have different energy metabolism
thus, total calories contents of macronutrients in diets that will cause changes in
body composition and enhance weight loss must be considered. Moreover, altering
the macronutrient composition of isocaloric diets may cause changes in their energy
density. The carbohydrate and protein balance must be maintained in the body due to
its limited ability to store protein and carbohydrate, and its immeasurable ability to
store fat (Flatt 1988). Dietary macronutrient can influence the body’s energy balance
base on the current energy status of the body (ie, in a positive, negative, or neutral
energy balance). Dietary intervention that improves weight loss and post–weight-loss
regain has been reported to be through employing dietary protein levels (25–35%
of energy as protein). High protein diets have been documented to reduce intake of


-----

578 E. I. O. Ajayi et al.

energy via modification of satiety hormones and enhance diet-induced thermogenesis which support a negative energy balance (Halton and Hu 2004; Paddon-Jones
et al. 2008; Abete et al. 2010; Pesta and Samuel 2014). High protein diets also
enhance weight management results in a randomized controlled trials and ecological studies (Due et al. 2004; Larsen et al. 2010; Ankarfeldt et al. 2014; Wycherley
et al. 2012). In clinical study, weight loss has been found across a wide range of
varying proportions of macronutrient compositions especially, modification of most
dietary recommended macronutrients (carbohydrates and fats) (Sacks et al. 2009).
Similarly, variation in response to dietary intervention has been attributed to the
wide interindividual differences in weight loss. For instance, insulin sensitivity is an
important in the weight loss response on low-carbohydrate or high-carbohydrate
diets. An improved response is observed in a low-carbohydrate against a highcarbohydrate diet in insulin-resistant, but not in insulin-sensitive individuals (Pittas
et al. 2005; Cornier et al. 2005; Ebbeling et al. 2007). In spite of these variations,
recent evidence indicates that the average weight loss responses to a wide range
of dietary macronutrient outlines and other dietary alterations are alike and largely
a function of compliance and the energy restriction achieved (Jensen et al. 2014).
Currently, managing energy balance is the most promising nutrition intervention
for obesity. The future direction will be to formulate and recommend personalized
nutrient patterns to address the specific needs of individual patients.
###### ***27.5.2 The Function of Bioactive Compounds***

Due to the upsurge in the prevalence of metabesity and associated complications,
plant derived diets have been employed in the treatment and management of obesity
owing to their abundant health benefits. Some medicinal plants contained bioactive
compounds that can be used to inhibit the pathogenesis of metabesity.

**27.5.2.1** **Effects of Bioactive Compounds in Tea**

Galactoatechin gallate (GCG), epicatechin (EC), epigallocatechin (EGC), galactatechin (GC), catechin (C), gallate (EGCG), and epigallocatechin are the substantial
bioactive components of green tea. Administration of EGCG to rats caused a decrease
on food intake and has been suggested to be helpful in weight management. Green
tea catechins (GTC) mitigated excess increase of liver and body weights through
the modulation of serum and liver triglyceride levels. Rats fed with GTC supplementation displayed a significant reduction in body weight (Yan et al. 2013). The
potential mechanisms of weight management effects attributed to green tea polyphenols include the ability of tea polyphenols to stimulate AMP-activated protein kinase
which is bioavailable in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver; and the ability of
components of tea to reduce calorie intake via decrease of the proteins’ and lipids’
absorption into the intestine.

27 Nutritional Regulation of Metabesity 579

**27.5.2.2** **Effects of Bioactive Compounds in Coffee and Green Coffee**

Chlorogenic acids, caffeolyl-feruloylquinic acid, p-coumaroylquinic acid, feruloylquinic acid, dicaffeoylquinic acid, caffeoylquinic acid, and methyl-xanthine
alkaloid caffeine are some of the significant bioactive components of coffee (Pan
et al. 2016; Burwell and Vilsack 2015). In a randomized controlled trial, weight
control was observed in 100 patients with obesity (25 males and 95 females) who
consumed of 3–5 cups/day of coffee for three weeks (Pan et al. 2016; Burwell and
Vilsack 2015). In another study using tablets of decaffeinated green coffee extract,
consumption coffee inhibited excess weight and accumulation (Martinez-Saez et al.
2014). Recently, green coffee bean extract markedly reduced fat mass and body
weight. It was noted that the antioxidant properties of coffee may have contributed
to the observed decrease in body fat and body weight (Tamara et al. 2011). Drinking
of coffee and green coffee significantly reduced excess weight and also markedly
reduced BMI, however, further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism via
which coffee elicit this health benefit.

**27.5.2.3** **Effects of Resveratrol**

Resveratrol is a polyphenolic phytoalexin isolated in many than 70 plant species and
is found in high proportion in the skin of red grapes. Dark chocolate, blueberries,
nuts, pomegranates, berries, and tea comprise of resveratrol in varying concentrations
(Diepvens et al. 2007). Resveratrol displays difference kinds of therapeutic benefits,
including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory (Xia et al. 2017). Resveratrol has been
reported to be an activator of sirtuin 1, a crucial molecular target regulating cellular
energy metabolism and mitochondrial homeostasis. Adenosine monophosphateactivated protein kinase (AMPK) is another important target of resveratrol, indicating that it can perform a critical function in regulation of energy homeostasis;
by stimulating AMPK, resveratrol demonstrates a lipid-lowering effect. Resveratrol
has potential anti-obesity effects by promoting lipolysis and β-oxidation, reducing
lipogenesis, decreasing proliferation of adipocytes, and suppressing differentiation
(Tomé-Carneiro et al. 2012).
Although the effects of resveratrol have been extensively explored in animal
models (Pereira et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2015), only few clinical studies have been
carried out, and the results are inconsistent. Furthermore, contrary to the substantial
preclinical discoveries of beneficial metabolic effects of resveratrol in an inflammation setting or obesity, the findings of human clinical trials of resveratrol effects
on obesity-related morbidities have been inconclusive. For instance, Timmers et al.
(2011)inacross-overstudyreportedthat150mg/dayofresveratroltreatmentreduced
serum inflammatory markers, increased energy expenditure, and decreased adipose
tissue lipolysis and plasma fatty acid and glycerol levels of obese men (Timmers et al.
2011). In another study, Resveratrol treatment did not improve hepatic lipid content,
blood pressure, glucose homeostasis, or inflammatory status in middle-aged men
with metabolic syndrome. On the contrary, it significantly increased total cholesterol


-----

580 E. I. O. Ajayi et al.

and LDL cholesterol (Kjær et al. 2017). In another clinical investigation, Konings
et al. (2014) examined the effects of 30 days resveratrol treatment (150 mg/day) on
the adipocyte size and gene expression patterns in obese men. It was documented
that resveratrol treatment decreased the size of abdominal subcutaneous adipocytes
(Konings et al. 2014).
Although, many beneficial effects have been reported in some clinical trials, but
with some conflicting information and discrepancies (Novelle et al. 2015). It has
been observed that resveratrol presents a dose–response hormesis in the biological models in which it has been tested, affecting several outcomes with medical
and therapeutic significance (Scapagnini et al. 2014). Arzola-Paniagua et al. (2016)
observed not significant decreases in leptin/adiponectin ratio, leptin, triglycerides,
fat mass, waist circumference, and BMI in obese individual’s treated with resveratrol
therapy. Resveratrol is used combined with other phytochemicals, too. For example,
twelve weeks of combined epigallocatechin-3-gallate and resveratrol supplementation increased mitochondrial capacity and stimulated fat oxidation in obese humans
(Most et al. 2016). However, another report reported that high levels of resveratrol
supplementation treatment had no effect on metabolic events, adipose tissue content,
and energy expenditure. Findings from a clinical study conducted by Poulsen et al.
(2013) were contrary to the anti-obesity potential of resveratrol in obese men; The
report documented that no effect was seen on inflammatory or metabolic biomarkers,
oxidation rates of lipid, blood pressure, ectopic or visceral fat content, or resting
energy expenditure (Poulsen et al. 2013).
Evidence from these limited clinical studies combined with the results from

in vitro and animal studies indicate that potential anti-obesity effects of resveratrol may be achieved through dietary supplementation. The differing results could
be due to the variable doses selected in the assays and to the different clinical backgrounds of the study subjects. However, the optimal doses and study period for the
anti-obesity potential of resveratrol remain to be determined (Kjær et al. 2017; Zhao
et al. 2017).

**27.5.2.4** **Effects of Quercetin**

Quercetin is a flavonoid and another active compound found in foods, fruit, wine,
apples, ginger, garlic, onions, and vegetables. There are several in vitro and in vivo
investigations aimed at elucidating the beneficial effects of quercetin in obesity, but
only little clinical findings were documented on human studies and clinical trials that
have been carried out to examine the effects of quercetin on obesity treatment (Chen
et al. 2016; Nabavi et al. 2015). A study assessed the effects of administration of
quercetin in overweight obese subjects with various apolipoprotein E genotypes; the
quercetin (150 mg/day/subject) decreased the waist circumference and triacylglycerol concentration (Pfeuffer et al. 2013). Quercetin supplementation offered beneficial effect against some risk factors of cardiovascular disease, though exerted slightly
pro-inflammatory effects (Pfeuffer et al. 2013; Brüll et al. 2015). Quercetin mitigated
oxidative stress in obese animal models, but Shanely et al. documented that quercetin


-----

27 Nutritional Regulation of Metabesity 581

(500 or 1000 mg/day/subject for 12 weeks) has no effect on oxidative stress and
antioxidant in obese subjects (Shanely et al. 2010). Presently, a clinical trial that is
still under phase II stage investigation, is exploring whether quercetin changes the
absorption of glucose by the body in obese subjects (Trails, 2003). Further studies
are needed to further examine the bioactive effects and bioavailability of quercetin.

**27.5.2.5** **Effects of Bioactive Compounds in** ***Curcuma longa***

The most bioactive compound in the *Curcuma longa* is curcumin. *Curcuma longa*
is one of the most used spice in India and other Asian states. It is the first records
about the turmeric as a useful medicine and has been consumed for many centuries
as medicine of Ayurveda, which means “science of long life”. Curcumin exhibits
many therapeutic and biological functions such as antiangiogenesis, antioxidation,
anticancer, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammation in different organs in the body
(Strimpakos and Sharma 2008; Aggarwal 2010). There are significant evidences
about potency of curcumin in enhancing and promoting β-oxidation, suppressing
fatty acid synthesis, and reducing fat storage (Bradford 2013; Jayarathne et al. 2017).
Scientific and clinical studies have demonstrated the health benefit effect of curcumin
in enhancing insulin sensitivity, modulating the bodyweight change (gain), and mitigating pathogenesis of diabetes (Ramirez-Bosca et al. 2000; Ramirez Boscáa et al.
2000; Panahi et al. 2016).
Unlike the studies on the effects of curcumin in cells or animals, studies on obese
subjects are limited. Mohammadi et al. (2013) documented the first clinical trial
using curcumin in obesity treatment. In the study, obese subjects were treated with a
commercial formulation of curcumin (1 g/day) supplemented with a bioavailability
enhancer, piperine, for a month. Even though there were no changes in body fat,
weight, or BMI, there is a marked reduction in serum triglyceride levels following
treatment with curcumin. this indicate that curcumin can influence and improve
insulin actions (Mohammadi et al. 2013). Furthermore, oral treatment of curcumin
supplementation(1g/day)for30dayssubstantiallyattenuatedoxidativestressburden
in obese individuals (Sahebkar et al. 2013). Curcumin supplementation had beneficial
effects on hip circumference, high-density lipoprotein levels, waist circumference,
body mass index, and triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein ratio in overweight and
obese female adolescents (Saraf-Bank et al. 2019).
In another study, 30-day treatment of curcumin (500 mg/day) decreased serum
levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-4 of obese patients (Ganjali et al.
2014). This suggests the anti-inflammatory activity of curcumin in obesity therapy.
In a randomized control trial carried out by Di Pierro et al. (2015), curcumin was
reported to decrease body weight and omental adipose tissue among overweight
people affected by metabolic syndrome. Taken together, studies have demonstrated
that curcumin exhibited anti-obesity and anti-inflammatory properties via adipose
tissue by reducing lipid storage, adiposity, and stimulating lipid oxidation (Zhao
et al. 2017). Although curcumin has been used in clinical trials, its multidimensional pharmacological properties, pharmacokinetics, and adverse effects in obesity


-----

582 E. I. O. Ajayi et al.

therapy need to be cautiously examined. A joint report of the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended
1 mg/kg body weight of curcumin as maximum daily usage (WHO 2000). Investigations into curcumin continues to provide novel insights into metabolic regulation
that may ultimately translate into effective therapy (Jin et al. 2018).
###### **27.6 Conclusion**

While taking care to apply nutritional interventions to prevent, mitigate, delay or
reduce metabesity, care must be taken to avoid aggravating the situation. Metabesity
may get out of control if nutrition becomes a source of dietary advanced glycation
end products (AGEs) of which Western diets, and modern-day foods may be replete
of, owing to mode the of cooking and the length of heat exposure, especially with
dry heat (including frying, grilling, toasting, baking, and barbecuing). Excessive
consumption of AGEs has been implicated in obesity, diabetes, inflammation, aging,
neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. Rather, low heat cooking (boiling,
steaming) withwater, rawconsumptionof organicplant-basedfoods or thoseexposed
to adequate cooking time, vegetarian or vegan diet may help improve gut function
and health, while ensuring the health of the brain, heart, kidney and other organs
affected by obesity and diabetes (diabesity) complications, and the interconnected
diseases with metabolic roots. Overall, this will serve to extend healthspan, and
healthy lifespan.

##### **Chapter 28**
#### **Why Ashwagandha for Healthy Ageing?** **Evidence from Cultured Human Cells**

**Renu Wadhwa, Sukant Garg, Mallika Khurana, and Sunil C. Kaul**

**Abstract** Ageing is an innate indispensable physiological process largely conceived
as general decline in body functions and defense mechanisms. While ageing per se
is not a disease, there are many age-related pathologies, modulation of which is
considered as anti-ageing in several ways. Chronic stress often triggers senescenceinducing mechanisms manifested as premature/rapid ageing. The latter is associated
with a high incidence of stress-related disorders such as cancer, neurodegeneration,
metabolic disorders and muscle/bone dysfunctions. Cell culture system provides an
easyandconvenientexperimentalsystemtostudymechanismsofnatural(replicative)
and stress-induced ageing. We, over the years, have researched molecular mechanisms of ageing and age-related pathologies, and their modulation with natural
compounds using cell culture as a model system. Among several others, bioactives
from Ashwagandha ( *Withania somnifera* ) have emerged as useful natural compounds
with a variety of activities and are hence predicted to assist in health care in stress and
disease states. In this chapter, we describe highlights of our research work demonstrating the therapeutic potential of Ashwagandha leaves that offer advantage over
roots in terms of availability, processing and being enriched with active compounds.
##### Keywords Ashwagandha · Stress · Protection · Cancer · Inhibition · QOL
###### **28.1 Introduction**

The word “ageing” possesses an inherent meaning of decline, at large. Globally
increase in ageing population and environmental stress are the two major concerns
in the modern society. It is largely seen as increasing incidence of a variety of
pathologies that severly affect quality of life (QOL) at all ages, but more apparent
in elderly populations. With parallel advancements in medicine and drug deveoplment, although most pathologies have new treatment opportunities, maintenance of R. Wadhwa ( B ) · S. Garg · M. Khurana · S. C. Kaul

QOL and healthy ageing remains relatively less explored aspect as yet. It has been
well documented that a good diet, supplements enriched with natural compounds
with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antistress ingredients help in maintaining
the body homeostasis and brain health, collectively maintaining QOL through
extended lifespan. Often, these aspects are tracked back to traditional home medicine,
oral wisdom and experiences that have not been validated enough by laboratory
studies. Only from last one decade, several laboratories worldwide have engaged
modern biotechnology tools to validate activities in herbal extracts and their active
components. One such herb is Ashwagandha, also called “Queen of Ayurveda” for
its popular use in Indian traditional home medicine. Multiple activities including
anticancer, antistress and remedial potential for old age-related neurodegenerative
pathologies, their active principles and underlying mechanism(s) have been investigated using cell culture and mice models. Here we provide a review on our findings
on the use of cell culture and molecular technologies as a valid approach to test
the effects of Ashwagandha extracts and bioactives, and their relevance to healthy
ageing.
###### **28.2 Use of Cell Culture Systems For Understanding** **Ageing, Stress and Disease Mechanisms**

Cell culture technologies that have established methods to grow human cells (as
attached to substratum or in suspended in culture medium) provide an extremely
useful experimental system to investigate the molecular mechanisms of life processes
including ageing, stress and a variety of diseases. Furthermore, they provide a convenient platform for pharmacological studies including drug screenings, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. Cell culture started with the hanging drop technique in
which a viable tissue was hung in growth favoring culture medium. It has progressed
to most complex techniques not only for cells from a wide variety of lineages but also
for cells in stressed, diseased and rejuvenated state including the induced pluripotent
and artificial cell systems (Lovitt et al. 2014; Yao and Asayama 2017; Kokubu et al.
2015; Kwakkenbos et al. 2016; Ostrow et al. 2015). The principles behind all of
these are, however, to count the cells, and inspect their morphology and functional
characteristics by molecular/biochemical/imaging assays. In a typical drug discovery
regimen, the response of living cells against the effect of a drug is tested in terms
of viability, morphology, growth patterns, nucleic acid rearrangements and modulation of the central dogma in target Vs control cells (Ghanemi 2015). Human normal
somatic cells have a limited life span and enter a state of permanent growth arrest after
dividing for a limited number of times, also known as the Hayflick limit (Hayflick
and Moorhead 1961). Cancer cells, on the other hand, often possess robust and infinite proliferation capability, and are established into immortal cell lines that offer
convenient material for research on its molecular mechanisms and drug discovery
(Wadhwa et al. 1991; Reddel 2000; Daniele et al. 2002; Kumar et al. 2021).

28 Why Ashwagandha for Healthy Ageing? … 591

Cellular senescence is an indispensable outcome of life processes such as, mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, cell division and telomere shortening, and
other intra- and extra-cellular stresses that constitute the normal byproduct of various
biological processes. DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions are essential part
of normal molecular signaling (Yang et al. 2020). Errors in these interactions lead to
malfunctions of proteins, hypo- or hyper-activation of signaling often lead to accumulation of aggregated, misfolded macromolecules and molecular garbage. Inefficiency
in clearance of misfolding and aggregated macromolecules due to decline in repair
and recycle signaling including DNA repair, protein degradation and autophagy often
connect to pathological conditions including premature ageing. In these premises,
natural/synthetic compounds that have the potential to prevent or revert stressinduced molecular changes and the pathogenesis are often refer to as anti-ageing
compounds. Cell based assays provide a convenient way to investigate the antistress and anti-ageing potential/efficacy of the test compounds. A large number of
compounds (~250) have been discovered by such cell-based assays (Bakula et al.
2019). On the other hand, cytotoxicity of the test compounds, time and dose dependent response assays are the established first steps of anticancer drug discovery
regimen. Furthermore, cell morphology, attachment and migration characteristics
often provide hints to their mechanism of action. We earlier developed Quantitative
and Qualitative Cell Viability assay (QCV assay) that provides an easy and reliable
method to identify short- and long-term response of cells to a variety of cytotoxic,
cytostatic and cytoprotective compounds (Garg et al. 2018a). Using high throughput
screening of several compounds, we had identified that a natural withanolide – Withanone, and Withanone-rich extract from Ashwagandha leaves, as well as caffeic
acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and CAPE-rich extract from honeybee propolis cause
toxicity to cancer cells selectively (Widodo et al. 2008, 2009, 2010, Priyandoko
et al. 2011, Grover et al. 2012, Wadhwa et al. 2016b, Bhargava et al. 2018). Using
cell-based loss of function screening assays, in which cells are treated with either
gene specific siRNA/shRNA or randomized ribozymes before exposing to the test
reagents, have revealed mechanism of action of these compounds, at least in part.
Stress-induced premature senescence in cultured cells is also commonly used
as a model system to test the stress activities of various environmental factors in
which the stressed phenotype is validated by monitoring the expression of stressinduced proteins and occurrence of structural and functional alterations. In order
to test the anti-ageing mechanisms, effects of the test compounds on replicative or
stress-induced senescence are determined by *in vitro* serial passaging. Molecular
mechanism(s) of action are determined by analysis of cell characteristics, changes in
the expression level of proteins and mRNAs that determine these characteristics. For
example, replicative and premature senescence can be determined by senescenceassociated β-galactosidase assay, increase in the expression level of H2AX, p53,
p21 [WAF1], p14 [ARF], p16 [INK4A] proteins that signify increased level of DNA damage
and induction of growth arrest by p53 and pRb tumor suppressor pathways (Kameda
et al. 2021; von Zglinicki et al. 2021; Zhang et al. 2021). Phosphorylation of HP1γ
on serine 93, required for incorporation of HP1γ into senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF), has been established as a specific marker for senescence.

592 R. Wadhwa et al.

We had earlier reported that mortalin, a member of Hsp70 family of proteins, is
frequently enriched in cancer cells and decreases with replicative senescence in
normal cells (Deocaris et al. 2013; Na et al. 2016). Cancer cells compromised for
mortalin entered senescence like growth arrest. (Deocaris et al. 2009; Gao et al.
2015; Yoo et al. 2010; Ryu et al. 2014; Wadhwa et al. 2000). In cancer cells, mortalin
sequesters the tumor suppressor p53 protein in the cytoplasm and thereby inactivates
it (Kaul et al. 2005; Wadhwa et al. 2006). Consistently, cells in which mortalin protein
has been compromised or its interactions with p53 is abrogated by natural/synthetic
compounds showed activation of p53 function and induction of either growth arrest
or apoptosis (Wadhwa et al. 2000; 2002a; 2002b; Widodo et al. 2008; Sari et al.
2020). Furthermore, subcellular distribution (staining pattern) of mortalin was seen
to shift from perinuclear (typical in cancer cells) to pancytoplasmic (typical in normal
cells). In line with these, the natural and synthetic compounds that caused senescence
in cancer cells also showed shift in mortalin staining pattern from perinuclear to
pancytoplasmic type (Wadhwa et al. 1993; Widodo et al. 2007).
Many cellular models of cancer have been introduced for molecular investigations
at the gene, transcript and protein levels. The mutated versions of tumor suppressor
proteins or their functional activation by various cellular factors including the binding
proteins have been identified and assigned to drive oncogenic signaling. Tumor
suppressor proteins, such as p53, pRB, p14 [ARF] and p1 [6INK4A] have emerged as key
regulators of senescence-related growth arrest (Duncan et al. 2000; Itahana et al.
2003; Larsen 2004). On the other hand, a large variety of cancers have been shown
to possess either mutated or inactivated forms of these proteins. It has been well established that mutations in p53 can activate many signaling pathways other than those
activated by the loss of wild type p53 activity (Fig. 28.1). Cancer cells possessing
specific p53 mutants have served as convenient models to understand their role in
carcinogenesis and metastasis (Shay et al. 1995; Duncan and Reddel 1997). Wild
type p53 acts as a transcription factor for a large number of proteins involved in
regulation of cell cycle progression, apoptosis and stress response. In turn, it is regulated by numerous proteins that regulate its subcellular localization, phosphorylation,
tetramerization that are essential factors for its activity as transcriptional factor. pRb,
known as the product of the retinoblastoma tumor susceptibility gene ( *RB1* ) is also a
major tumor suppressor protein. Cells containing mutated pRB possess chromosomal
instability and aneuploidy, contributing to tumorigenesis. Hypo-phosphorylated pRB
binds and inactivates E2F family of transcriptional factors and inhibit the progression of cell cycle. Phosphorylation of pRB by cyclin-CDK complexes leads to the
release of E2F from pRB-E2F complex (Fig. 28.1). The latter is an essential factor
for entry of cells to S-phase. In this way, cyclin-CDK complexes play a key role
in cell cycle proliferation or arrest (Roupakia et al. 2021). Activity of cyclin-CDK
complexes is inhibited by two classes of inhibitors, p21 [WAF1] (a major effector of p53)
and p16 [INK4A] . The latter is coded from INK4a (MTS1, CDKN2) locus that codes
for another unrelated tumor suppressor protein Alternative Reading Frame protein
(p14 [ARF] ) (Roupakia et al. 2021). It acts upstream of p53 and enhances its transcriptional activation function required for cell cycle arrest. Both p16 [INK4A] and p14 [ARF]

have been found to inactivated in cancers by gene silencing mediated by either point

mutations or DNA methylation. Cell culture models have played key role not only to
understand these mechanisms but also as drug discovery platforms (Larsen 2004).
Besides cancer, cell culture models are commonly used to understand the mechanisms of stress, ageing, age-related pathologies and their intervention (D’Souza
et al. 2021; Ali et al. 2021). Most of these are governed by altered repair capacity
and defense mechanisms leading to accumulative errors in replication and metabolic
processes. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a classic example of age-related pathologies
involving neuro-degeneration due to protein misfolding, accumulation of oxidatively
damagedproteins(accumulationofbeta-amyloidfibrilsandhyperphosphorylatedtau
proteins). These deposits are neurotoxic and have been found to be correlated with
cognitive impairment. Parkinson’s disease (PD), another age-related neurodegenerative disorder, involves the loss of dopaminergic neurons and causes symptoms like
tremors, bradykinesia and rigid muscles. Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)
is another old age disease, where the vision is impaired due to neovascular or atrophic
degradation of the macula of the retina in the eye. Cardiovascular diseases such as
atherosclerosis and myocardial infraction occur due to dyslipidemic states in the
body wherein the blood vessels accumulate cholesterol leading to plaque development and vascular remodeling, eventually leading to blocked arteries-veins and then
infraction of a portion of the heart. Stroke-ischemic, hemorrhagic and stroke that are
highly correlated with incidence of high blood pressure, show age-related trends.
Stroke patients usually loose a part of the brain function and thus wholly or partly
impairing the bodily function. Cell culture has played a major role so far to help
in deciphering the pathophysiology of these diseases and drug designing. Besides
the specific gene mutations and functions, contributions of oxidative stress, protein

###### **28.3 Cellular Stress as an Experimental Model** **to Determine Its Molecular Mechanisms** **and Modulation with Natural and Synthetic** **Compounds**

Cellular stress results in growth arrest, where a cell enters a cytostatic phase i.e., it
stops dividing but remains viable. This process hosts a complex change in the protein
homeostasis, whereby multiple proteins critically required for cell cycle progression
are involved. Normal cells are equipped with tumor suppression mechanisms that
essentially prevent the proliferation of defective or stressed cells. p53 and pRB constitute two main pillars of tumor suppressor machinery that regulate the cell proliferation in normal and stressed conditions. These in turn are regulated by multitude
of factors, intra and extra-cellular conditions. Inefficient tumor suppressor pathways
result in escape of cells from growth arrest and continue proliferation even in stressed
conditions leading to activation of carcinogenesis. On the other hand, reactivation of
tumor suppressor mechanisms in cancer cells put them into growth arrest/apoptosis
and are considered as a viable anti-cancer strategy (Amellem et al. 1996; Itahana
et al. 2002; Cheung et al. 2010; Mowla et al. 2014).
A variety of stress models are used in cell culture to evaluate the response of cells
to stress in terms of their growth characteristics, biochemical and molecular profiles.
Some of the commonly used stress reagents are listed in Table 28.1 (Kalra et al.
2020). It has been established that the stress-induced changes in expression level
of cell cycle regulating proteins put cells to arrest in a particular cell cycle phase.
This could be due to one or more simultaneously orchestrating processes viz., DNA
damage, activation of tumor suppressors, downregulation of proliferation pathways.
Each of these processes are characterized not only by specific proteins but also by
their threshold level that may be monitored by either biochemical or imaging assays.
Replicative senescence is associated with telomeric attrition and DNA damage stress
in an accumulative manner. These along with the decline in repair mechanisms yield
the final arrest of cells in nondividing, but viable, state that is marked by increase in
the level of p53, p21 [WAF1], p14 [ARF] and p16 [INK4A] proteins (Itahana et al. 2002; von
Zglinicki et al. 2021). At the same time, E2F, Cyclins and CDK family proteins that
are essential for cell cycle progression show decline. A variety of stresses have been
shown to mimic these changes and hence cause premature senescence in normal
human cells (Mohamad Kamal et al. 2020). Reversal of these changes and induction
of repair pathways are considered as anti-ageing effects. For example, mechanisms
that have been shown to play key role in preventing oxidative insults such as Nrf2dependent-pathway and antioxidant proteins are monitored to evaluate the anti-stress
and anti-ageing potential of natural/synthetic compounds (Yuan et al. 2021). Natural

compounds have largely been explored *in vitro* so as to elucidate their antioxidant,
anti-stress and hence anti-ageing properties. Various stressors have been studied with
respect to their protective activities on cells and key cell metabolic processes. Here,
we present the details of a few such common stresses with a summary of protective
activities by natural compounds.
In a conventional cell culture protocol, cells are subjected to oxidative stress by
H 2 O 2 or other chemical reagents and recovered in either the normal cell culture
medium or the one supplemented with test compounds. Using brain derived cells, it
has been established that the oxidative stress leads to upregulation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) and reduction in several key molecules involved in neurogeneration
and memory related functions (Wadhwa et al. 2016a). On the other hand, some
natural compounds including withanone, astaxanthin, fucoxanthin and resveratrol
were shown to protect against oxidative damage and promote neurodifferentiation
(Priyandoko et al. 2011, Kirtonia et al. 2020, Shah et al. 2015, Garg et al. 2018b,
Afzal et al. 2019; 2020). Molecular mechanisms of oxidative stress-induced damage
and protection by natural compounds can also be investigated using cell culture
system. UV radiation is another common stressor that produces ROS, oxidative
stress, and most importantly DNA damage leading to ageing, age-related pathologies and active oncogenesis. Cell culture system has been used to discover UVprotective compounds. For example, withanone (one of the withanolies from Ashwagandha) was shown to protect cells against UV-induced oxidative stress (Priyandoko et al. 2011). A combination of Withanone and Cucurbitacin B (a bioactive
compound present in the plants of Cucurbitaceae family) was shown to possess antistress capability (Garg et al. 2018b). Interestingly, several findings derived from cell
culture system has been proved in animal models. In mice model, UV radiationinduced wrinkles were corrected when treated with resveratrol by induction of antiinflammatory and antioxidant pathways (Arora et al. 2020). Fucoxanthin, a marine
carotenoid, has been shown to combat UV by downregulation of filaggrin against
sunburn, by regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in UVB exposed keratinocytes
*in vitro* (Matsui et al. 2016). Similarly, astaxanthin, another carotenoid pigment
present in marine organisms, has been shown to cause protective effects *in vitro*, in
neuronal cancers and against UV on ageing skin in clinical trials (Ng et al. 2021; Eren
et al. 2019). Many other chemical models representing the environmental stresses
including benzo[a]pyrene for smoke, sodium arsenite for heavy metal, 2-nitro-9fluorenone for diesel, bisphenol A bis(chloroformate) for plastics, cobalt chloride
for hypoxia, etc. have been studied using cell culture systems, and provide an easy
and affordable high throughput screening system to identify anti-stress compounds
(Kalra et al. 2020).

###### **28.4 Ashwagandha - Bioactivities Discovered in Cell** **Culture Models**

Scientifically known as *Withania somnifera*, Ashwagandha, Winter cherry or Indian
ginseng, belongs to Solanaceae family and readily grows in drier parts of India,
Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Congo and South Africa. It is characterized by erect
branching, a height of about 1.50 m, minutely stellate tomentose, fleshy, tapering and
whitish brown roots, ovate leaves and green flowers. The plant grows well between
600–1200 m altitude in sandy loam or light red soil with a pH of 7.5–8.0, and temperature range of 15 to 39 °C. The semi-tropical areas receiving 500–750 mm rainfall are
suitable for its cultivation, however, it requires a dry season during its growing period.
Widely prated and boasted in Ayurveda, Ashwagandha is known as the remedy of
all diseases. It has been used since the ancient times as a rejuvenizer, mood stabilizer, aphrodisiac, anti-diabetic, anticancer, antihypertensive, and immunomodulator.
Scientific studies in the past few decades have validated its anti-stress, anticancer,
anti-inflammatory, adaptogenic, cardiovascular, immunomodulatory and radiosensitizer activities. Ashwagandha is particularly rich in a group of phytochemicals
called withanolides. These are steroidal lactones and their derivatives (Wadhwa et al.
2016a). Several laboratory studies have reported anticancer activities in the extracts
derived from roots and leaves of Ashwagandha and the actives were identified as
Withaferin-A (Wi-A) and Withanone (Wi-N). **28.5 Anticancer Activity—Experimental Evidence**

We initially prepared the alcoholic extract from Ashwagandha leaves and called it
i-Extract. Bioactivity in i-Extract was examined by *in vitro* assays, using a variety of
human cancer cells. i-Extract caused toxicity to cancer cells; however it was nontoxic
to normal cells at the equivalent doses (Kaur et al. 2004; Widodo et al. 2007). Analysis of i-Extract by High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) showed that
it contained Wi-A and Wi-N as predominant constituents (Widodo et al. 2007).
Cell culture-based assays showed that the extracts with high ratio of Wi-N/Wi-A
exhibited selective toxicity to cancer cells. Molecular studies were undertaken on
the identified cellular targets for anticancer activities of i-Extract. We adopted lossof-function screening using shRNA and randomized ribozyme libraries. shRNAs
that caused resistance to the cytotoxic effect of i-Extract were selected and their
gene targets were anticipated to be crucial for i-Extract induced death in cancer
cells (Widodo et al. 2007, 2008). Interestingly, computational analysis of these gene
targets identified p53 tumor suppressor as one of the key elements of this effect. We
then examined the activities of p53 protein by biochemical and imaging analyses.
Interestingly, we found that the i-Extract and Wi-N caused activation of p53 tumor
suppressor pathway in cancer, but not normal, cells. Wi-A, on the other hand, was


-----

598 R. Wadhwa et al.

seen to activate p53 in both the cell types. It was consistent that Wi-A was cytotoxic to both cancer and normal cells, and confirmed that the activation of p53 is
one of the major mechanisms of anticancer activity in Ashwagandha bio-actives. It
has been previously reported that mortalin binds to p53 in cancer cells. The interaction of mortalin and p53 in cell cytoplasm was shown to cause retention of p53
in the cytoplasm and thus inhibiting its transcriptional activation function in the
nucleus (Wadhwa et al. 2016b, 2006; Yun et al. 2017). Ashwagandha bio-actives
were shown to inhibit mortalin-p53 interaction, causing retranslocation of p53 to the
nucleus and reactivation of its transcriptional activation function that results either
in growth arrest (allowing DNA repair) or apoptosis. Interestingly, i-Extract treated
cancer cells exhibited a shift in staining pattern of mortalin from perinuclear (typical
of cancer cells) to pancytoplasmic (typical of normal cells) pattern (Widodo et al.
2008; Grover et al. 2012; Kataria et al. 2012; 2013). In light of the reports that
mortain-p53 interaction occurs in cancer cells whereas normal cells lack this interaction, the above molecular data provided justification for the selective toxicity role
of i-Extract to cancer cells. Taken together, it was suggested that i-Extract blocked
mortalin-p53 interactions resulting in nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation of p53 (endorsed by increase in p21 [WAF1] and induction of senescence-like
growth arrest in cancer cells). Furthermore, i-Extract treated mutant p53 harbouring
cells showed decrease in (i) its expression level and (ii) expression of p21 [WAF1] indicative of wild type p53 activity. These data suggested that i-Extract reactivates tumor
suppressor function of p53 in cancer cells and could be utilised for cancer treatment
(Widodo et al. 2008). Multimode anticancer activity of i-Extract was confirmed by
selection of other proteins in loss-of-function screenings. These included (i) TPX2,
a microtubule-associated protein that regulates Aurora-A function in an allosteric
manner. Aurora-A is enriched in cancers and plays a key role in mitosis (centrosome
maturation and chromosome segregation in particular). Due to such essential role
of Aurora A in cell division, its inhibitors have been proposed as anticancer drugs.
Most of these inhibitors work by blocking its ATP binding site, common to other
kinases and hence limited by their specificity. Wi-A was shown to inhibit TPX2
and block TPX2-Aurora A complex. (ii) TFAP2A plays an important role in tumor
growth by regulation of several proteins including insulin like growth factor receptor1, MMP-2, E-cadherin, c-kit, Bcl-2, HER-2, and Smad signaling. (iii) ING1, an ING
family protein, involved in human cellular senescence, tumor suppression and apoptosis. (iv) LHX3, a homeodomain transcription factor that is involved in embryonic
development, cell fate determination, and oncogenesis. These data suggested that
the cancer cell killing by i-Extract might involve several proteins and multimodal
action. Analyses with computational and molecular docking tools further revealed
the involvement of several kinds of biological processes including cell cycle, nucleic
acid metabolism and cellular stress and oncogenesis at two levels (i) mitochondrial
stress that results in change in membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS)
(ii) DNA damage stress leading to activation of DNA damage and repair machinery.
It has been well established that whereas a moderate increase in ROS promotes cell
proliferation and differentiation, its excessive amount causes irreversible oxidative
damage to DNA, proteins and lipids leading to cell death (Widodo et al. 2007, 2008,

28 Why Ashwagandha for Healthy Ageing? … 599

2010). Cancer cells frequently exhibit high oxidative stress and increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as compared to the normal counterparts. The
higher level of ROS has been considered as a selective therapeutic target for cancer
treatment. Consistent with the cytotoxicity of Wi-A, Wi-N and i-Extract, induction of ROS was detected. Furthermore, i-Extract and Wi-N lead to an induction of
ROS only in cancer cells and hence was interpreted to be responsible for selective
cancer cell killing. Indeed, analysis of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP)
and ultrastructure revealed decrease in MMP and structure deterioration (swollen
and small fragmented mitochondria with reduced cristae) in i-Extract treated cancer
cells (Widodo et al. 2010).
Several independent studies have supported multimodal anticancer activity of WiA.Theseinclude(i)inactivationofNFκB,amultifunctionaltranscriptionalfactorthat
regulates cytokine production and stress response (Dubey et al. 2018), (ii) collapse
of intermediate filament protein Vimentin, an important regulator of cell shape and
migration (Thaiparambil et al. 2011; Ivaska et al. 2007), (iii) oxidative stress in endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria and mitc-FOS-FLIP-TRAIL induced apoptosis
(Nishikawa et al. 2015), (iv) inhibition of proteasome-mediated degradation leading
to upregulation of p21, BAX, IκBα and apoptotic cell death, (v) inhibition of STAT3
phosphorylation (an anti-apoptotic, pro-migratory factor in various types of cancers,
(vi) inhibition of Hedgehog signaling pathway, an important contributor to proliferation, differentiation, and maintenance of tissue patterning, (vii) inhibition of c-MET,
AKT and RAF-1 signaling, (viii) inhibition of snail and e-Cadherin mediating EMT
signaling (Hsu et al. 2019), (ix) downregulation of BRCA1 and HSF1 proteins and
(x) downregulation of HPV oncoproteins in human cervical cancer cells and restoration of p53 mediated growth arrest or apoptosis. Furthermore, Wi-A has been shown
to sensitize cancer cells to radiotherapy and work in a synergistic manner with other
standard clinical anticancer compounds including sorafenib (Cohen et al. 2012),
oxaliplatin (Li et al. 2015) and cisplatin (Kakar et al. 2012, 2014, 2016). It caused
inhibition of MRN complex and inhibition of telomere maintenance in ALT cancer
cells (Yu et al. 2017).
Withtheexperimentalstrategiesdescribedabove,effectofwaterextractofAshwagandha leaves (WEX) that contained low levels of Wi-N or Wi-A but moderate
amount of triethylene glycol (TEG) was investigated (Wadhwa et al. 2013). TEG
is a member of dihydroxy alcohol family, known to have high ability to hold water
molecules. It has been established as a low toxicity mild disinfectant towards a variety
of airborne, solution and surface bound microbes including bacteria and viruses. A
similar compound, triethylene tetramine (TETA) has been reported to be a novel
ligand for γ-quadruplex and possess many kinds of biological activities, including
telomerase inhibition and induction of senescence in tumor cells. Low dose of TETA

caused growth arrest of tumor cells in culture. Biochemical, molecular and imaging
analyses revealed that the cytotoxicity of TEG is mediated by activation of p53 and
pRb tumor suppressor pathways. However, in contrast to the selective activation of
p53 in response to i-Extract treatment as discussed above, WEX caused activation
of p53 both in cancer as well as normal cells. On the other hand, pRb phosphorylation and cyclin B1 decreased only in cancer cells. RB-phosphorylation causes

release of E2F from RB-E2F complex, and transcription of genes required for cell
cycle progression. Decrease in pRB phosphorylation in WEX-treated cancer cells
exhibited inhibition of E2F and cell cycle arrest. These cell-based studies provided
evidence that (i) ashwagandha possess multiple bioactives with multimodal mechanism of action and (ii) consumption of leaves as such may be more effective than
the partial alcohol or water extracts. In view of this, we investigated the anticancer
potential of Ashwagandha leaf powder and reported that mice fed with Ashwagandha (500 mg/Kg body weight) showed no toxicity, but strong suppression of
tumor progression. Furthermore, a mixture of leaf powder with gamma cyclodextrin
(γCD) showed higher efficacy, may be due to increased stability and bioavailability
of active ingredients (Wadhwa et al. 2013; Kaul et al. 2016).
Several studies have suggested that using combinations of bioactives could not
only have synergistic therapeutic efficacy but also offer side benefits such as healthy
ageing and lifespan extension of the healthy cells. Some of the examples are WiN+Wi-A (Gao et al. 2014), Cucurbitacin B+Wi-N (Garg et al. 2018b, 2020) and
CAPE+Wi-A (Sari et al. 2020). An analogue of Wi-A (2, 3-dihydro-3β-methoxy
Withaferin A) was shown to lack cytotoxic effect, instead showed senescence
inducing potential in a variety of cancer cells even at a relatively low-therapeutic
index dose (Chaudhary et al. 2017, 2019). It was shown to play a protective role in
healthy cells against various intracellular stresses. Whereas cucurbitacin was found
to be toxic to both cancer and healthy cells (Li et al. 2016), its combination with
withanone (Cu c Wi-N) was selectively toxic to cancer cells (Garg et al. 2020). At
differential doses, it also offered anti-metastatic, anti-stress, senescence-inducing
and differentiation-inducing potencies in cancer cells without causing any harm to
the healthy tissue. It offered health benefits in terms of protection to healthy cells
against harmful environmental toxins and even promoted healthy differentiation of
the brain cancer cells (Garg et al. 2018b). Some reports on investigations of bioactivities of Ashwagandha in animal models are listed here. In a rat model, 250–
750 mg/kg daily feeding of Ashwagandha root extract showed reduced incidence of
gentamycin-induced nephrotoxicity (Jeyanthi and Subramanian 2009). This feature
was characteristically attributed to the antioxidant potential in the Ashwagandha
root constituents. Additionally, Ashwagandha leaves, fresh and dry tubers showed
strong antioxidant activity in the DPPH and lipid peroxidation models (Sumathi et al.
2007), where the leaves showed the highest potential. Alcoholic root extract provided
protection against lead toxicity in a mouse model (Chaurasia et al. 2000).
In view of the above findings, hydroponic cultivation of Ashwagandha that could
offer stable and defined resource of its bioactive components was established. By
altering light and geography, hydroponically cultivated Ashwagandha leaves were
engineered to be enriched in Wi-A and Wi-N (Kaul et al. 2016). Of note, Wi-N
and Wi-A in leaves at the concentration of 3 and 1.8 mg/g in the usual setting
increased to about 8.6 and 3.4 mg/g upon such manipulations, respectively. Furthermore, it was shown that pre-soaking of seeds and cultivation of Ashwagandha plant
in Vermicompost, resulted in higher germination, denser leaf and root mass, and
higher concentrations of active withanolides per se (Kaur et al. 2018).

###### **28.6 Antistress Bioactives and their Bioactivities**

Ageing is governed by multiple genetics and environmental factors. Oxidized
proteins buildup with age as a normal byproduct of life-driving processes and
increasing errors and inefficiencies in repair and recycle processes. Oxidative damage
has been established as a major contributory factor to the age-related pathologies
such as, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease. Proteasome plays an important role in
degradation of damaged, mutant and misfolded proteins. Progressive failure in maintenance of protein quality and garbage management capacities by regular clearing
of the damaged proteins lead to an accumulation of misfolded/modified proteins.
Strengthening of proteasomal function has been predicted as an antiageing strategy
to manage the accumulation of garbage and provide rejuvenation. As signified by
its species name, *somnifera*, Ashwagandha contains high amounts of withanolides
and has sleep-inducing activity. It is often described as Aphrodite herb (after the
Greek goddess of beauty and sexual attractiveness) and believed to increase sexual
desire. Intake of Ashwagandha works in various ways to enrich the body’s physical and mental wellbeing, which likely connects to pleasurable sexual experiences.
Inability to enjoy sexual pleasure is associated with fatigue and nervous exhaustion;
Ashwagandha promotes calmness and restfulness, which may account for its aphrodisiac activity. Ashwagandha affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal hormonal
and signaling axis as well as the neuroendocrine system, which controls how our
bodies react to stress. Thus, Ashwagandha induces a state of harmony among various
physiological functions. The adaptogenic activities of Ashwagandha—its ability to
promote balance in the body and help deal with stress—are the outcome of combined
positive functions of several potent withanolides, alkaloids, and other compounds.
Pre-clinical research and clinical studies support therapeutic use of this plant to
improve cardiovascular function, liver function, and cognitive and memory-related
ailments (Wadhwa et al. 2016a; Gannon et al. 2019; Kulkarni and Dhir 2008; Modak
et al. 2007; Ven Murthy et al. 2010). ***28.6.1 Bioactive: Withanone***

In our efforts to characterize Ashwagandha activities and their molecular mechanisms, we initially prepared the leaf extract of Ashwagandha (i-Extract) that showed
anticancer activity as described in the above section. In contrast to up-regulation of
21 [WAF1] in cancer cells, it caused down-regulation in normal cells. Since p21 [WAF1] is
tightly involved in initiation and establishment of cellular senescence, we anticipated
that the Wi-N treated cells may have anti-ageing effect. In long term serial passaging
of normal human fibroblasts, indeed Wi-N treated cells underwent further 10–12
population doublings (Widodo et al. 2009). When examined at parallel population
doublings, Wi-N treated normal fibroblasts showed about 20% less auto-fluorescence
(accumulated molecular damage) and senescence-associated β-gal activity (marker

for senescence) supporting that Wi-N-induced increase in population doublings of
cells may be due to the delayed senescence in normal human fibroblasts (Widodo
et al. 2009). Increase in oxidative stress and decrease in proteasomal function and
accumulation of molecular garbage have been established as the main causes of
senescence-associated functional decline both in cellular and organismal models.
In our experiments, normal cells were exposed to either H 2 O 2 or UV for oxidative stress and followed by their recovery in either normal or Wi-N supplemented
medium (Widodo et al. 2009). Biochemical and imaging analyses supported that the
presence of Wi-N protected cells against UV as well as oxidative stress (Widodo
et al. 2009). Furthermore, premature ageing was induced by proteasomal inhibitor,
epoxomicin. The effect of Wi-N in this premature ageing model system revealed
protection against the premature ageing. Biochemical analysis revealed that Wi-N
has a strong proteasomal inducing activity in treated cells. Thus Wi-N was seen to be
not only selectively toxic to cancer cells, but also protect normal human fibroblasts
against the toxicity caused by Wi-A (Widodo et al. 2009).
###### ***28.6.2 Bioactive: 3β-Methoxy Withaferin A***

Anticancer activity of Wi-A was supported by induction of wild type p53 activities.
Interestingly, cells when treated with 3β-methoxy withaferin A (mWi-A) showed
neither cytotoxicity nor any effect on the p53 signaling (Chaudhary et al. 2017,
2019). NRF-2 is an important regulator of cellular oxidative stress response. It is
upregulated in many cancers and provides an advantage of survival against oxidative
stress. NRF-2 was identified as an important target of Wi-A. The level of NRF-2 was
examined in Wi-A and mWi-A treated cells. When cells were treated with Wi-A there

was a decrease in NRF2 expression, but no change was observed in mWi-A treated
cells. Similar phenomenon was observed with ROS induction in response to Wi-A
treatment. Increase in CARF and GADD45, DNA damage regulatory proteins, was
also recorded in Wi-A, but not in mWi-A treated cells. 3βmWi-A lacked cytotoxic
effect and was well tolerated at higher concentrations (Chaudhary et al. 2017). Rather
it protected normal cells against oxidative, chemical and UV stress by activating
anti-stress and pro-survival signaling.
Wi-A, and 3βmWi-A are natural co-occurring withanolides in Ashwagandha
leaves. 3βmWi-A, with the substitution of a β-methoxy group at Wi-A parental ring is
suggestedtobeanaturalWi-Aanalogue.Wi-Aispotentanticancercompound,shown
to inhibit cancer cell proliferation, metastases and EMT processes, 3βmWi-A lacked
these activities. Consistently, Wi-A, but not 3βmWi-A, led to vimentin aggregation.
Wi-A, but not 3βmWi-A, treated cells showed decrease in Vimentin, N-cadherin and
E-cadherin proteins, signifying compromised cell migration and invasion. Wi-A was
earlier shown to target hnRNP-K, a key regulator of cell migration and angiogenesis.
Reduced levels of MMPs, uPA proteases and VEGF targets viz *.* phospho-p38MAPK,
heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) that promote cancer cell migration were indeed found

3βmWi-A (i) was found to be safe and possess stress-relieving activity (ii) when
given subsequent to a variety of stress factors including Wi-A, protects normal cells
against their toxicity, and (iii) is a vital compound that may guard normal cells against
the toxicity associated with various targeted therapeutic regimes in clinical practice.
Normal cells exposed to oxidative, UV and genotoxic (doxorubicin, cisplatin and
etoposide) drug induced stress, when subsequently recovered in 3βmWi-A supplemented culture medium showed better survival (Chaudhary et al. 2019). Furthermore,
an increase in 3βmWi-A induced recovery was found to be concentration and time
dependent, supporting the pro-survival effect of 3βmWi-A. The data was confirmed
by expression analysis of stress marker proteins that provided molecular evidence to
the differential regulation of apoptosis and survival pathways by Wi-A and 3βmWi-A,
respectively. Of note, 3βmWi-A protected normal cells against Wi-A cytotoxicity to
some extent and provided molecular evidence to the long-trusted belief in Ayurveda’s
holistic approach of herbal extracts over the purified components.
###### ***28.6.3 Bioactive: Triethylene Glycol***

Triethylene glycol (TEG) was detected in the water extract of Ashwagandha leaves
by NMR analysis. It inhibited cancer cell proliferation by activation of pRB tumor
suppressor pathway. TEG is primarily used for industrial purpose and very little is
known about its use in the biological systems. TEG has been found to have little or
no toxicity in various animal studies suggesting that it is relatively safe in biological
system. In Indian system of traditional home medicine, Ayurveda, the root or whole
plant extract of Ashwagandha ( *Withania somnifera* ) has been used to assist in sleep.
In search of sleep-inducing active components in Ashwagandha, we investigated the
effect of various components on sleep regulation by oral administration in mice. We
found that the alcoholic extract that contained high amount of active withanolides
was ineffective to induce sleep in mice. However, the water extract which contains
TEG as a major component induced significant amount of non-rapid eye movement
(NREM) sleep with slight change in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (Kaushik
et al. 2017). Commercially available TEG also increased NREM sleep in mice in
a dose-dependent manner. The study had demonstrated that the TEG is an active
sleep-inducing component in Ashwagandha leaves and could potentially be useful
for insomnia therapy, a common age-related disorder. ***28.6.4 Bioactivity: Anti-neurodegenerative***

recycling. In cell culture-based studies, brain-derived cells when treated with Ashwagandha extract showed protections against oxidative stresses and even showed differentiation to their functional states. For example, these treated cells were protected
against H 2 O 2 -mediated ROS production and DNA damage. They showed upregulation of GFAP (a marker for glial-differentiation), and NF200 and MAP2 (markers
for neuro-differentiation). The low dose cocktail of withanone with cucurbitacin B
( CucWi-N) also showed similar effects with an upregulation of GAP43, MAP2 and
GFAP proteins (Shah et al. 2009, 2015; Kataria et al. 2011, 2012, 2013).
Scopolamine is a potent acetylcholine receptor antagonist that inhibits central
cholinergic neuronal activity and impairs memory as evident by several behavioral parameters like water maze and passive avoidance latency test. Scopolamineinduced amnesic mouse model is one of the well-recognized pharmacological animal
models of memory dysfunction. Ashwagandha leaf extract protected the glioma
and neuroblastoma cells against scopolamine-induced stress. In mice model, scopolamine supplementation led to dose- and time-dependent suppression of brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and GFAP genes in brain tissue, the effect was
suppressed by co-supplementation of the Ashwagandha extract or Wi-N. Biochemical analysis showed that Wi-N caused suppression of ROS and upregulation of
MAP2, NF200, PSD-95 and GAP43 proteins advocating for its neuro-protective
and differentiation-inducing potential. We also identified the muscarinic receptors
(acetylcholine-responding post-synaptic responders) to be some of the targets of WiN. Whereas scopolamine drastically reduced actin polymerization and Arc (Activityregulated cytoskeletal associated protein that plays a key role in synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation), Ashwagandha extract and Withanone treated mice
showed increase in ARC expression and dendrite spine density (Konar et al. 2011,
2019, 2020; Gautam et al. 2013).
Traumatic events (ischemia, injury and epilepsy) and neurodegeneration (Huntington’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s diseases) which often show
age-related trend involve glutamate toxicity and severe neurological deficits. Ashwagandha water extract was shown to promote repair and regenerative mechanisms in
glutamate (excitatory neurotransmitter acting on the NMDA and AMPA receptors)induced toxicity in retinoic acid-differentiated brain cancer cells. Using the brain
derived cell culture systems, it was shown that Ashwagandha extract not only
attenuated glutamate excitotoxicity, but also showed the potential to improve the
neural plasticity, learning and memory functions. Neurodegenerative and cognitive disorders as well as loss of memory impair daily aspects of personal, work
and social that increases with age. Ashwagandha has been recommended as a
potential treatment option for these ailments due to its well- recognized antistress, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, cortisol lowering, procholinergic, anti-glutamatergic and neuroprotective properties. Steroidal lactones
such as glycowithanolides, sitoindosides, and Withaferin A, have been validated
as potent brain antioxidant, neuroprotective and memory enhancing factors in cell
and animal studies. In animal models of stress (stress measuring assays including
swimming, sleep deprivation as well as chemical and physical stresses), pretreatment with Ashwagandha extract normalized the levels of antioxidative enzymes and

caused reduction in lipid peroxidation products like malonidialdehyde and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. Chronic administration of Ashwagandha enhanced
memory in Morris Maze Test and in immobilization stress rat models.
As also stated above, Ashwagandha is the most recognized nootropic or natural
memory and cognitive enhancer-herb in Indian traditional home medicine system. It
isrecommendedtorecovermemorydeclineinageingandneurodegenerativepathologies as well as enhance basal memory function of healthy individuals. The data
has been experimentally supported by its effects such as (i) activation of antioxidant defense system, (ii) induction of cholinergic system, (iii) up-regulation of
neural plasticity, and (iv) regeneration of damaged neurons and synapses. Stressed
cells have been shown to possess significant disruption of neural network involving
both dendrite and axonal atrophy and premature neurodegeneration. Ashwagandha
extract and its bioactives including Withanolide A, Withanoside IV, and Withanoside
VI have been shown to stimulate dendrite and axonal growth and reconstructed
damaged synapses in stressed neuroblastoma cell lines (Wadhwa et al. 2016a). Oxidative stress contributes to majority of brain dysfunctions including memory impairment. It has been tightly connected to ageing and neurodegenerative diseases such
as Parkinson’s, Alzheimer and Huntington’s. Rotenone is a neurotoxic compound
that mimics Parkinson’s associated memory and cognitive impairment. Ashwagandha leaf extract was shown to normalize the level of oxidative stress markers
and restores GSH level. Amongst physiological models, hypoxia- the lack of oxygen
supply has been shown to cause oxidative stress, degenerate neural cells and affect
memory function. Ashwagandha extracts with strong antioxidant potential has been
shown to successfully ameliorating stress and restoring memory. In an experimental
animal model of epilepsy, Ashwagandha extract and withanolide-A were shown to
be neuro-protective and recover spatial memory loss by reduction in oxidative stress
(Manjunath and Muralidhara 2013, 2015).
In order to support the use of Ashwagandha extracts for medicinal use relating
directly or indirectly to healthy ageing, a number of clinical studies have been
reported. Consumption of Ashwagandha extract appear to reduce chronic stress,
anxiety and insomnia and improve memory and cognition in a dose-dependent
manner (Raut et al. 2012; Choudhary et al. 2017). At just 120 mg/day dose, it
reduced the severity of obsessive–compulsive disorder (Jahanbakhsh et al. 2016).
At 400 mg/day dose, it significantly decreased the fasting blood glucose and serum
triglycerides(Agnihotrietal. 2013).Similareffectswerealsoseenat500mg/daydose
(Pingali et al. 2014). Ziegenfuss et al. (2018) showed that the use of 500 mg/day dose
may enhance the physical strength and performance. Against subclinical hypothyroidism, 600 mg/day Ashwagandha root extract effectively normalized the serum
thyroid indices (Sharma et al. 2018). At 675 mg/day dose, the extract significantly
reduced the severity of male infertility, and increase the sperm count, semen volume,
and sperm motility (Ambiye et al. 2013). Similarly, the dose of 1000 mg/day given
to Schizophrenia patients, a medium effect on depression and anxiety in cases of
schizophrenia were observed (Gannon et al. 2019).

###### ***28.6.5 Anti-diabetic***

Diabetes, characterized by hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, is one of the major
health problems in the twenty-first century. One or more symptoms of diabetes
(glycosuria, dysbiosis, polyphagia, polyuria, polydipsia, sleep issues, weakness and
tiredness) appear at mid age and often show age-related worsening trend. Main treatments of diabetes include the use of metformin (example of Biguanides) and recombinant insulin which are regarded as safe, well-tolerated and highly effective. Other
classes of drugs include Sulfonylureas—glimepiride, glipizide, glyburide, Thiazolidinediones—pioglitazone, Actos generic, Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors—Acarbose, and Meglitinides—naateglinide. Combinatorial therapy is usually employed to
ensure insulin spikes in the patient. Although, the use of Western medicine is highly
affective but turns out to be expensive and adverse effect laden, herbal medication is
hence being researched upon as alternatives.
Ashwagandha withanolides have been shown to possess anti-hyperglycemic
activity in several experimental models. Studies have suggested that low oral doses
of Ashwagandha cause anti-hyperglycemic action which is due to their ability to
stimulate insulin release from pancreatic cells, glucose transporters and inhibition
of enzymatic activities of α-amylase and α-glucosidase involved in starch degradation and digestive process. Furthermore, Wi-A and Wi-N have been shown to
modulate the functions of cellular chaperones responsible for tissue repair and other
nuclear processes regulating oxidative stress and cellular stress responses. A clinical
study indicated that the regular intake of low dose of Ashwagandha root powder
could induce potassium sparing diuretic effects in diabetic patients and also reduce
serum cholesterol and triglycerides in hyperlipidemic patients. Report of another
30-day exploratory clinical study observed an improvement in sleep quality of the
patients. Significant improvements of endothelial function, as well as in biomarkers
of oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and HbA1C levels were also observed.
Animal studies on anti-hyperlipidemic and other beneficial effects of Ashwagandha
withanolides against altered lipid metabolism in diabetic or hyperlipidemic animals
have revealed increase in bile acid synthesis, reduction in HMG-CoA activity and
improvements in antioxidative status of the animals. Furthermore, psychiatric conditions that often accompany or caused by metabolic disorders like diabetes have been
shown to be benefited by Ashwagandha (Udayakumar et al. 2009; Parihar et al. 2016;
Kaur and Kaur 2017; Saleem et al. 2020, Durg et al. 2020).
Most recently, in scenario of global COVID-19 pandemic by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-coronavirus 2; SARS-CoV-2) that emerged
in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, all aspects of normal life are affected. High
infected numbers and deaths world-wide have evoked urgent initiation of new line of
drug and vaccine development on one-hand and repurposing of the existing drugs on
theother.Becauseoftheimmunityenhancingpropertiesofseveralkindsoftraditional
home medicine, they have been recommended for the prevention and treatment of
COVID-19. Ashwagandha bio-actives, Wi- and Wi-N, were explored for their potential for antiCOVID-19 activity using bioinformatics and experimental technologies.

These were tested for their binding to a highly conserved protein (M [pro], an essential
protein for virus replication and survival) of SARS-CoV-2. It was found that WiN, but not Wi-A, binds strongly to M [pro] with the binding energy equivalent to its
known inhibitor (N3) predicting that Wi-N may serve as a natural drug for COVID19. Binding potential of Wi-A and Wi-N to cell membrane protein (TPMRSS2) that
acts as a gate for entry of virus to the host cell was also investigated. Both Wi-A
and Wi-N have been predicted to bind stably with TMPRSS2; Wi-N showed stronger
interactions. Furthermore, human cells treated with Wi-N showed low level of expression of TMPRSS2 predicting three-way action of Wi-N to deal with SARS-CoV-2
(blocking its entry to the host cells by interaction with TMPRSS2, downregulation of
TMPRSS2 expression and diminishing the viral survival through inhibition of viral
M [pro] protein) (Kumar et al. 2020a, b). Taken together, cell culture-based studies have
provided evidence that whereas Wi-A has strong anticancer potential, Wi-N offers
antistress, neurogenerative and antivirus activities that may contribute to healthy
ageing. Therefore, purposeful consumption of Ashwagandha warrants attention to
the amount and ratio of active withanolides that have been shown to vary in different
parts of the plant (Kumar et al. 2020a).

###### **28.7 Conclusion**

Ageing is an extremely complex, unavoidable byproduct of life processes. Defined
as a time-related normal process, it is complicated by a variety of tissue dysfunctions resulting in pathological conditions. Intrinsic and extrinsic stresses impact the
ageing process by several ways, often leading to premature ageing. Recent laboratory
studies have demonstrated the strength of cell culture and molecular technologies
to investigate the mechanisms of these processes and their manipulation by natural
and synthetic compounds. Ashwagandha-derived withanolides have been shown to
possess a variety of bioactivites including anticancer (at high doses) and anti-stress (at
low doses) in cell culture (Fig. 28.2) as well as mouse models (Fig. 28.3) accounting
for its value for disease therapeutics on one hand and healthy ageing on the other,
respectively.

##### **Chapter 29**
#### **The Fact and Fiction of Nutritional** **Claims About Health and Longevity**

**Éric Le Bourg**

**Abstract** For centuries, various feeding regimens have been proposed to live longer
with a better health. However, in many cases, they have not been proven to have any
positive effect, and they can even have negative ones. This chapter reviews the claims
of various regimens (e.g. detox diets, fasting). It is doubtful that they could increase
human lifespan and improve health, provided one adopts a balanced regime with no
excessive intake and avoids junk food.
##### Keywords Claims · Fact · Fiction · Food restriction · Anti-aging · Healthspan
###### **29.1 Introduction**

For centuries, various regimes have been proposed to live longer and provide a better
health(seethechapter25inthisbook:Stambler 2020a;Haber 2004;Stambler 2020b).
Modulating food intake appears as an obvious strategy to improve health because
everybody has observed that gluttony or famine bring with them a bad health. Going
a step farther, it could be expected that modulating both the quantity and quality of
food has beneficial or deleterious effects on healthspan and, ultimately, on lifespan.
One of the first modern claims that a specific food could have such effects was that
of the 1908 Nobel laureate Elie Metchnikoff, who wrote (translated from French)
that “the introduction of microbes cultivated from sour milk can bring about a considerable change in the intestinal flora in a direction favourable to the preservation of
health … (and) making old age more physiological than it is at present and probably
also of prolonging human lifespan” (Metchnikoff 1903). This was the beginning of
the yoghurt industry (Fisberg and Machado 2015) and the good news is that eating
yoghurt does not provoke any harm. This is however not the case with all regimens
claiming to increase lifespan. One of the issues with such regimens is that fear of
aging can lead many people to support them despite any counter-argument. Because
this behaviour is not only that of adepts but can also be that of scientists, the net result É. Le Bourg ( B )

is that some people are even more convinced that they adopt the best way to live long
if they eat a specific food, ingest antioxidants, or fast. Partly connected to this issue
is that of fashion. From time to time, a new long-life recipe shoots to the fame and
many people are immediately convinced of it, before giving up when a new recipe
is proposed on the TV, magazines or social networks. This is an issue because, in
some cases, these recipes are dangerous and it has been warned that “some dietary
supplements have been associated with potentially serious health consequences for
senior citizens” (United States General Accounting Office 2001).
Therefore, fear of ageing, fashion, or over-enthusiasm of the lay public and scientists are obstacles to know the merits and pitfalls of regimens and/or individual
nutritional components claiming to improve life at old age, or even to live longer,
and this should be taken into account when reviewing the effects of these regimens.
The purpose of this chapter is to separate the fact and fiction of nutritional claims
about health and longevity.
###### **29.2 Vitamins and Other Micro-nutrients**

Vitamins are often considered by the lay public to be “good” because of their name,
vitamin meaning life and amine, and of their association with fruits and vegetables.
Most of people know that a lack of vitamins can provoke severe health issues and
some think that the higher the dose, the best is the effect on health. While the first
part of this sentence is correct, the second one is not. However, relying on this wrong
rationale, many people, including some scientists, believe that one should supplement
food with vitamins, even if it already contains a large part of fruits and vegetables.
The first issue is that high doses of some vitamins can be toxic, as it is the case
with vitamin E (Miller et al. 2005; Bjelakovic et al. 2007). The second issue, less
tragic, is that high doses can be not assimilated and are excreted, like vitamin C in
urine. Nevertheless, the double Nobel laureate Linus Pauling promoted high doses
of vitamin C because “vitamin C will have great value in controlling the problems
associated with advancing age” (Pauling 1983) and also “improve the general health
of nearly every cancer patient (and) increase survival time somewhat” (Pauling and
Moertel 1986). Regarding this claim of Pauling on cancer, Moertel, in the same
two-handed article, severely wrote: “Whether one is dealing with treatment of the
common cold or of cancer, and whether one is dealing with a benign vitamin or a
highly toxic chemotherapeutic drug, it would seem to best serve the interest of the
patient if public advocacy of a proposed treatment is withheld until that treatment
has been proved effective by definitive studies of sound scientific design”.
In any case, the opinion of a Nobel laureate can lead to major consumption changes
and the main result is that, nowadays, the internet is replete with sites promoting
vitamin C. The Nobel laureate Elie Metchnikoff provoked the birth of a new industry,
that of yoghurt, and the Nobel laureate Linus Pauling made that many people take
1 g or more of vitamin C daily and produce an expensive urine, for the best of


-----

29 The Fact and Fiction of Nutritional Claims … 619

pharmaceutical industry. The difference is that yoghurt is a food, and thus useful,
and that taking 1 g of vitamin C daily is useless, particularly if people eat fruits.
Beside vitamins, other micro-nutrients, such as mineral ones, are advertised and
sold as recipes to live longer. For instance, selenium (Se), which is involved in antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase, is sold on the internet for “optimized
health and longevity support”. However, while selenium deficiency can be an issue,
for instance in Sweden (Alehagen et al. 2016), and “may suggest the value of modest
Se supplementation in order to improve the health of the Swedish population”, it is
not the case in the USA, a result which pleas against supplementation because the
window for therapeutic effects is narrow and toxic effects are soon observed (references in Bleys et al. 2007). Yet, dozens of selenium supplements are for sale in the
USA.
###### **29.3 Antioxidants**

The free radical theory of ageing (Harman 1956) posits that ageing “seems to be
a more or less direct function of the metabolic rate”, as it was postulated by Pearl
(1928) in his rate of living theory, and that, because “the concentration of free radicals
increased with increasing metabolic activity”, antioxidants could “slow down the
aging process and thereby put off the appearance of the diseases associated with it”.
This theory gained early a very large popularity because it was easy to understand: a
higher metabolism means more radicals, more attacks, and thus a shorter life. In fact,
Harman(1956)providedthebiochemicalmechanismofthepostulatednegativeeffect
of metabolism on lifespan. However, it seems clear for many years, among species
(e.g. Austad and Fischer 1991) or in the same species (e.g. Lints 1989), that a higher
metabolism is not linked to a lower lifespan. Furthermore, the free radicals theory of
ageing does not seem to explain lifespan. For instance, among 13 primate species,
Csiszar et al. (2012) concluded that “increased longevity in this sample of primates
is not causally associated with low cellular reactive oxygen species generation”.
Within species, Le Bourg’s reviews (2001,2003,2005) concluded that it is doubtful
that antioxidants could be of help to increase lifespan in animal models or in human
beings.
Finally, Speakman and Selman (2011) wrote that there are “fundamental questions
over whether the free-radical damage theory remains useful for understanding the
ageing process”. These authors emphasised that “it has been recently suggested that
perhaps the lifespan effect is too harsh a criterion by which the theory should be
evaluated”, but one can bet that if clear effects of antioxidants had been observed
on lifespan, it would not be considered “too harsh a criterion”. The authors argued
that focusing on health is more sound because oxidative stress is linked with various
diseases. For instance, cataract is linked with a depletion of glutathione but, for
the time being, “antioxidant supplementation has been shown to be ineffective in
preventing or delaying cataract” (Lim et al. 2020). Beyond cataract, Luo et al. (2020)
put the last nail in the coffin, concluding that “while observational studies mainly


-----

620 É. Le Bourg

found detrimental effects of high oxidative stress levels on disease status, randomized
clinical trials examining the effect of antioxidant supplementation on disease status
generally showed null effects”.
In such conditions, why taking antioxidants to delay ageing and increase lifespan?
There is simply no reason to do that because, after decades of research, supplementing
food with antioxidants has not been shown to have any effect. Yet, it remains that
there is a plethora of antioxidants on the internet, for the best of companies selling
them.
###### **29.4 Other Dietary Supplements**

Companies have an innumerable imagination when they intend to sell dietary supplements, as it can be easily seen on the internet when typing “dietary supplements
aging” and selecting “shopping”. In addition to vitamins and antioxidants, many
other supplements are for sale, and it would be a waste of time to enumerate all of
them. Just focus on a famous one, because advertised, again, by a Nobel laureate.
Fermented papaya was promoted by the 2008 Nobel laureate Luc Montagnier
as having anti-ageing effects and boosting antioxidant defences. It was particularly
proposed in 2002 to the pope John Paul-2 as a remedy against the Parkinson’s disease.
In 2004, the French food safety agency concluded that there was not any evidence
for an anti-ageing effect and that (translated from French) “the use of recommendations by scientific personalities, which is decried in the context of the promotion
of pharmaceutical products, is not acceptable for foodstuffs either” (AFSSA 2004).
Since then, a few articles have been published, not always in well-known journals,
and it seems that fermented papaya has not shown a significant amount of positive
effects on the ageing process, which could induce its use as a classical drug.
This is probably the final word about dietary supplements: if some scientists think
that the supplement X can be of use to improve or delay ageing or increase lifespan, it
is incumbent upon them to work with pharmaceutical companies to test their expected
new anti-ageing drug according to the usual rules. If X eventually appears to be of
some use, more than a placebo, it will be incorporated in the list of authorised and
prescribed drugs. If it is not the case, X will be one of the numerous disappointing
hopes, a common fate when testing new drugs. By contrast, promoting X in the
mass-media without sticking to this process is an abuse of the public credibility. **29.5 Specific Regimens (Mediterranean, Unbalanced,** **and Okinawa Diets)**

Beyond the various supplements, several diets have been proposed to live long with a
goodhealth.ThemostfamousoneisprobablytheMediterraneandietwithmanyfruits

29 The Fact and Fiction of Nutritional Claims … 621

and vegetables rather than excessive meat and fats. This diet seems to favour a better
healthspan (e.g. Féart et al. 2010) and reduce all-cause mortality (e.g. Eleftheriou
et al. 2018). It is not clear whether individual components of the Mediterranean diet
explain its positive effects, as each component may have a slight positive effect, if
any (Eleftheriou et al. 2018). However, it seems clear that people eating fruits and
vegetables are less prone to eat junk food and thus eating more fruits is also eating less
junk food. This way, adopting widely the Mediterranean diet could reduce the global
threat of obesity and cardio-vascular diseases (GBD 2017). It is not so surprising
that this diet has positive effects on health or, rather, not-deleterious effects. Indeed,
eating fruits and vegetables, proteins coming from fish and other animals, is not
really different from the diet of the human kind for millennia. It is highly different
from the consumption of excessive sugar, soft drinks, junk food and other modern
foodstuffs not conceived to provide appropriate calories and a balanced regimen with
lipids, proteins and carbohydrates, but to be massively sold with the lowest possible
price and the highest profit. This Mediterranean diet thus appears to be a traditional
feeding regimen but it should not be confused with the so-called paleolithic diet,
whichpromotes34%ofcaloriescomingfromproteins(EatonandKonner 1985).This
paleolithic diet does not seem to be linked with beneficial effects on health (Dinu et al.
2020), which is maybe not surprising because a 35% level of proteins is dangerous
as it exceeds the capacity of the liver to convert nitrogen in urea (Bilsborough and
Mann 2006).
Beside the non-balanced paleolithic diet, other regimens have been proposed
with either a low or high level of proteins, carbohydrates or lipids. Using a nonbalanced regimen appears to be an error from the beginning, as it artificially alters
the spontaneous feeding choice, because subjects forced to ingest an unbalanced diet
could tend to reestablish their nutritional target as soon as possible. For instance,
Simpson et al. (2003) showed that people fed for two days with a diet containing
much more than the usual 15% of calories coming from proteins decrease their
food intake by nearly 50%, with the result that the total consumption of proteins is
hardly modified. Conversely, subjects forced to eat less proteins for two days increase
their food intake by nearly 35%, the total consumption of proteins being also hardly
modified. Thus, subjects eat less in the first case and more in the second one, because
they strictly regulate the intake of proteins rather than the number of calories. Could
it be that one of the causes of the epidemic of obesity in the USA is the decrease of
the protein content, from 17% of calories in 1971–1975 in the US diet to a nadir of
15.1% in 2001–2002 (Ford and Dietz 2013), and the necessity of an increased food
intake to eat enough proteins?
Similarly, it has been claimed that the Okinawa diet could improve health and
increase lifespan (Willcox et al. 2006). The feeding regimen observed after World
War 2 and up to the 1960s was depleted in proteins (9% of calories), which makes
that, combined with a low number of calories (1785 kcal/day), Okinawans ate ca
57% of the proteins eaten by other Japanese people (Le Bourg 2012). This covers
respectively, only 55, 70 and 84% of the daily protein needs of pregnant women,
adult men and women (Committee on dietary references intakes 2005). In 1950, ca
20% of Okinawans had therefore nutritional deficiency symptoms, such as a delayed


-----

menarche for 10% of women and a deficient lactation for 18% of them (Willcox
et al. 2007). Regarding lifespan, Okinawans outlived other Japanese people when
the infant mortality was twice higher in mainland Japan (e.g. 90‰ in 1940) than
in Okinawa (45‰), which obviously decreased mean lifespan on mainland, but this
higher lifespan in Okinawa does not longer exist today (Le Bourg 2012). Today, the
malnutrition linked to World War 2 is over, and there is no doubt that the traditional
Okinawan diet, with vegetables, sweet potatoes, and soy (Willcox et al. 2006), is of
a better quality than the modern occidental food with soft drinks, junk food and so
on. Yet, it seems there are no results showing that the Okinawan diet can increase
lifespan (Le Bourg 2012), as claimed by some authors (e.g. Willcox et al. 2006).
###### **29.6 Dietary Restriction**

Restricting the food intake is called dietary restriction (DR), but also calorie restriction or food restriction. Whatever the term, it means a decrease of food intake without
malnutrition. It has been claimed that DR “will extend the life of all species in the
Animalia kingdom, including the human species” (Masoro 2006) and that “it would
be surprising if appropriately applied, chronic DR would not significantly increase
the average lifespan of people” (Weindruch 2006). These very optimistic claims are
however maybe not warranted because, even if it is often claimed that DR increases
lifespan in many species, if not all, it is not the case (Le Bourg 2010), and, among
mice, the results are dependent on the genetic background (Liao et al. 2010). In nonhuman primates, it has been reported that DR increased lifespan in the mouse lemur
*Microcebus murinus* (Pifferi et al. 2018) and one of the two studies in the macaque
*Macaca mulatta* also reported a higher lifespan in food-restricted animals (Colman
et al. 2014; Mattison et al. 2012). However, these results are better explained by a
low lifespan in the control group because of a bad diet and/or overfeeding (Le Bourg
2018).
Regarding humans, results on people self-practicing DR or in controlled studies,
such as CALERIE (e.g. Ravussin et al. 2015) show that DR can decrease weight,
body-mass index, body fat, cholesterol level, triglycerides, blood pressure, fasting
glucose and insulin level (Fontana et al. 2004). All these indices are predictive of

−
a better cardio-vascular health. However, body temperature ( 0.2 °C, Heilbronn
et al. 2006), lean mass (−5%, Racette et al. 2006), muscular strength (−7%, Weiss
et al. 2007), mineral bone density, particularly on hip (Villareal et al. 2006), can also
decrease. A more recent study concluded that while DR decreased absolute muscle
strength, it increased the strength when expressed relative to body weight (Racette
et al. 2017), which could suggest that DR had no real negative effect. However, one
can oppose that a DR subject would have more difficulty to carry a 20 kg concrete
block than before beginning DR, and that having a higher strength when expressed
on the body weight would be of no help to carry the load.
It is not to say that DR protocols are useless as they could provide clues to fight
obesity but it is not sure that DR could improve health of people of a normal weight,


-----

29 The Fact and Fiction of Nutritional Claims … 623

with an appropriate diet and making some exercise, thus, to people already applying
well-known recipes to avoid a premature death. Furthermore, “people with a low
body-mass index (BMI, say below 21 kg/m [2] ) should also be cautioned against practicing CR, as they could soon become underweight, which is a risk factor for various
health concerns” (Le Bourg and Redman 2018). It could even be said that DR could
be risky for lean people, as adverse events linked to DR (infections, gastrointestinal
disorders, and so on) are more probable in subjects with a normal body mass index
(BMI: 22–25 kg/m [2] ) than in overweight ones (BMI: 25–28 kg/m [2] ) (Romashkan et al.
2016; Le Bourg 2018). Le Bourg and Redman (2018) have warned that DR “with
the aim of delaying aging and increasing longevity is not an approved treatment for
self-administration”, and particularly that “the risk for elderly people is often not to
eating too much, but eating too little”, because there is a severe risk of undernutrition
in elderly people (Kagansky et al. 2005).
However, other authors do not hesitate to write that people should consume starch
and fat blockers in addition to a moderate DR (Kurzweill and Grossman 2010),
despite the fact that starch and fat blockers are drugs with side-effects. They are
prescribedagainstdiabetesandobesityandcertainlynotintheabsenceofanydisease,
even if the internet is replete with advertisements for these products. Similarly, other
authors claim that DR could be useful to people, like Most et al. (2017) who write
that a forced 20% DR without malnutrition during World War 2 in Norway made that
mortality from cardio-vascular diseases dropped by 30%. Because the cited study
of Strøm and Jensen (1951) reports a very “close correlation” with the up to 40%
decrease of fat intake, it could be concluded that DR decreased mortality but tobacco
consumption also decreased by ca 50% during the war (Lund et al. 2009). It is not a
risky hypothesis to state that this decreased consumption of tobacco had probably a
huge effect on cardio-vascular mortality.
DR is a procedure used in laboratory and clinical studies to better understand,
particularly, how to decrease the toll of obesity or cardio-vascular diseases. However,
it is a risky business if not done in a controlled study in a laboratory under strict
supervision of physicians. Thus, people involved in, for instance, the CALERIE
study are not at risk, but those who decide to restrict their food intake on their own
are at risk, particularly if they are rather old. It is maybe not surprising that DR is so
fashionable in the USA, because obesity is an important problem for a large part of
the US population. One may argue that people wishing to live long and not to become
obese should first adopt safe behaviours: discarding junk food and snacking, eating
more moderately than the current US food intake, making exercise. It is often a hard
challenge to modify a behaviour, particularly when the social environment does not
encourage to do it, but it is the price to pay to enjoy a better healthspan.
###### **29.7 Detox Diets**

For many decades, not to say centuries or millennia, some people have claimed that
the organism could be auto-intoxicated and that it was necessary to clean the intestine,


-----

624 É. Le Bourg

as narrated by Frexinos (1997). This way, various recipes have been proposed to clean
the body and, more precisely, the intestine with purges (e.g. Guelpa 1910). Today,
colon cleansing, or colon hydrotherapy, is still in favour but the so-called detox diet,
which is in essence very similar to these old ideas, is more fashionable. While a very
fewpeopleadopt coloncleansingtodetoxifytheir body, therearenumerous proposals
of detox programs combining fasting, specific foods to clean the body, and physical
exercise. However, “commercial detox diets rarely identify the specific toxins they
aim to remove or the mechanisms by which they eliminate them” (Klein and Kiat
2015). These authors, reviewing the very few results on detox diets, concluded that
“considering the financial costs to consumers, unsubstantiated claims and potential
health risks of detox products, they should be discouraged by health professionals”
and, very wisely, that “there is no doubt that sustained healthy habits are of greater
long-term value than the quick fixes offered by commercial detox diets”. There is
not a single word to add.
###### **29.8 Fasting**

DR is not an easy way of life. Indeed, only a very few people are ready to restrict their
food intake for years or decades in the hope to live longer. In a way, it is accepting
a boring life and hoping it will last for longer than for other people, which is not
very enjoyable. It would be much better if a short DR, or repeated short bouts of DR
(intermittent fasting), could be used with the same results.
Fasting may have positive effects on health and survival to some threats. In *D.*
*melanogaster* flies, fasting increases survival to anoxia, a model of ischemia–reperfusion in flies (Vigne et al. 2009), or to cold (Le Bourg 2013). A 3-days fast with
water increases survival in mice subjected to renal ischemia-reperfusion, similarly
to a 4-weeks DR (Mitchell et al. 2010). One week after reperfusion the 10 fasted and
10 DR mice were alive but only 4 out of 10 of control ones. In addition, fasting with
chemotherapy helps mice to survive an artificial cancer more than chemotherapy
alone (Lee et al. 2012). In women with breast cancer, a randomised clinical trial
(de Groot et al. 2020) with 131 patients suggested that fasting before chemotherapy
could reduce the tumour more than chemotherapy alone in a per-protocol analysis
(comparing patients that really complied with the protocol), the results being less
clear in intention to treat (groups are compared even if some subjects did not respect
the protocol, as in real life). Fasting is thus studied by scientists and, for instance,
some authors wonder whether a preoperative fasting lasting more than the usual night
could improve surgical outcomes (Longchamp et al. 2017).
Therefore, fasting seems promising in therapy and some authors highly promote
it in books or media, as for instance Valter Longo (2018). Intermittent fasting is also
fashionable and, at a first sight, it could appear as a nice idea to preserve health
and, again, there are many sites promoting fasting cures on internet (e.g. in the US,
[https://thefastingmethod.com/, in France https://www.ffjr.com/) or in books. One of](https://thefastingmethod.com/)
the issues with intermittent fasting is that some authors are over-enthusiast to the


-----

29 The Fact and Fiction of Nutritional Claims … 625

point they write problematic sentences. For instance, de Cabo and Mattson (2020)
write that “on the island of Okinawa, the traditional population typically maintains a
regimen of intermittent fasting and has low rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus, as
well as extreme longevity”. However, such “extreme longevity” does not exist (see
above) and the Okinawa diet is not intermittent fasting: there is no fast for one or two
days from time to time, but an avoidance of eating at satiety. In addition, writing that
“clinical studies have focused mainly on overweight young and middle-age adults,
and we cannot generalize to other age groups the benefits and safety of intermittent
fasting”, is hazardous, as the main issue in elderly people is under-nutrition: it would
be risky for elderly people to fast more than they already and non-intentionally do.
People practicing intermittent fasting often say they feel better, with more energy.
This is true and can be easily explained. When a subject or an animal is fasting,
the nutritional needs are no longer satisfied, and the organism sounds the alarm
to implement various means to restore the previous physiological state. Thus, more
energy is diverted to seek food, at the expense of body reserves, cognition is in alert to
locate food, and so on. As said by Longo and Mattson (2014), “hunger is an adaptive
response to food deprivation that involves sensory, cognitive and neuroendocrine
changes that motivate and enable food-seeking behaviors”. The net result is that
animals or subjects are better at walk and people have the feeling they have a better
mood and cognition. A part of this process has been observed in *D. melanogaster* flies
by Connolly (1966). Flies deprived of food put in a novel environment maintain a
high activity level for at least 7 h, while ad libitum-fed flies show a regular time-linked
decrease.

This is what happens… at the beginning. After that, if fasting lasts for too long,
the available energy is decreasing and subjects can become sluggish, physically and
mentally. In other words, not too old people with a good health are not at risk if they
decide to fast for one day from time to time. Concluding that because they feel better,
more awake, and even smarter, intermittent fasting will improve healthspan and even
increase lifespan is an illusion linked to the physiological state occurring during a
short fasting. It has been shown that regular fasting during the whole life (4 days
every 2 weeks) could increase lifespan in mice (Sogawa and Cubo 2000), but it also
paradoxically increased their weight. This is probably not the result hoped by people
prone to fast, but it is also commonly observed in people under a restricted regimen.
They lose weight, before often to regain more, probably because the organism is
preparing to a next fast by making more reserves than before the fast: once bitten,
twice shy!
###### **29.9 Conclusions**

For centuries, if not millennia, people have hoped to enjoy a better health by modifying their diet. It is a sound idea and there is no debate on the necessity to favour a
regimen covering nutritional needs, but not more. However, it is not sensible to think


-----

626 É. Le Bourg

that miraculous regimens do exist: if it were the case, humans would have discovered them since time immemorial. In fact, humans have discovered the miraculous
regimen for a long life: a balanced regimen providing proteins, lipids and carbohydrates, as well as essential nutriments such as vitamins. Thus, a wise strategy is to
discard modern junk food known to favour cardio-vascular diseases and, eventually,
a shorter lifespan. Yet, it is also wise to resist ads promoting risky regimens with no
proteins, or only proteins, dietary supplements daily, detox diets, and all new avatars
of the modern quacks wearing a white blouse on a computer screen.
The global obesity epidemic is a real issue and the Covid-19 pandemic has shown
that, among the younger patients, those transferred in intensive care units were often
obese (e.g. Hajifathalian et al. 2020) and also that obesity increased the fatality risk
(de Larochelambert et al. 2020). It is maybe a sufficient reason to adopt an appropriate
food regimen and to discard other ones.

**Suresh I. S. Rattan and Gurcharan Kaur**

**Abstract** Here we recapitulate the main themes of the issues related to nutrition,
food and diet discussed in the twenty-nine chapters in this book. The insights from
various contributions have been extracted to conceptualize how nutritional components are not only the source of building blocks and energy for the body, but also
serve numerous critical functions in maintaining health. This wealth of information
can be useful for making recommendations and suggestions for food for health and
longevity, especially in old age. A central message derived from this collection of
articles is that optimizing our nutrition by making the right choice of food, and
aligning our eating behaviors with our bio-social rhythms, are the most effective
general strategies to maintain, recover and enhance individual- and public-health.

###### **30.1 Introduction**

Inthis volumeof thebookseries “HealthyAgeingandLongevity”, wehavesucceeded
in bringing together a diversified group of researchers and academicians reviewing
the published literature and presenting their personal views about nutritional components, foods, dietary patterns, and nutrition- and diet-based interventions for health
and longevity.
It is worth repeating from our preface to this volume that nutrition, food and diet

“nutrition” generally refers to the macro- and micro-nutrients essential for health and
survival, nutrition is normally obtained from animal- or plant-based foods. We do not

value of the food. Moreover, these nutritional values may or may not match our bodily
requirements which depend upon various factors, such as age, general health status,
physiological demands and accessibility. Even more importantly, there are crucial
socio-cultural dimensions which give shape to our taste, preferences and taboos
towards food (Samaddar et al. 2020). Furthermore, the three commonly identified
meals of the day – breakfast, lunch and dinner – are as varied globally as different
populations, societies and cultures. And above all of this lurks in the background
the evolutionary history of *Homo sapiens* from being hunter-gatherers to becoming
agriculturists (Finch 2010), and to the present state of becoming the consumers of
highly processed food products with overeating behaviors wherever food is available
in abundance.

In this concluding chapter, we try to recapitulate the main messages which can
be derived from various chapters in this book (Table 30.1), and how that information
can be useful for making recommendations and suggestions for practical use and for
future research. Perhaps the central carry home message is obvious that optimizing
our nutrition by making the “right” choice of food and aligning our eating behaviors
with our bio-social rhythms are the most effective general strategies to maintain,
recover and even enhance individual- and public-health.
###### **30.2 Nutrition**

Proteins, carbohydrates and lipids are the three essential nutritional components
which provide us the basic material for building our biological structures and for
producing the energy required for all physiological and biochemical processes. Additionally, minerals and micronutrients, including vitamins, facilitate the optimal utilisation of the primary nutritional components by catalyzing numerous biochemical
processes, by increasing their bioavailability and absorption, and by balancing the
microbiome crucial for maintaining health *(see Chapters 1 to 5).* Another category
of nutrients, termed nutritional hormetins, are various compounds in the food, which
by virtue of their toxic nature, induce and stimulate body’s intrinsic repair and maintenance systems. This apparently paradoxic effects of toxic compounds in the food
as health-beneficial nutritional hormetins is in line with the basic understanding
of the biological mechanisms of health and survival through adaptive responses and
hormesis (Rattan and Kyriazis 2019) *(see chapter 6).* Furthermore, it is in this context
that we need to understand and appreciate the evolutionary basis of human nutritional
requirements *(see chapter 7).* This is also the basis of understanding human nutrigenomics (how nutritional components affect gene expression) and nutrigenetics (how
our genetic heterogeneity affects our response to various nutrients) (Mutch et al.
2005; Wittwer et al. 2011).

###### **30.3 Food**

Almost all the food we eat is of the animal and plant origin, although continuing
advancements in nutrition research and innovation of food industry may open up
new vistas including man-made synthetic foods. Besides the inherent nutritional
composition of plant- and animal-based foods, farming and agricultural practices,
methods of food preparation and preservation, and the amounts consumed are equally
important factors for their eventual health benefits (see *chapter 8 and 9* ). Moreover,
prevalent climatic conditions and the local production of raw materials have always
challenged human-beings across civilizations and cultures to explore and develop
different processes of preservation and modification, such as fermentation. The
claimed health benefits of fermented foods are attributed to a combination of bioactive components released as by-products of the fermentation process and the presence
of probiotics in these foods, which support the gut microbiota (see *chapter 9* ).


-----

30 Nutrition, Food and Diet: Recapitulation, Conclusions and Suggestions 637

Various foods consumed traditionally in different cultures, and some of the claims
made for their potential modes of action, have been scientifically validated to some
extent. Such foods are often touted as complete foods, anti-inflammatory foods, food
for brain, food for physical endurance, functional foods and so on (see *chapter 11–*
*13* ).Traditionalfoodsenrichedwithavarietyofphytoconstituentsandotherminerals,
vitamins and natural or synthetic hormetins are generally promoted under the banner
of “functional foods”. A similar trend can be seen for milk and dairy products with
novel and innovative formulationswith a focus on functionality, health, and easy
availability (see *chapter 10* ).
###### **30.4 Diet and Culture**

The next stage after having access to food is the manner in which that food is
consumed, and that is what gives it the status of becoming diet or a meal. This
is also where the socio-cultural aspects of dietary habits and traditions become more
important than the biochemistry and molecular biology of the nutritional components
of food (Samaddar et al. 2020). The so-called Mediterranean diet, paleo diet, ketogenic diet, Chinese diet, Ayurvedic diet, vegetarian diet, and more recently, vegan
diet, are some of the varied expressions of such social and cultural practices ( *see*
*chapter 15-18* ). The health outcomes of these variety of dietary and mealing patterns
prevalent in different cultures have been helpful in cross-cultural adaptation to both
healthy eating patterns on one hand and bringing awareness about the health-risk
associations of certain food habits on the other. It is in this context that the subject
of chrononutrition, that is how our daily rhythms affect and regulate our nutritional
needs, has become an important aspect of healthy eating *(see chapters 17, 18).* Similarly, the so-called “nutrient timing” involves eating foods at strategic times in order
to achieve certain outcomes, such as muscle growth, sports performance and fat loss
(Kessler and Pivovarova-Ramich 2019). Looking back into the cultural history of
longevity foods, one realizes that it is not just the right combination of nutrients
which is important, but the elaborate social practices, rituals and normative behaviors for obtaining, preparing and consuming food are equally, if not more, important
aspects of health-promoting eating ( *see chapter 20* ).
Thus, dietary patterns and meal-timing seem to be more predictive of healthrelated quality of life than foods or nutrients on their own (Fontana and Partridge
2015; Kessler and Pivovarova-Ramich 2019). Encouraging a shift to healthy dietary
patterns, however, critically depends not only on the food availability, accessibility
and affordability, but also on the behavioral, intentional and socio-cultural conditions
of consumers for making their food choices. An old saying that “we are what we
eat” may be corrected to that “we eat what we are”!

###### **30.5 Nutritional and Dietary Interventions**

Food is often considered as one of the three pillars of human health and survival
– the other two being physical activity, and social and mental engagement. Therefore, manipulating and modifying food components and food habits have always
been attractive targets for intervention. This is exemplified by extensive research
done on the effects of individual nutrients, short peptides, and plant extracts in
stimulating, inhibiting or regulating various molecular pathways in relation to
ageing, and age-related diseases, including cancer, in experimental animal model
systems and cells in culture *(see chapters 21, 23, 28).* More recently, singlenutrient-based or multiple-nutrients-based selective killing of senescent cells, and
calorie restriction mimetics as anti-ageing therapies are being tested and developed
*(see chapters 22, 25).* These therapeutic strategies follow the same “one target,
one missile” pharmaceutical rationale, and consider ageing as a treatable disease.
However, often the promises made, based on the results obtained from such experimental studies, are either naïve extrapolations from experimental model systems or
overhyped claims for human applications, which deliver very little in reality (Rattan
2020) *(see chapter 29).*
Some other innovative, holistic and relatively easy to implement food- and dietbased interventions strategies are caloric/dietary restriction and time restricted eating
(TRE) regimens. For example, intermittent fasting (IF), based on feeding/fasting
timing manipulation, is emerging as a promising intervention to promote health
and longevity. Meta-analyses of several pilot studies in human subjects show that
TRE, with eating restricted to a few hours in the day time, has beneficial effects on
several health parameters (Mattson et al. 2014) ( *see chapter 24* ). Similarly, several
other practical recommendations are made for the optimal nutrition in old age ( *see*
*chapter 26* ), and for the regulation of metabolic syndromes, especially metabesity
( *see chapter, 27* ). **30.6 Conclusions and Suggestions**

Food is more than just being one of the three pillars of health. Food is both the
foundation and the scaffolding for the building and survival of an organism on a
daily basis. Scientific research on the macro- and micro-nutrient components of food
has developed deep understanding of their molecular, biochemical and physiological
roles. Various recommendations are repeatedly made and modified for some optimal
daily requirements of nutrients for maintaining and enhancing health, and for the
prevention and treatment of diseases. Can one envisage developing a “nutrition pill”
for perfect health, which could be used globally, across cultures, and at all ages? We
don’t think so.

So far, most of our knowledge about nutrients comes from the experimental studies
made with individual active components, or, at best, with the combination of one

or two compounds. However, in reality, we obtain these nutrients from the food
where they exist together with hundreds of other interacting compounds, and become
modified through the process of cooking and preservation. Scientifically, there is very
little known about the health-related effects of innumerable combinations of food

sources, cooking methods, dietary combinations and other factors. However, there
is a lot of folk knowledge available in all cultures about the dos and don’ts of food,
for which we need scientific verification and validation. For this purpose, we must
rethink and modify our presently established scientific protocols of double blinded
randomized control trials which are practically impossible to apply on food and
dietary research at the population level.
Finally, nutrition, food and diet are the basis of life, health and longevity. We have
gathered a huge amount of information with respect to what nutrition is required for
health and survival, which foods can provide what nutrition and to what extent, and
which dietary and eating practices seem to be more or less health beneficial. Whereas
in some parts of the world, abundant availability and accessibility of food has led
to its overuse, abuse and consequent life-style diseases, in other parts of the world
economic disparity and food scarcity keep perpetuating starvation, malnutrition,
poor health and shortened lifespan. It is usually not the lack of knowledge about the
optimal nutrition, food and diet that forces us to make bad choices; rather it is either
our inability to access such foods, or our gullibility to fall prey to the exaggerated
claims in the commercial interests of the food companies, which determine what and
how much we consume. Science will and must continue to gather more information
about the biochemical, physiological and other aspects of food, which we should
apply wisely and globally for the health and longevity of all.
