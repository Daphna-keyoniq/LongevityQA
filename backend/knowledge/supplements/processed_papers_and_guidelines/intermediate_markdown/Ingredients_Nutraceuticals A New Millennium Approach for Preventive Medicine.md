#### **Preface and Acknowledgments**

The field of nutraceuticals and bioactive compounds is expanding quickly, as are
related subfields such as functional foods and dietary supplements. These compounds, which provide potential health advantages beyond basic nutrition, lie in
between food and drugs. Vitamins, minerals, herbal extracts, probiotics, omega-3
fatty acids, and other bioactive components are all included in the broader category
of nutraceuticals. Capsules, pills, powders, liquids, and functional meals are just
some of the forms they come in that may be taken orally. The main goal of nutraceuticals is to promote general health and well-being by delivering beneficial nutrients
or bioactive substances. The chance of developing chronic illnesses like diabetes,
obesity, and cardiovascular problems may be decreased, while the immune system
can be strengthened, mental performance can be improved, heart health can be promoted, joint health can be supported, energy levels can be increased, and so on.

The present book entitled “Nutraceuticals: A New Millennium Approach for
Preventive Medicine” is focusing on very important aspects of health science and
disease management, through nutraceuticals. In fact, the preventive use of nutraceuticals is a promising radical new trend for a variety of diseases and disorders. In the
first part of the book, an overview of nutraceuticals is presented (Chap. 1) as well as
foundation of nutraceuticals in preventive medicine (Chap. 2). Chapter 3 addresses
the nutrients in metabolism and Xenobiotics. Chapter 4 dedicates to role of nutraceuticals in the prevention of cancer. Chapters 5 and 6 explain the importance of
nutraceuticals in metabolic syndrome and diabetes, and prevention of chronic renal
disease, respectively. The influence of nutraceuticals on the treatment and/or prevention of some other diseases/disorders has been discussed in Chaps. 7, 8, 9, and
10, including chronic pancreatitis (Chap. 7), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(Chap. 8), inflammatory autoimmune diseases (Chap. 9), and infertility (Chap. 10).
The final part of the book is dedicated to the relationship between nutraceuticals and
suboptimal health (Chap. 11), and effect of excess intake of nutrients on human
health (Chap. 12).
We are conscious of other diseases/disorders and their treatment/prevention with
nutraceuticals which could have been addressed. We look forward that this edition

will be well received and hopefully in the close future, other health issues can be

###### **1 Introduction**

Medicines derived from plant and animal extracts have been utilized by humans for
a wide variety of reasons going all the way back to antiquity. Dr. Stephen first used
the word “Nutraceuticals“in 1989 to describe a product that combines nutritional
supplements with pharmaceuticals. Since the advent of modern pet care in the
1990s, nutraceuticals have seen significant development, mirroring developments in
the human health industry at the same time. The definition of nutraceuticals was
broadened by the passing of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of
1994 to include vitamins, minerals, herbs and other botanicals, amino acids, and
dietary substances for human use as dietary supplements. When compared to the
more well-known dietary supplements, the word “nutraceutical” is not widely recognised on worldwide regulatory systems. Today, consumers may choose from
more than 470 nutraceutical and functional food items that have been shown to

improve health.
Traditional treatments work because someone figured out how to combine foods
in such a way that their effects complement one another. Medical professionals now

have a mythical status as saviours who can perform miracles and heal any ailment.
Seventy percent of patients, according to a recent survey, see a doctor before or during conventional treatment, suggesting that these individuals are not fond of alternative medicine. Patients, on the other hand, have a good idea of the potential dangers
posed by chemical agents in both short and long-term treatment. As a result, there
has been a rise in the popularity of preventative medicine, with the subsequent push
for further investigation into alternative treatments, particularly those that make use
of nutritional techniques. This article summarizes key information on the therapeutic use of nutraceuticals as both modern and traditional medicines (Padmavathi 2018).

The field of nutraceuticals is expanding quickly, as are related subfields such as
functional foods and dietary supplements. These items, which provide potential
health advantages beyond basic nutrition, lie in between food and drugs. Vitamins,
minerals, herbal extracts, probiotics, omega-3 fatty acids, and other bioactive components are all included in the broader category of nutraceuticals. Capsules, pills,
powders, liquids, and functional meals are just some of the forms they come in that
may be taken orally. The main goal of nutraceuticals is to promote general health
and well-being by delivering beneficial nutrients or bioactive substances. The
chance of developing chronic illnesses like diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular
problems may be decreased, while the immune system can be strengthened, mental
performance can be improved, heart health can be promoted, joint health can be
supported, energy levels can be increased, and so on.

Nutraceuticals have shown promise for a variety of uses, including disease prevention. People who want more natural and holistic approaches to their health problems often turn to these methods as a supplement to conventional care. Nutraceuticals
are thought to be effective because they modulate biological processes, increase
antioxidant capacity, and reduce inflammation. They are also useful for treating
vitamin deficits brought on by improper eating habits or medical problems. Rising
consumer awareness and interest in preventative healthcare have been major factors
in the development of the global nutraceuticals market in recent years. More and
more people are taking responsibility for their health and looking for methods to
make positive changes, such as adopting healthier eating habits and using nutritional supplements, to achieve better overall health. More effective and specific
nutraceutical products have been developed thanks to developments in scientific
research and manufacturing technology (Pandey et al. 2010).

Different nations have various standards for the safety, effectiveness, labelling,
and marketing claims that may be made for nutraceuticals. The manufacturing,
labelling, and marketing of nutraceuticals are subject to strict rules in several parts
of the world, including the United States and the European Union. These rules exist
to protect consumers from harm and to stop false or misleading statements from
being made about the items’ purported health advantages. While it’s true that nutraceuticals show great promise, each person’s experience with them may be unique
due to variables including genetics, lifestyle, and pre-existing illnesses. Also, people should be careful and talk to their doctors before adding nutraceuticals to their
daily routine, particularly if they are already on medicine or have pre-existing health
issues. For the same reasons, it’s important to only buy nutraceuticals from dependable brands (Verma et al. 2010).

1 A Brief Overview of Nutraceuticals
###### **2 History**


3


The idea of employing food as medicine goes back to ancient cultures, demonstrating the longevity of the nutraceutical industry. Nutritional supplements and functional foods have been used for their health advantages for centuries, even before
the word “nutraceutical” was coined in the late twentieth century. The Egyptians,
Greeks, and Chinese, among others, were well aware of the healing potential of
certain foods and plants. Honey, garlic, turmeric, and ginger were among the compounds employed for their therapeutic effects. Indian traditional medicine, known
as Ayurveda, places a strong emphasis on the curative and preventative powers of
herbs, spices, and carefully planned meal combinations. Hippocrates, the ancient
Greek physician often credited as the “father of modern medicine,” understood the
crucial role diet had in his patients’ health. Among his most well-known quotes is
“Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.” Hippocrates promoted the use
of certain meals for illness prevention and treatment, with an emphasis on the
medicinal qualities of plants and herbs (Verma et al. 2010).

There was a revival of curiosity in the curative powers of foods and plants
throughout the Renaissance. Explorers of this period brought back exotic plants and
spices from all over the globe, many of which were highly sought for their purported medicinal properties. Citrus fruits’ high vitamin C content, for instance,
proved useful to explorers in warding off scurvy. Some of the most important nutrients for human health were first singled out and isolated by scientists in the late 19th
and early 20th centuries. The finding of vitamin C and, subsequently, the B vitamins, transformed our knowledge of nutrition and its effect on health. To fight
iodine shortage and prevent goitre, essential foods like salt were fortified during this
time period by being iodized.

Dr. Stephen DeFelice, who founded and chairs the Foundation for Innovation in
Medicine (FIM), is credited with coining the word “nutraceutical” in 1989. Dr.
DeFelice used the word to refer to compounds that could have positive effects on
health beyond those of regular eating. He saw nutraceuticals as a link between
healthy eating and medications, emphasizing both fields’ abilities to combat illness.
Advances in scientific research, rising public interest in preventive healthcare, and
the invention of dietary supplements all contributed to the late twentieth-century
explosion in the area of nutraceuticals. Nutritional supplements including vitamins,
minerals, and botanical extracts have helped propel the nutraceutical business into
the mainstream (Andlauer and Fürst 2002).

Increased consumer knowledge and desire for natural health products drove
explosive expansion in the dietary supplement business in the 1990s. In the United
States, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994 established dietary supplements as a distinct sector of the food and medicine industries.
Functional meals, drinks, and customized supplements are just some of the nutraceutical goods that have seen rapid growth in the twenty-first century. As people
looked for easy methods to integrate healthful components into their diets, functional foods, which are fortified or supplemented with certain nutrients or bioactive
chemicals, rose in popularity.

R. Parashar et al.


During this time period, scientists made strides in their knowledge of nutraceuticals as they uncovered the mechanisms of action and possible health advantages of
diverse substances. The advantages of probiotics for gut health and immunological
function, for instance, and the importance of omega-3 fatty acids in cardiovascular
health, both of which received a lot of press recently. Increasing consumer awareness, aging demographics, and a focus on preventative healthcare have all contributed to the expansion of the worldwide nutraceutical business. It covers a broad
spectrum of items, from nutritional supplements to functional meals and drinks
aimed at improving one’s health in a particular way (Andlauer and Fürst 2002).

The nutraceutical business, however, still faces obstacles. Nutraceutical product
safety, effectiveness, and quality remain a concern despite the fact that regulatory
structures differ from country to country. The efficacy of various nutraceuticals and
the best way to employ them in disease management and prevention is also a topic
of continuing discussion and study.
###### **3 Nutraceuticals**

As people are living longer and experiencing a greater variety of lifestyle-related
illnesses, nutraceuticals have become an absolute must-have for consumers. It falls
much below the definition of “Food for special dietary use” in India. Nutraceuticals
are a vast and varied class of substances that are found naturally in plants. The term
is used to describe substances derived from food that are said to have therapeutic
effects on humans. Dr. Stephen DeFelice combined the terms “nutrition” and
“pharmaceutical“to create the term “Nutraceutical” in 1989. DeFelice defines a
nutraceutical as a food or dietary component that has health benefits beyond basic
nutrition, such as the ability to treat or prevent disease. Despite being classified as
non-nutritive, several of these chemicals have beneficial properties such as antioxidant, anti-mutagenic, anti-estrogenic, anti-carcinogenic, and anti-inflammatory
effects that might aid in disease prevention and the maintenance of genomic stability. From genetically modified designer meals and natural ingredients to processed
foods like cereals, soups, and beverages, the items cover a wide variety of needs.
The term “nutraceutical” is widely used in advertising without a corresponding
regulatory definition in the United States. The demand for chemical-free, all-natural
food additives is a major emerging trend in the food industry (Lunin 1881).

The food, pharmaceutical, and nutraceutical sectors all saw major shifts as a
result of the rising interest in health and wellness. The demand for nutraceuticals
has skyrocketed, both in developed economies and those on the rise. More and more
people are turning to nutraceutical products in an effort to maintain a healthy weight,
lower their blood pressure, and reduce their risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease (Sharma and Majumdar 2009) (Fig. 1.1).

They have a long track record of success, a relatively modest price tag, a high
level of patient acceptance, and a solid reputation as a result of these factors. The
most crucial reason is that herbal products give a sensible approach to the treatment

of many illnesses that may be tenacious and incurable. Extracts and refined bioactive components are often the foundation from which nutraceutical products are
constructed. The capacity of the costly plant *Psoralea corylifolia* to carry a nutraceutical with energetic biocomponents is being investigated. Hippocrates, the
widely acknowledged father of modern medicine (460–377 B.C), popularized the
adage “Let food be thy remedy, and medicine be thy meals” to stress the importance
of a healthy diet to one’s overall well-being (Sharma and Majumdar 2009).
###### ***3.1 Types of Nutraceuticals***

In addition to their nutritional value, nutraceuticals also have additional positive
effects on human health. They’re meant to help in general, help with certain health
issues, and fill a void between food and medications. Vitamins, minerals, herbal
extracts, probiotics, omega-3 fatty acids, and many more bioactive chemicals are
only some of the topics covered in this article on nutraceuticals (Ahmad et al. 2011)
(Fig. 1.2).

**Vitamins** Vitamins are chemical molecules that the body needs to function properly. Vitamin C and the B vitamins are examples of water-soluble vitamins, whereas
vitamins A, D, E, and K are examples of fat-soluble vitamins. Vitamins play a crucial role in ensuring proper metabolic function, bolstering the immune system, fostering healthy development, and warding against vitamin shortages. You may get
them in pill, tablet, and multivitamin forms, all of which are used as dietary
supplements.

R. Parashar et al.


**Minerals** The body can’t operate properly without minerals, which are inorganic
compounds. Calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron, and even selenium are all in there, and
they’re all really important. Bone and muscle health, energy generation, enzyme
functioning, and many other physiological activities all rely on minerals. Mineral-­
specific dietary supplements are popular for their purported ability to treat deficiency symptoms, alleviate the symptoms of certain diseases, and improve
general health.

**Herbal Extracts** Herbal extracts, made from a wide variety of plants, have been
utilized for millennia in alternative medicine. They have health-promoting bioactive
substances. Ginkgo biloba, turmeric (curcumin), green tea, and garlic all have
extracts that are widely used. Antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and
other therapeutic activities may be present in these extracts. Capsules, powders, and
teas are only some of the delivery methods for herbal extracts.

**Probiotics** Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that may be eaten orally. They are
most often linked to helping maintain a good microbiome balance in the stomach.
Beneficial bacteria like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are often used in probiotics. These microbes have been shown to aid in the digestive process, increase nutritional absorption, strengthen the immune system, and keep the gut microbiome
balanced. You can get probiotics in fermented foods like yogurt and kefir, as well as
in pill form and powder form.

**Omega-3 Fatty Acids** Omega-3 fatty acids are a form of PUFAs that play a crucial
role in maintaining good health. Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and sardines are a
good source of these acids, namely eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Anti-inflammatory characteristics and possible advantages to cardiovascular health, cognitive function, and joint health are among the many reasons
omega-3 fatty acids have gained popularity. Fish oil capsules and plant-based equivalents made from algae or flaxseed are two common forms of omega-3
supplementation.

**Antioxidants** Antioxidants are chemicals that assist prevent cellular harm from
free radicals by neutralizing those radicals. Unstable chemicals called free radicals
have been linked to cellular damage and illness. Vitamins C and E, beta-carotene,
selenium, and the many polyphenols found in fruits, vegetables, and tea are all
examples of antioxidants. Antioxidants may aid in immune system function, lessen
the likelihood of developing chronic illnesses, and encourage healthy aging. They
may be gained from a diet high in fruits, vegetables, and whole foods, or as dietary
supplements (Ahmad et al. 2011).

**Fibre Supplements** The digestive system relies on dietary fibre, which is why it’s
so important. It aids in weight management, improves cardiovascular health, and
encourages regular bowel motions. Fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are the best
sources of dietary fibre, but fibre supplements may help fill in the gaps if your diet
is lacking. The fibre in these aids may be from psyllium husk, inulin, or glucomannan, or it may be insoluble fibre.
###### **4 Sources of Nutraceuticals**

Plants, animals, microbes, and even synthetic processes are all potential origins for
nutraceuticals. These plants and animals offer the raw ingredients used to make
nutraceutical goods, many of which include a wide variety of bioactive chemicals.
This article delves into where various nutraceuticals come from and why they’re so
important to the creation of healthful goods (Verma et al. 2022).

(i) **Plant-Based Sources**

Nutraceuticals may be found in abundance in plant foods since they include many
different bioactive components. Plants are the source of many of the active substances in nutraceuticals, including herbal extracts, botanical compounds, and phytochemicals. Some instances are:

- **Herbs and Spices:** Curcumin, gingerol, allicin, cinnamaldehyde, and flavonoids

are just a few examples of the bioactive compounds found in herbs and spices
including turmeric, ginger, garlic, cinnamon, and ginkgo biloba; these compounds demonstrate antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and other
health-promoting effects.

R. Parashar et al.



- **Fruits and Vegetables:** Vitamins, minerals, fibre, and phytochemicals are all

easily obtained from a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. Antioxidants, polyphenols, carotenoids, and other bioactive substances are especially concentrated in
berries, citrus fruits, cruciferous vegetables, leafy greens, and other colourful food.

- **Medicinal Plants:** For generations, people have relied on the healing qualities of

several plants that are now considered traditional medicines. Herbal supplements
like aloe vera, echinacea, chamomile, ashwagandha, and ginseng are all good
examples.

- **Tea and Herbal Infusions:** Antioxidants, polyphenols, and other beneficial

components may be found in beverages including green tea, black tea, white tea,
and herbal infusions produced from plants like chamomile, peppermint, and
hibiscus (Verma et al. 2022).

(ii) **Animal-Based Sources**

The unique bioactive chemicals found in animal sources of some nutraceuticals are
one reason for their health benefits. Instances include:

- **Fish and Seafood:** Omega-3 fatty acids, especially EPA and DHA, found in fatty

fish like salmon, mackerel, sardines, and trout have been linked to improved
cardiovascular health, cognitive function, and inflammatory control. Omega-3
fatty acid supplements in the form of fish oil are quite popular.

- **Collagen:** Supporting joint health, skin elasticity, and tissue integrity, collagen is

a structural protein present in the skin, bones, and connective tissues of animals.

- **Bee Products:** Honey, royal jelly, bee pollen, and propolis are all products of

bees that have been studied for their possible health benefits due to the presence
of bioactive chemicals such as antioxidants, antibacterial agents, and anti-­
inflammatory molecules.

- **Animal-Derived Enzymes:** Digestive enzymes including proteases, lipases, and

amylases are only some of the enzymes that may be sourced from animals and
employed in nutraceutical compositions (Verma et al. 2022).

(iii) **Microorganisms**

Nutraceuticals rely heavily on the work of microorganisms like bacteria, yeast, and
algae. Instances include:

- **Probiotics:** Probiotics are good bacteria that occur mostly in the digestive tract

and may be taken as dietary supplements. Probiotics are often made from bacteria like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium.

- **Yeast Extracts:** Bioactive substances, vitamins, and minerals are all provided by

yeast extracts like *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* . They’re a common ingredient in
nutraceuticals since they’re rich in useful nutrients..

- **Algae:** Due to their high protein, vitamin, mineral, and antioxidant content,

algae like spirulina and chlorella are categorized as nutraceuticals (Holzapfel
et al. 2001).


-----

1 A Brief Overview of Nutraceuticals 9

(iv) **Synthetic Processes**

To improve their efficacy or bioavailability, several nutraceuticals are manufactured by chemical procedures. Examples of such man-made dietary supplements
include:

- **Synthetic Antioxidants:** Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated

hydroxyanisole (BHA) are two man-made antioxidants often found in processed
foods and dietary supplements.

- **Synthetic Vitamins:** Vitamins that are often utilized in nutraceutical formula
tions may be produced in the lab; they include vitamins C (ascorbic acid) and E
(tocopherol).

- **Modified Bioactive Compounds:** Some bioactive substances may be made

more stable, bioavailable, or effective by chemical modification or extraction
methods (Holzapfel et al. 2001).
###### **5 Potential of Nutraceuticals**

The unique mix of nutritional and pharmacological qualities found in nutraceuticals
has demonstrated promising results in improving health and well-being. The health
advantages of these items extend well beyond those of simple diet since they are
sourced from natural sources including plants, herbs, and bioactive substances.
Nutraceuticals are gaining popularity among customers who want to improve their
overall health and treat particular health issues because of the growing interest in
preventative healthcare and the need for natural alternatives. Nutraceuticals have
great promise since they may improve health by helping the body perform better in
certain ways and by correcting nutritional imbalances. Nutraceutical supplements,
for instance, may assist guarantee an adequate intake of nutrients including vitamins
and minerals that are crucial to the body’s correct functioning. The immune system,
the cardiovascular system, and even mental performance may all get focused help
from nutraceuticals. Nutraceuticals, with their own blend of bioactive components,
provide a more all-encompassing strategy for improving health.

Nutraceuticals also have the potential to play a part in illness prevention and
management. Preventive benefits of some nutraceuticals against chronic illnesses
including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and neurological disorders have
been proposed by scientific investigations. Antioxidants in nutraceuticals, such as
polyphenols and flavonoids, may help lower the risk of oxidative stress-related illnesses because of their anti-inflammatory and free radical-scavenging characteristics. The use of nutraceuticals may promote healthy aging and enhance quality of
life in older adults. Conditions specific to old age and general health deterioration
are commonly mentioned in conjunction with aging. Some dietary supplements,
such as those containing resveratrol or coenzyme Q10, have been studied for their
potential to slow aging, improve cell health, and increase energy levels. Omega-3

R. Parashar et al.


fatty acid-rich supplements, such as fish oil, have also been investigated for their
possible positive effects on cognition and brain function.

Nutraceuticals have the potential to improve health and also have the benefit of
being safer and well-tolerated than traditional medications. Nutraceuticals, being
obtained from natural sources, are thought to have a decreased risk of unwanted
effects and to be typically well-tolerated. This makes them appealing to those who
prefer more natural remedies or who are wary of the possible negative effects of
prescription medications.

The promise of nutraceuticals, however, has to be understood with some care.
Despite the encouraging findings of several trials, further investigation into the
drugs’ mechanisms of action, appropriate doses, and possible drug interactions is
required. Furthermore, nutraceutical items might vary in quality and uniformity, so
it’s important to choose trustworthy brands and verify accurate labelling and production procedures (Holzapfel et al. 2001).

The promise of nutraceuticals rests on their capability to go above and beyond
the nutritional needs of the body. Bioactive chemicals have been the subject of substantial research for their potential therapeutic and preventative benefits against a
wide range of ailments. The following Table 1.1 summarizes several commonly
used nutraceuticals and the benefits they provide: (Mukherjee 2019).
Dolkar et al. (2017)
###### **6 Regulatory Aspects of Nutraceuticals**

Nutraceutical safety, quality, and effectiveness rely heavily on regulatory considerations. Since these items incorporate characteristics of both food and medicine,
regulation systems vary by country and area. Classification, labelling, ingredient
safety, production methods, and marketing claims are all common components of
nutraceutical regulation. Categorization of products as a regulatory component of
nutraceuticals. There may be variances in the language and concepts used to classify
nutraceuticals between countries. They might be considered nutritional supplements, functional meals, or even traditional herbal remedies in certain nations. What
kinds of labelling criteria apply, what kinds of claims are permissible, and so on for
nutraceuticals are all determined by their categorization (Witkamp and van
Norren 2018).

Compliance with labelling regulations is crucial for maintaining honesty in the
marketplace and giving buyers reliable data. Ingredients, dosing directions, storage
requirements, expiry dates, and allergy warnings are common information to find on
a nutraceutical’s label. Furthermore, rules frequently stipulate on what kinds of
claims may be made on the label, with the goal of preventing false or misleading
advertising and promoting instead the use of evidence-based practices. The regulation of the quality and security of ingredients is another important facet of nutraceuticals. Guidelines for the safety evaluation of substances used in nutraceutical
products are often established by regulatory authorities. The toxicological profile,

drug-drug interactions, and maximum safe doses may all factor into these recommendations. Furthermore, several nations have regulatory bodies that either approve
substances or set maximum contaminant levels.

Regulators keep an eye on production processes and quality assurance as well.
Guidelines established by the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) program set
the bar for the safe and reliable manufacture, distribution, and storage of nutraceuticals. Following Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) guidelines aids in avoiding
product contamination, guarantees truthful labelling, and boosts confidence in the
product’s safety and efficacy. Marketing claims for nutraceuticals are likewise governed by regulations. Consumers should not be misled, hence the claims must be
backed up by science. Companies may be required by regulatory organizations to
provide proof supporting the claims or to employ health claims that have already
been authorized. This safeguards customers’ ability to make educated purchases
and avoids deceptive advertising (Witkamp and van Norren 2018).

The nutraceutical sector cannot survive without strict enforcement of laws and

close monitoring of compliance. Inspections, audits, and random sampling are common methods used by regulatory organizations to verify whether a producer or
retailer is following the rules. There may be repercussions, such as fines, product
recalls, or even legal action, for failing to comply.

The worldwide nutraceutical business has a continuing challenge: harmonizing
regulatory requirements. Disparities in national legislation may impede international commerce and restrict people’s access to safe and effective goods. The worldwide commerce of nutraceuticals is being facilitated by efforts to harmonize
regulatory frameworks, develop international norms, and encourage mutual acceptance of safety evaluations.

###### **7 Nutraceuticals Versus Modern Medicines**


R. Parashar et al.


There are benefits and drawbacks to both nutraceuticals and conventional medical
treatment. Nutraceuticals are dietary supplements or functional foods obtained from
natural sources, as opposed to conventional medications which are created after
extensive scientific study and clinical trials. In this post, we’ll look at how nutraceuticals and conventional pharmaceuticals vary in terms of research and development,
effectiveness, safety, accessibility, and philosophy toward health care (Subbiah 2008).

(i) **Development Process**

**Modern Medicines** These days, the development of a new pharmaceutical follows
a strict protocol that includes plenty of research, animal testing, and human trials.
All of the pharmaceuticals go through rigorous testing for side effects, dosing, and
safety, thanks to these procedures. Before a drug may be authorized and sold, regulatory bodies like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States
impose stringent restrictions and regulations on the pharmaceutical industry.

**Nutraceuticals** Nutraceuticals, on the other hand, come from organic materials
including plants, animals, and microbes. Some of the substances in nutraceuticals
have been tested in clinical experiments, while many others are based on anecdotal
evidence and folklore. Nutraceutical research and development is often less standardized and controlled than those of conventional pharmaceuticals. Researching
the effectiveness and safety of nutraceutical components, however, is becoming
more popular.

(ii) **Efficacy**

**Modern Medicines** Today’s drugs are developed with pinpoint accuracy to address
individual illnesses and circumstances. In order to guarantee their effectiveness in
clinical settings, they are typically subjected to extensive testing. Evidence from
clinical trials and other forms of significant study confirms the effectiveness of
today’s medications. These drugs are designed to have predictable therapeutic
results, making them useful in the control and treatment of a wide range of medical issues.

**Nutraceuticals** In contrast to traditional pharmaceuticals used to cure illness,
nutraceuticals take the form of dietary supplements or functional foods. Nutraceutical
effectiveness may range widely based on factors including active ingredient, formulation, and dose. Although certain nutraceuticals have been shown to have positive
benefits in research, the proof for their effectiveness is typically scant and may not
satisfy the same stringent requirements as conventional pharmaceuticals.
Furthermore, genetics, nutrition, lifestyle, and general health may all play a role in
how a person responds to nutraceuticals.

(iii) **Safety**

**Modern Medicines** In order to identify possible hazards and side effects, modern
drugs go through thorough safety testing throughout the development process. The
safety profile of medications is continuously monitored, and adverse effects are
reported and examined, by regulatory bodies. However, even cutting-edge pharmaceuticals are not without potential hazards and unwanted consequences, particularly
in situations of incorrect dosing, drug interactions, and individual differences in
drug metabolism.

**Nutraceuticals** When produced from natural ingredients, nutraceuticals offer an
even better safety profile. However, the purity, extraction technique, formulation,
and dose of a nutraceutical may all affect its potential risk. Although many nutraceuticals have a good safety record, others may cause unwanted side effects due to
their components or drug interactions. If you have a pre-existing ailment or are
already on any kind of medicine, you should talk to your doctor before adding any
kind of nutraceutical to your regular routine.

(iv) **Availability and Accessibility**

**Modern Medicines** Modern medications may be obtained either with a doctor’s
prescription or without one at most drugstores. Availability and quality of contemporary medications are ensured by stringent regulations on their production and
delivery. However, variables including healthcare systems, pricing, and geography
might affect how easily people can get their hands on contemporary drugs. In certain circumstances, especially in underdeveloped nations or outlying locations,
access to modern medications may be restricted.

**Nutraceuticals** Nutraceuticals may be found in a wide variety of grocery shops,
health food stores, and even online without the need for a doctor’s prescription.
Their availability is high, and there is a plethora of alternatives for buyers to consider. However, assuring the uniformity, purity, and regulated dose of these products
may be difficult due to the absence of strong standards and quality control in the
nutraceutical business.

(v) **Approach to Healthcare**

**Modern Medicines** Disease prevention and treatment are the main focuses of
modern medicine. They treat symptoms, cure illnesses, and manage chronic disorders by focusing on certain pathways, chemicals, or receptors in the body. Science,
evidence-based standards, and a reductionist mindset form the basis of today’s medical practice, which seeks to find particular molecular targets for intervention.

**Nutraceuticals** Nutraceuticals are health supplements that adopt a more all-­
encompassing view of medicine by highlighting the connection between diet and
illness prevention. They are often used as non-traditional or supplementary treatments. The purpose of nutraceuticals is to improve health by supplementing the diet
with bioactive chemicals and nutrients that may be deficient. Personalized nutrition,

in which consumers’ dietary requirements and tastes are taken into account while
developing a final product, is also linked to nutraceuticals (Table 1.2).
###### **8 Current Scenario**

The future of the nutraceutical business in India is bright. Products have expanded
greatly in variety during the last decade, reflecting the market’s explosive development. One positive effect of the thriving economy is that people’s take-home pay
has gone up. A rise in diet-related health problems has also been linked to the combination of bad eating habits and inactivity. However, there is a growing understanding of the connection between what we eat and our long-term health. These factors
have helped create a conducive environment for the growth of India’s nutraceutical
business. Numerous factors, including India’s highly educated workforce, cutting-­
edge R&D facilities, and abundant raw materials, put us at an international advantage. There is a potential USD 1 Billion in the Indian nutritional market. When
compared to the worldwide market’s CAGR of 7%, the Indian market’s CAGR of


-----

18% over the previous three years has been very impressive. However, India’s
untapped market is worth between $2 and $4 billion, or two to four times the size of
the present industry, with around 148 million potential clients. In a USD 1 billion
market, 54% is held by functional food, 32% by dietary supplements, and 14% by
functional beverages. There are very few pure play nutraceutical enterprises in the
Indian industry, which is dominated by the pharmaceutical and fast moving consumer goods industries. GlaxoSmithKline consumer healthcare, Dabur India, Cadila
healthcare, EID Parry’s, Zandu Pharmaceuticals, Himalaya herbal healthcare,
Amway, Sami labs, Elder pharmaceuticals, and Ranbaxy are only few of the main
firms marketing nutraceuticals in India.

The present state of the nutraceutical market is indicative of the trend away from
reactive medicine and towards preventative medicine. Consumers are increasingly
interested in using natural remedies to improve their health, manage chronic illnesses, and maintain an overall state of wellness, which has led to a rise in the
demand for nutraceuticals. The potential, threats, and developments in the nutraceutical market are discussed in this chapter. The nutraceutical industry is growing as a
result of rising interest in and demand for health and wellness-oriented goods. More
and more people are realizing that what they eat directly affects how they feel and
how long they live. They are on the lookout for goods that may help them achieve
certain health goals and avoid illness. Due to customers’ newfound willingness to
spend money on wellness goods, the nutraceutical industry has seen explosive
growth (Zelig and Rigassio Radler 2012).

Increases in the number of people suffering from conditions like diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease have also contributed to the growth of the nutraceutical industry. A lack of exercise and unhealthy eating habits have been related to
these diseases. Nutraceuticals are increasingly seen as a practical strategy for controlling and preventing chronic illnesses due to their ability to alleviate nutritional
deficiencies and offer therapeutic effects. Because of this, doctors are starting to
include nutraceutical supplements in patient care programs. The nutraceutical market has become more specialized to address various customer needs and preferences. As a simple and tasty approach to improve one’s health, functional meals and
drinks have become more popular. Bioactive substances including probiotics, antioxidants, fiber, and omega-3 fatty acids are often included to these products.
Targeted nutritional supplementation in the form of capsules, pills, and powders is
also seeing a surge in popularity.

The rise of individualized nutrition is another interesting development.
Companies may now provide customized nutraceuticals according to customers’
health profiles, genetic data, or biomarkers thanks to scientific developments and
widespread access to genetic testing. By taking this route, individuals are better able
to meet their unique dietary requirements and experience positive health benefits.
Artificial intelligence and data analytics are predicted to become more integrated
into the field of personalized nutrition, leading to more precise and individualized
product recommendations. Research and development efforts are also advancing in
the nutraceutical business. The effectiveness and mechanisms of action of different

nutraceutical components are now being investigated in many research

investigations. This study is crucial because it will help back up the health claims
made for nutraceuticals. Innovative delivery technologies are also being developed
to improve the bioavailability and stability of nutraceutical substances, leading to
greater absorption and efficacy in the body.

Nutraceutical companies, however, have their own set of problems. Safety regulations and testing for potential hazards are a major issue. When it comes to nutraceuticals, the regulatory environment differs from country to country due to
differences in registration procedures and health claim validity. Maintaining customer confidence and defending public health require that nutraceutical goods be
tested for safety, effectiveness, and quality. To overcome these issues, it is crucial to
implement stringent quality control methods, adhere to good manufacturing standards, and use clear labelling. There is a variety of nutraceutical goods on the market, making it difficult for customers to navigate and make educated decisions.
Consumers’ bewilderment and skepticism might be exacerbated by health claims
that are either false or overblown. It is essential for consumers to be well-versed in

nutraceuticals in order to make well-informed choices (Zelig and Rigassio
Radler 2012).
###### **9 Conclusion**

In conclusion, nutraceuticals have become a promising new class of goods because
of their ability to combine the best of both the food industry and the pharmaceutical
industry. By fusing the dietary advantages of food with targeted bioactive molecules, they may promote health and well-being. Vitamins, minerals, herbs, botanicals, enzymes, and many more compounds are all considered nutraceuticals. These
items are often used in functional meals or as dietary supplements. Nutraceuticals
have become more popular due to rising interest in preventative healthcare and a
need for all-natural remedies. Supplements and dietary changes are being sought
out by many as strategies to improve general health and lower the danger of developing certain illnesses. Nutraceuticals are dietary supplements that promise extra
health advantages on top of those already provided by healthy eating and regular
exercise.

The chapters in this book provide an in-depth exploration of the role of nutrients
and nutraceuticals in preventive medicine. It covers topics such as the prevention of
cancer, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, chronic renal disease, chronic pancreatitis,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, inflammatory autoimmune diseases, infertility, and suboptimal health. The chapters discuss how different nutrients can
impact human health positively and negatively, emphasizing the importance of balanced nutrition for overall well-being. It also delves into the remedial effects of
nutrients in various chronic diseases and the potential dangers of excessive nutrient
intake on human health. Overall, the chapters highlight the significant role of nutrients in maintaining and improving health outcomes.

###### **1 Introduction**

The intricate relationship and interaction between nutrients and physiology form the
foundation of our overall health and vitality. Their dynamic interaction is not static;
it constantly adapts and responds to our body’s changing needs. From the digestive
system’s role in absorbing, breaking down nutrients, and utilising the nutrients by
cells to the metabolism’s conversion of these nutrients into energy, every cellular
process and organ system relies on the availability and balance of essential nutrients
(Calder et al. 2020). By exploring this dynamic relationship, we can gain valuable
insights into how to make informed dietary choices that promote our well-being and
prevent nutritional deficiencies or imbalances (Chen et al. 2018). However, different
nutrients have specific roles and functions – carbohydrates are a primary energy
source, while proteins contribute to tissue growth and repair. Fats play a crucial role
in insulation, hormone production, and the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.
Vitamins and minerals are co-factors in enzymatic reactions, supporting various
physiological processes. Water is essential for maintaining hydration, facilitating

nutrient transport, and regulating body temperature (Slavin et al. 2012; Gómez-­
Gallego and Salminen 2021). The intricate relationship between nutrients and physiology extends beyond primary metabolism. Also, the nutrients interact with specific
organ systems, influencing their functions (calcium and vitamin D are essential for
bone health, and iron is crucial for oxygen transport through the circulatory system), significantly impacting the immune system (Wallace and Murray 2020; Holick
2017). Further, it has also been seen that physical activity and exercise highlight the
relationship between nutrients and cellular physiology. The body’s energy demands
increase during exercise, requiring additional nutrients for optimal performance and
recovery. Proper pre- and post-exercise nutrition, including carbohydrates for
energy and protein for muscle repair, can significantly impact exercise outcomes
and our body’s overall physiological functions (Bytomski 2018).

Therefore, understanding the dynamic relationship of essential nutrients required
for balanced physiological processes forms the fundamental basis of nutraceuticals
in preventive medicine. Nutraceuticals are bioactive compounds derived from food
sources that offer potential health benefits beyond their essential nutritional value.
The specific nutrients have bioactive properties that can positively impact physiological processes, including reducing inflammation, supporting antioxidant
defences, modulating immune function, and regulating cellular signalling pathways
(Russo 2019). In a regulated manner, these nutrients are formulated as nutraceuticals that help healthcare professionals in preventive medicine leverage the power of
targeted nutritional interventions. This, in return, promotes overall wellness, reduces
the risk of chronic diseases, is utilised to bridge dietary gaps and supports optimal
physiological functioning (Biesalski and Tinz 2018). These interventions can range
from personalised dietary recommendations to the use of specific nutrient supplements or functional foods fortified with bioactive compounds. The synergy between
nutraceuticals and balanced physiology is exemplified in personalised nutrition.
Advances in genetic testing and personalised medicine enable the identification of
individual genetic variations that influence nutrient metabolism, absorption, and
utilisation. This knowledge allows for developing tailored dietary plans and nutraceutical interventions that align with an individual’s unique physiological needs,
optimising health outcomes and disease prevention (Mayurasakorn et al. 2020).
Moreover, nutraceuticals offer a promising avenue for addressing nutrient deficiencies or imbalances which may arise from poor dietary choices, restrictive diets,
malabsorption disorders, or specific health conditions. The preventive potential of
nutraceuticals extends to various chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic syndrome.
Scientific evidence suggests that specific nutraceuticals, such as omega-3 fatty
acids, polyphenols, curcumin, resveratrol, and probiotics, have shown promising
effects in reducing the risk and progression of these diseases. Their mechanisms of
action often involve modulating inflammatory pathways, improving oxidative stress
management, enhancing immune function, and promoting cellular health (Calder
2017; Eichelmann et al. 2016). By leveraging the power of nutraceuticals, healthcare professionals can optimise health outcomes and empower individuals to take
control of their well-being through informed dietary choices and targeted

interventions. This book chapter examines the role of macronutrients and micronutrients in supporting optimal physiological functioning and their potential as nutraceutical agents. Also, it explores the interplay between nutraceuticals and
physiological processes, highlighting the potential of nutraceuticals in the prevention and management of chronic diseases.
###### **2 Macronutrients: Fuelling the Body’s Functions**

Macronutrients, comprising carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, serve as the primary
sources of energy and play vital roles in fuelling the body’s functions. Understanding
their impact on physiology is crucial for developing effective nutraceutical interventions in preventive medicine. Carbohydrates, the body’s primary energy source, are
broken down into glucose and utilised by cells for energy production (Astrup et al.
2020). Additionally, carbohydrates contribute to synthesising glycogen, the storage
form of glucose in the liver and muscles. Nutraceuticals derived from carbohydrates
(dietary fibres, prebiotics, and resistant starches) have been linked to various health
benefits, including improved glycemic control, weight management, and enhanced
gut health (Crichton and Bryan 2015). Furthermore, proteins, composed of amino
acids, are critical for the growth, repair, and maintenance of body tissues. They play
vital roles in enzymatic reactions, immune function, hormone production, and
transportation of molecules within the body (Bianchi and Gutierrez 2019). Dietary
protein intake is essential for preserving muscle mass, healing wounds, and optimising immune responses (Schwingshackl et al. 2021). Nutraceuticals derived from
proteins (whey protein, specific amino acids or protein isolates) have been studied
for their potential to promote muscle protein synthesis, enhance athletic performance, and support healthy ageing (Myles 2014). Additionally, fats, often demonized in the past, are essential for various physiological functions. They serve as a
concentrated energy source and aid in absorbing fat-soluble vitamins. They have a
significant role in maintaining the structure and function of cell membranes, hormone synthesis, and inflammation regulation. The balance between fats (saturated,
monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids) is essential for maintaining cardiovascular health and preventing chronic diseases (Rezende et al. 2014; Calder
2015). Nutraceuticals derived from fats (omega-3 fatty acids) have shown promising effects in reducing inflammation, improving lipid profiles, and supporting cognitive function (Table 2.1). **3 Micronutrients: Catalysts for Cellular Processes**

Micronutrients, including vitamins and minerals, act as catalysts for numerous cellular processes and have significance as potential nutraceutical agents in preventive
medicine. Vitamins are organic compounds that act as coenzymes or cofactors,

facilitating enzymatic reactions in energy production, DNA synthesis, immune
function, and antioxidant defence (De la Fuente et al. 2017). They are classified as
either water-soluble (such as vitamin C and the B vitamins) or fat-soluble (such as
vitamins A, D, E, and K). And nutraceuticals derived from both categories of vitamins have gained significant attention for their potential to promote health and prevent diseases (e.g., vitamin D has been studied for its role in bone health, immune
function, and cancer prevention, while vitamin C is recognised for its antioxidant
properties and support of collagen synthesis) (Fulgoni et al. 2011; Molfino et al.
2013). Likewise, minerals are inorganic elements essential for various physiological
processes and serve as structural components, cofactors for enzymatic reactions,
and regulators of cellular functions. Minerals (calcium, phosphorus, magnesium,
and potassium) are vital for maintaining bone health, nerve function, muscle contraction, and fluid balance. Trace minerals (iron, zinc, copper, selenium, and iodine)
are required in smaller amounts but play critical roles in immune function, energy
metabolism, and antioxidant defence (Farag et al. 2023) (Table 2.2).

Nutraceuticals derived from minerals have shown potential in preventing deficiencies and optimising cellular processes. (Iron supplementation: treat iron-­
deficiency anaemia, zinc: enhanced immune function and wound healing)
(Table 2.2). B vitamins and minerals are involved in energy metabolism, acting as
cofactors for enzymes in critical metabolic pathways, including carbohydrate, protein, and lipid metabolism (Tardy et al. 2020). They also play a significant role in
gene expression, supporting DNA synthesis, repair, and transcription. Furthermore,
micronutrients contribute to antioxidant defence, helping to neutralise free radicals
and protect cells from oxidative damage. Additionally, nutraceuticals derived from
micronutrients, such as antioxidant supplements, have been investigated for their
potential to reduce the risk of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases,
cancer, and age-related macular degeneration (Suzuki and Kunisawa 2015).

Phytonutrients, or phytochemicals, are natural compounds found in plants and are
antioxidant powerhouses. They encompass various compounds, including flavonoids, carotenoids, phenolic acids, and other plant-derived substances. These compounds are responsible for the vibrant colours, flavours, and aromas of fruits,
vegetables, herbs, and spices (Zhang et al. 2015). Beyond their sensory attributes,
phytonutrients exhibit remarkable antioxidant properties, protecting our cells from
oxidative damage caused by free radicals (Rudrapal et al. 2022). Oxidative stress, a
condition characterised by an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in
the body, has been linked to various chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and ageing-related conditions.
Phytonutrients act as potent antioxidants, neutralising free radicals and reducing
oxidative stress (Pizzino et al. 2017). They also support the body’s endogenous
antioxidant defence system, enhancing its ability to combat oxidative damage.

Some phytonutrients directly scavenge free radicals, preventing them from damaging cellular components such as DNA, proteins, and lipids. Others stimulate the
body’s antioxidant enzyme systems, enhancing the production of endogenous antioxidants like glutathione and superoxide dismutase (as listed in Table 2.3).
Additionally, phytonutrients may have anti-inflammatory effects, contributing to
their overall health benefits (Lobo et al. 2010; Sharifi-Rad et al. 2020). They have
gained significant attention in preventive medicine due to their potential to reduce
the risk of chronic diseases and ensure a broader range of health benefits. A diverse
and colourful plant-based diet is essential for obtaining many phytonutrients.
Different fruits, vegetables, herbs, and spices contain unique phytonutrient profiles
and consume various plant-based foods. Nutraceuticals derived from phytonutrients, such as supplements or concentrated extracts, have become a convenient way
to obtain specific phytonutrients with targeted health benefits (Nasri et al. 2014;
Puri et al. 2022).

###### **5 Fiber: Promoting Gut Health**

Fibre is crucial in maintaining a healthy diet and fostering optimal gut health. It
actively governs the microbiome’s composition, diversity, and richness, serving as
a valuable source of substrates for fermentation reactions. These reactions are conducted by specific microorganisms that possess the enzymatic tools required to
degrade the intricate carbohydrates found in fibre (Cronin et al. 2021). The recommended daily fibre intake for adult men is approximately 36 grams, while for
women, it is around 28 grams (Anderson et al. 2009). Fibre-rich foods, including
nuts, whole-grain flour, fruits, and vegetables, have been linked to several health
benefits. These benefits encompass reduced levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol, decreased insulin demand, increased stool bulk, softer faecal contents,
improved laxative properties, and a positive impact on body weight regulation.
Moreover, fibre has been associated with an increase in the production of short-­
chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolites in the gut of mice. This increase in SCFA production is accompanied by an elevation in butyrate receptor levels and a significant
reduction in polyposis (Bishehsari et al. 2018). A high dietary fibre intake has been
consistently linked to significantly lower prevalence rates of coronary heart disease
(CHD), stroke, and peripheral vascular disease (Liu et al. 1999). Higher consumption of whole grains is associated with a substantial 26% decrease in the prevalence
of ischemic strokes. Specifically, data from four studies involving over 134,000
individuals demonstrate that individuals in the highest quintile of dietary fibre or


-----

2 Foundation of Nutraceuticals in Preventive Medicine


27


whole grain intake have a relative risk of stroke of 0.74 compared to those in the
lowest quintile. This indicates a significantly lower risk of stroke for individuals
with higher intakes of dietary fibre or whole grains (Steffen et al. 2003).
###### ***5.1 Soluble Fiber***

Soluble fibre is a type of fibre that can dissolve in water and form a gel-like substance in the digestive tract. It is commonly found in oats, barley, legumes, fruits,
and vegetables. When consumed, soluble fibre absorbs water and undergoes fermentation in the colon. Soluble fibre can be categorised into viscous (gel-forming)
and non-viscous. Viscosity, in the context of dietary fibre, refers to the ability of
specific polysaccharides to thicken or form gels when mixed with fluids. This occurs
due to physical entanglements among the polysaccharide constituents within the
solution. Soluble non-viscous fibres, such as inulin and wheat dextrin, are rapidly
and completely fermented in the gut. As a result, they have the potential to produce
significant amounts of gas. On the other hand, soluble viscous fibres, like psyllium,
and insoluble fibres, such as wheat bran, are relatively less fermentable, leading to
lower production of gas (Chutkan et al. 2012). ***5.2 Insoluble Fiber***

Unlike soluble fibre, insoluble fibre does not dissolve in water but adds bulk to the
stool. It is commonly found in whole grains, nuts, seeds, and the skin of fruits and
vegetables. Insoluble fibre promotes regular bowel movements by increasing stool
volume and facilitating passage through the intestines. Examples of insoluble fibre-­
rich foods include wheat and rice (Baky et al. 2022). ***5.3 Prebiotic Fiber: Nourishing the Gut Microbiome***

Prebiotic dietary fibres are specific types of compounds that have a significant
impact on shaping the microbiota. They serve as a carbon source, promoting beneficial bacterial growth and inducing specific microbiome changes that contribute to
the host’s overall health and metabolism. Due to the numerous health benefits of
these bacterial genera, they are often used as indicators of microbiota health and
targeted for dietary interventions. Lactobacilli, for example, have been found to
decrease mucosal inflammation in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. They also assist in
the digestion of lactose for lactose-intolerant individuals, alleviate constipation,
improve symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and potentially help prevent
traveller diarrhoea. On the other hand, *Bifidobacteria* naturally inhabit the GI tract

of healthy adults and possess a solid capacity to ferment specific oligosaccharides.
This characteristic makes them a standard marker for evaluating prebiotic potential
and effectiveness (Carlson et al. 2018; Slavin 2013) (Fig. 2.1).
###### **6 Hydration and Cellular Function**

To maintain a proper water and mineral balance, the body relies on a complex system involving detectors located throughout various sites in the body. These detectors are interconnected through neural pathways and communicate with integrative
centres in the brain that process this information. These centres also respond to
humoral factors, known as neurohormones, which regulate diuresis, natriuresis, and
blood pressure. Such neurohormones include angiotensin, mineralocorticoids,


-----

2 Foundation of Nutraceuticals in Preventive Medicine


29


vasopressin, and atrial natriuretic factor. In the case of water deficit, the extracellular compartment experiences an increase in ionic concentration, leading to water
movement from the intracellular compartment and causing cells to shrink. Two
types of brain sensors detect this shrinkage—one controlling drinking behaviour
and the other regulating urine excretion. These sensors send signals to the kidneys,
primarily by releasing the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin, producing a smaller
volume of more concentrated urine. Conversely, when the body has an excess of
water, the reverse processes take place. The lower ionic concentration in body fluids
allows more water to enter the intracellular compartment. This leads to cell hydration, inhibiting the sensation of thirst, and prompts the kidneys to excrete more
water (Popkin et al. 2010; Lorenzo et al. 2019).

Additionally, there is a link between exercise-related asthma and low fluid intake,
which can contribute to bronchopulmonary disorders. Insufficient fluid intake during exercise can lead to dehydration, harming the airways and respiratory system.
Dehydration can make the airways more sensitive and prone to irritation, increasing
the risk of bronchospasm and exacerbating asthma symptoms during physical exertion. Individuals with exercise-related asthma need to maintain proper hydration by
consuming adequate fluids before, during, and after exercise to help mitigate the
potential impact on bronchopulmonary health (Kalhoff 2003).
###### **7 Nutrient Absorption and Metabolism**

Nutrient absorption is a vital process through which the body obtains essential macronutrients, micronutrients, and other necessary components from our food. This
intricate process primarily occurs in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, with the small
intestine being the leading site for nutrient absorption. On the other hand, the colon
mainly handles the transport of water and electrolytes (Physiology n.d.). In the
small intestine, three main mechanisms contribute to the transport of sodium ions
(Na+) across the apical membrane: (a) Nutrient-coupled Na + absorption: This
mechanism involves the participation of various families of Na + -dependent nutrient transporters. For example, specific transporters for sugars and amino acids play
a crucial role in absorbing these nutrients. (b) Electroneutral NaCl absorption: This
process primarily occurs through the Na+/H+ exchange mechanism. It involves the
exchange of Na + and H+ ions, resulting in the absorption of both sodium and chloride ions. (c) Electrogenic Na + absorption in the colon: This mechanism is predominantly found in the colon and involves the activity of epithelial Na + channels
(ENaC), which facilitate the electrogenic absorption of sodium ions. These mechanisms collectively contribute to the efficient absorption of nutrients, maintaining
electrolyte balance, and water transport throughout the GI tract (Feranchak 2003;
Rajendran et al. 2018).

Efficient chloride absorption in the gut results in an average stool concentration
of 10–15 millimoles per litre (mmol/L). However, in malabsorption conditions,


-----

30


P. Pancham et al.


such as congenital chloride diarrhoea, the chloride concentration in the stool can
exceed 90 mmol/L. Chloride is absorbed from the intestinal lumen through three
distinct mechanisms: (a) Paracellular (passive) pathway: Chloride can passively
move between cells through the space between them, known as the paracellular
pathway. (b) Electroneutral pathways: These pathways involve coupled transport of
sodium (Na+) and hydrogen ions (H+) with chloride ions (Cl-) exchange. The
movement of Na + and H+ ions drives the absorption of chloride. (c) Protein-­
dependent chloride absorption: Certain intestinal epithelium proteins facilitate chloride ions’ active transport (Said et al. 2000). Water-soluble vitamins are essential for
average growth and development as they participate in various metabolic processes.
Unlike fat-soluble vitamins, humans cannot synthesise many water-soluble vitamins and must rely on their intake from external sources. An adequate supply of
water-soluble vitamins through a balanced diet is essential to meet the body’s
requirements (Biochemistry n.d.).

Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin that humans
cannot synthesise and must obtain from dietary sources. Its intestinal transport
occurs through a carrier-mediated mechanism dependent on sodium ions (Na+).
There are two known Na + -dependent carriers for vitamin C in humans: vitamin C
transporter-1 (SVCT1) and SVCT2, encoded by the SLC23A1 and SLC23A2 genes.
Biotin, another water-soluble vitamin, can be obtained from two sources in the
human intestine: dietary sources and bacterial production. Biotin is absorbed
through a carrier-mediated process dependent on sodium ions (Na+). The intestinal
sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT), encoded by the SLC5A6
gene, is responsible for biotin uptake throughout the intestinal tract (Padayatty and
Levine 2016).

Cobalamin, or vitamin B12, is obtained from animal-derived foods and can be
produced by the colonic microbiota. Dietary cobalamin binds to the protein haptocorrin (transcobalamin-1; TC1) in the stomach. Trypsin releases cobalamin from
the TC1 complex in the small intestine, binding to gastric intrinsic factor (GIF). The
B12/GIF complex binds to the multi-ligand heterodimeric receptor called cubam,
composed of amnionless (AMN) and cubilin (CUBL), located at the apical membrane of ileal enterocytes. After internalisation, the complex undergoes recycling,
and cobalamin is transported out of the enterocytes by the multi-drug resistant associated protein-1 (MRP1) at the basolateral membrane. Systemically, transcobalamin
carries cobalamin for utilisation and storage (Kiela and Ghishan 2016). The intestinal transport of vitamin B2 (riboflavin) is believed to occur through riboflavin transporters known as RFVT1 and RFVT2, encoded by the SLC52A1 and SLC52A2
genes, respectively.

Thiamin, also known as vitamin B1, is widely available in dietary sources such
as whole grains, nuts, and dried legumes. Intestinal absorption of thiamin is attributed to two thiamin transporters in humans: THTR1 and THTR2, encoded by the
SLC19A2 and SLC19A3 genes, respectively. These transporters are expressed
throughout the gastrointestinal tract (Mosegaard et al. 2020). Vitamin A, a fat-­
soluble vitamin, exists in the diet as retinol or ethyl esters (preformed) and as


-----

**Fig. 2.2** Illustration showing the different mechanisms of nutrients absorption in GI tract


31


pro-vitamin A carotenoids. The absorption of vitamin A in the intestines depends on
its dietary form. Pro-vitamin A carotenoids are converted to retinol within enterocytes. As a fat-soluble vitamin, retinol and retinol esters are re-esterified before
incorporation into chylomicrons with other lipids. Chylomicrons enter the circulation via the lymphatics and are taken up by hepatocytes through apolipoprotein
E-dependent internalisation. Within hepatocytes, retinol esters are stored primarily
in the form of palmitate. Retinol-binding proteins transport vitamin A from the liver
to peripheral tissues (Reboul 2013) (Fig. 2.2).

Vitamin D has two major forms: vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D3
(cholecalciferol). Vitamin D3 is synthesised in the skin upon exposure to ultraviolet
B (UVB) radiation. Pre-vitamin D3 is then converted to cholecalciferol, which is
transported to the liver bound to a binding protein. In the liver, both vitamin D2 and
D3 undergo hydroxylation to form 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Subsequently, in the kidneys, 1α-hydroxylation occurs to produce the biologically active form of vitamin D,
known as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or calcitriol. Vitamin D is involved in the regulation of intestinal absorption of calcium (Ca [2+] ) and phosphate (Pi) and their reabsorption in the kidneys (Ross 2011). Vitamin E encompasses a group of compounds
known as tocopherols and tocotrienols. The main biological activity is attributed to
α-tocopherol, predominant in most foods. Vitamin E is a lipid-soluble antioxidant,
protecting cells from reactive oxygen species generated during lipid oxidation.
Vitamin K1 is converted to vitamin K2 (menaquinones) by intestinal bacteria or can
be synthesised de novo. Vitamin K2 is the primary storage form of vitamin
K. Absorption of vitamin K occurs through the lipid pathway in the terminal ileum
and is dependent on biliary and pancreatic enzymes. The level of gamma-­
carboxylated proteins in the blood indirectly measures vitamin K status (Szewczyk
et al. 2021).

###### **8 Nutrient Excesses: Optimal Intake and Toxicity**


P. Pancham et al.


The requirement for each nutrient lies within a safe and desirable range, exceeding
which poses a risk of adverse health effects. Consumption of any nutrient, including
water, in excessive amounts can lead to toxicity, depending on the dosage. Overdoses
of certain nutrients, such as iron and vitamin A, can result in poisoning, acute toxicity, and even death in severe cases. The recommended daily intake for various nutrients is as follows: Calcium – 2500 mg, Copper – 10 mg, Fluoride – 10 mg, Folic
acid – 1000 μg, Iodine – 1100 μg, Iron – 45 mg, Magnesium – 350 mg, Manganese –
11 mg, Niacin – 35 mg, Phosphorus – 4 grams, Selenium – 400 μg, Vitamin A –
3000 μg (equivalent to 10,000 IU), Vitamin B6–100 mg, Vitamin C – 2000 mg,
Vitamin D – 50 μg (equivalent to 2000 IU), Vitamin E – 1000 mg, and Zinc – 40 mg
(Saylor and Probasco 2017).
###### **9 Nutraceuticals and Nutrient Synergy**

Food contains essential nutrients with specific active compounds with functional
properties that can help prevent diseases. The immune system, which consists of
various tissues, cells, organs, proteins, and chemicals, plays a crucial role in protecting the body. Therefore, the immune system’s effectiveness can be seen as an indicator of proper nutrition (Natarajan et al. 2019). Garlic and honey exhibit a beneficial
synergistic effect. When garlic is ingested and reaches the stomach, it stimulates the
production of gastric juices, which play a vital role in iron absorption and enhance
the circulation of nutrients in the bloodstream (Shoba et al. 1998). Almond skin,
rich in flavonoids, provides significant health benefits and works synergistically
with vitamin C and vitamin E to protect against the oxidation of LDL (low-density
lipoprotein) (Chen et al. 2005). The salads containing tomatoes, carrots, and green
leafy vegetables provide carotenoids such as lycopene, lutein, beta-carotene, alpha-­
carotene, and zeaxanthin. Additionally, egg yolks also contain zeaxanthin and
lutein. Consuming boiled eggs together with the salad has been shown to significantly increase the absorption of carotenoids, ranging from 3 to 9 times higher than
consuming the salad alone (Cook and Briggs 1986).

Lemon and green leafy vegetables are beneficial in addressing iron deficiency
anaemia by increasing haemoglobin levels. They help improve the bioavailability of
iron in the bloodstream. This is achieved through ascorbic acid or vitamin C, which
enhances the absorption of non-heme iron from the diet. Vitamin C first converts
ferric iron into a non-absorbable form and then facilitates its conversion back to fer
rous iron, which is more easily absorbed by the mucosal cells, leading to better iron
absorption (Lynch and Cook 1980). Yoghurt and bananas synergise, providing
mutual benefits through probiotics and prebiotics. Probiotics introduce beneficial
bacteria into the gut, while prebiotics serve as a source of nourishment for these
good bacteria. The gut bacteria are supported and encouraged to thrive by


-----

33


consuming probiotics and prebiotics, improving gastrointestinal digestion and overall gut health (Krisnanda 2019).

Bananas contain inulin, a prebiotic fibre that is a fuel source for growing beneficial bacteria in yoghurt. This symbiotic relationship between inulin and probiotics
supports the improvement of immune function and regulation of digestion.
Additionally, when combined with probiotics, inulin helps to enhance the absorption and utilisation of calcium in the body, leading to increased levels of this essential mineral (Fernandez and Marette 2017).
###### **10 Complementary Nutrients: Enhancing Bioavailability**

Using complementary nutrient-rich whole food sources to address micronutrient
and calorie malnutrition has gained significant attention. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of lentils and kale as complementary food sources to combat
global malnutrition and calorie-related issues. These foods provide a diverse range
of essential nutrients and offer the opportunity for further enrichment through prebiotic carbohydrates and genetic advancements. By exploring the carbohydrate profiles and genetic potential of lentils and kale, we can work towards developing
sustainable and nutritious food systems that contribute to addressing the global
challenge of malnutrition (Migliozzi et al. 2015).

A separate study focused on the potential of fortifying maise/soybean and peanut
with *Moringa oleifera* leaf powder to create protein-rich complementary food products. This fortification approach enhanced nutrient quantity, quality, and availability
in the fortified products. Specifically, feeding studies conducted with rats demonstrated improved protein quality indices, indicating the enhanced nutritional value
of the fortified foods. This suggests that incorporating Moringa oleifera leaf powder
into these food products can contribute to developing acceptable and nutritionally
improved complementary foods (Shiriki et al. 2015). **11 Nutrient Interactions: Synergistic Effects**

The relationship between infection and malnutrition has long been recognised as
synergistic. While extensive research exists on the role of individual nutrients in
immune function, the understanding of multiple nutrients and their interactions is
less explored. The availability of one nutrient can influence the action of another
nutrient in the immune system, as observed with vitamin E and selenium, vitamin E
and vitamin A, zinc and copper, and dietary fatty acids and vitamin A. These
nutrient-­nutrient interactions can hurt immune function (Scrimshaw and
SanGiovanni 1997).

The association between vitamin E and selenium was among the first reported
interactions in mammalian metabolism. Schwarz and Foltz discovered that small


-----

34


P. Pancham et al.


amounts of selenium could prevent liver necrosis in rats deficient in vitamin E. This
finding began a relationship between these two nutrients and sparked a further
investigation into their interconnected roles (Kubena and McMurray 1996a).
Another notable example of an interaction involving vitamin E is its relationship
with vitamin C. An in vitro study demonstrated a synergistic effect of supplemental
vitamins E and C on the inhibition of the release of arachidonic acid. This suggests
that when combined, these two vitamins may significantly impact specific biochemical processes more than when consumed individually (ElAttar and Lin 1992).

Several studies have noted an antagonistic effect between vitamins E and
A. While both vitamin E and A supplements were found to increase antibody production and phagocytosis, it was observed that when either one was increased,
immune function was less pronounced. This effect may be attributed to the suppression of gastrointestinal absorption and tissue reserves of vitamin E caused by high
vitamin A levels. The interaction between these two vitamins highlights the importance of maintaining a balance in their intake for optimal immune function (Tengerdy
and Nockels 1975; Tengerdy and Brown 1977; Pudelkiewicz et al. 1964).

Vitamin A and vitamin D are both essential for optimal immune responses.
Vitamin A or retinol deficiency can impair mitogen-induced proliferation in rats,
reduce antibody responses to pneumococcal polysaccharides, and decrease natural
killer (NK) cell and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) activity in rats. Moreover, vitamin A
deficiency has been associated with impaired resistance to infectious diseases in
rodents and chickens. These findings highlight the importance of adequate vitamin
A and vitamin D intake for maintaining a robust immune system and effective
defence against infections (Kubena and McMurray 1996b).
###### **12 Nutrient Requirements Across the Lifespan**

During pregnancy, the energy and nutrient demands of the body increase significantly. The total energy cost of pregnancy is estimated to be around 80,000 kcal,
which translates to an average daily requirement of 2500 kcal for women in the
second and third trimester, or an additional 200–500 kcal per day, depending on
their activity level. According to the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) recommendations, pregnant women are advised to consume an extra 340 kcal during the second
and 452 kcal during the third trimester. Additionally, they should aim for approximately 130 grams of carbohydrates per day and about 1.1 grams of protein per
kilogram of body weight per day. The need for iron also significantly increases during pregnancy, nearly doubling to 18 to 27 mg per day. This is due to the 50%
increase in the mother’s blood volume. Adequate intake of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is crucial for fetal brain
growth and visual development. It is recommended that pregnant women consume
300 mg of DHA per day. For lactating mothers, the energy requirement further
increases. They are estimated to need about 640 additional kcal per day to support
breast milk production. This ensures an adequate supply of nutrients for both the


-----

35


mother and the baby during breastfeeding (Ilich and Brownbill 2009; Nutrition during lactation 1996).

A woman’s energy requirements increase during lactation to support breast milk
production. Per the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI), the current recommendation
suggests an additional 330 kcal/day intake for the first 6 months and 400 kcal/day
for the second 6 months. This gradual increase allows for a healthy weight loss during lactation. For protein, the DRI recommends 13 grams per day for children
between the ages of 1 and 3, and it increases to 19 grams per day for children aged
4 to 8. The DRI for carbohydrates remains constant at 130 grams daily for children
of all ages. The recommended intake of fat should be 25–35% of the total energy
intake for children between the ages of 4 and 18. Calcium is vital for children’s
growth, and the DRI suggests that children between the ages of 1 and 3 should consume 1–2 servings of dairy per day to meet the calcium requirement of 500 mg/day.
For children between the ages of 4 and 8, 2–3 servings of dairy are recommended to
meet the calcium requirement of 800 mg/day (Nutrition during Pregnancy and
Lactation 2020).

Significant growth occurs during adolescence (8–17), with about 20% of adult
height and 50% of adult weight gained. The DRI recommendations are divided into
two age groups: 9–13 and 14–18. Both males and females in these age groups are
advised to consume 56 grams and 46 grams of protein daily (Ilich and Brownbill
2009; Soliman et al. 2014). The DRI recommendations are divided into three age
categories for adults: 19–30, 31–50, and over 50. The estimated energy requirements are 2403 kcal for females and 3067 kcal for males in all three age categories,
with slight calorie reductions for each year above 19. The recommended protein
intake for males and females aged 19 and over is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body
weight per day. In older adults, the nutrient requirements change. For males over
50 years, the DRI for vitamin B6 increases to 1.7 mg/day, while for females over
50 years, it increases to 1.5 mg/day. The calcium requirement increases to 1200 mg/
day for adults over 50 years. The iron requirement decreases to 8 mg/day for females
over 50 years. Chromium and vitamin D requirements also change with age (Ilich
and Brownbill 2009; National Research Council (US) 1989).

It’s important to note that these recommendations provide a general guideline,
and individual needs may vary based on factors such as activity level, health status,
and specific nutritional requirements. Consulting with a healthcare professional or
registered dietitian can provide personalised recommendations based on individual
circumstances.

##### **Chapter 3**
#### **Nutraceuticals in Metabolism ** **and Xenobiotics**

**Hussaina Banu Buhari Malkhan Ali**
###### **1 Introduction** ***1.1 Xenobiotics***

Xenobiotics are toxic chemical substances from exogenous sources, such as pesticides, food additives, pollutants, pharmaceutical drugs, cosmeceuticals and carcinogens, that enters the body through the food eaten, air breathed in or exposure to
toxic chemicals through the skin to reach the blood stream resulting in toxicity and
harmful effects. Certain xenobiotics are toxic in their parental form or as their
metabolite when acted upon by the metabolizing enzymes of the body (Zhao
et al. 2021). ***1.2 Fate of Xenobiotics & Endogenous Substrates***

Most of the xenobiotics are lipophilic in their chemical nature with better solubility
in lipids or fats than in aqueous solutions, which limits their absorption and may
accumulate in adipose tissues and the phospholipids of the cell, wherein the accumulated toxic chemical can have a harmful effect at the site of exposure or at the site
of its distribution. However, there are a number of drug or xenobiotic metabolizing
enzymes involved in the prevention of bioaccumulation of toxic chemicals in the
tissues by mediating the biotransformation of lipophilic xenobiotics to more polar
or water-soluble substrates that can be further metabolized into a suitable form that

can be readily eliminated by the body (Hrubý and Anzenbacher 1997; Amacher 2010).

###### ***1.3 Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism *** ***and Excretion (ADME)***


H. B. B. M. Ali


Although, the metabolism of most of the toxic chemicals is mediated by the combined action of both phase I and phase II metabolizing enzymes leading to the
detoxication of the exogenous substrate, the biotransformation can be mainly mediated by the Phase I enzymes. They play a potential role in the biotransformation of
the lipophilic xenobiotic into a more water soluble form by introducing certain polar
groups to form a reactive site that helps in the accessibility by the phase II enzymes,
which facilitates the elimination or excretion of the toxic chemicals by subjecting
the hydrophilic toxic chemicals to various chemical reactions such as conjugation
(Rendic and Guengerich 2014). The drug uptake transporters remove the toxic
chemicals from the blood by mediating their uptake in liver and kidney; and the
drug efflux transporters mediate the excretion of the metabolite into the bile and/or
the urine (Yaqoob et al. 2022).

**1.3.1 Phase I Metabolism**

Phase I metabolizing enzymes are primarily associated with the functionalization of
toxic compounds, mainly through the oxidation, reduction and hydrolysis reactions,
which introduces the polar functional groups to the toxic chemicals, rendering them
hydrophilic in nature. Phase I enzymes are the first line of defence by the body,
where a broad spectrum of toxic lipophilic substrates including the xenobiotics,
hormones, steroids or pharmaceutical drugs are introduced with polar moieties such
as hydroxyl (-OH), carboxyl (-COOH) or amino (-NH 2 ) to form a reactive hydrophilic site for the phase II metabolising enzymes.

Phase I enzymes mainly encompass the cytochrome P450s superfamily of mono-­
oxygenases, which are predominant players of xenobiotic metabolism. The CYP-­
P450 isoforms are heme containing enzymatic proteins catalysing the oxidative
reactions such as S-oxidation, N-oxidation, C-H bond hydroxylation, epoxidation,
N-dealkylation, N-hydroxylation, and O-dealkylation (Anzenbacher and
Anzenbacherová 2001; Hodges and Minich 2015; Wiśniewska and Mazerska 2009).
Other phase I metabolizing enzymes include xanthine oxidases, flavin monooxygenases, alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases, and monoamine oxidases.

In humans, there are about 57 cytochrome isoforms identified, mainly distributed
in the liver and intestinal tissues. Among the large family of cytochrome P450
enzymes, only a few of the enzymes belonging to the CYP1, 2 & 3 families are
found to be the most abundant isozyme involved in the metabolism of a wide range
of exogenous and endogenous substrates in the liver and intestine (Monostory and
Vereczkey 1995; Pang et al. 2021).

The most common cytochromes are the membrane bound enzymes in the liver
cell endoplasmic reticulum, which includes CYP3A4 (most common), CYP2C9,
CYP2C8, CYP2E1 and CYP1A2; whereas the CYP3A5, CYP2A6, CYP2B6,

43


CYP2D6, and CYP2C19 are the less common forms; and the enzymes CYP2J2,
CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 are the most common extra hepatic cytochrome isoforms in
tissues such as lung, kidney, intestine, skin and adipose tissue (Zanger and
Schwab 2013).

**1.3.2 Phase II Metabolism**

Phase II metabolism involves the conjugation reactions followed by the phase I
chemical reactions that generate the reactive intermediates with hydrophilic reactive
site readily available for the phase II metabolizing enzymes to further conjugate an
endogenous hydrophilic substrate making it suitable for enhanced excretion in urine
and/or bile. Several metabolic products of the Phase I enzymes, which are water
soluble intermediates but remain active and toxic, are acted upon easily by the phase
II enzymes that mainly intends to further increase the water solubility of the substrate by catalysing several conjugation reactions rendering the conversion of
endogenous and xenobiotic toxic chemicals into water soluble inactive substances
followed by the elimination from the body through the urine or bile (Sevior
et al. 2012).

The most common endogenous substrates for the conjugation are the glutathione, glucuronic acid, methyl groups and sulphates that makes the metabolite readily
excretable. The key enzymes of the phase II metabolism are glutathione S-transferase
(GST), UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT), sulfotransferases, N-acetyl transferases (NAT), acyl transferase and methyl transferase that uses glutathione, glucuronic acid, sulphate, acetyl co-enzyme A, acyl co-enzyme A, S-adenosyl methionine
as conjugating agents (Almazroo et al. 2017; Meyer 1996).

The endogenous or exogenous substrates that already have the polar functional
groups such as -OH, -NH 2 or COOH groups, have the innate potential to bypass the
phase I metabolism and directly become hydrophilic substrates for the phase II
metabolism and can be subjected to the conjugation reactions for elimination
through urine or bile (Phang-Lyn and Llerena 2020).

Inadequacy of expression of phase II metabolism results in intracellular oxidative damage resulting in inflammation and carcinogenesis. The expression of the
phase II metabolizing enzymes GST and UGT, in particular GSTM1, GSTA1,
GSTP1, UGT1A8 and UGT1A10, are found to be associated with the detoxification
of various carcinogens.

**1.3.3 Drug Uptake and Efflux Transporters**

Besides the metabolizing enzymes, the uptake and efflux transporters of drugs play
a significant role in the elimination of the toxic chemicals from the body. Most of
the toxic metabolites or the reactive intermediates have differing water solubility or
charges cannot freely cross the phospholipid membrane of cells; and hence the
interplay between the drug transporters across the organs greatly influences the


-----

H. B. B. M. Ali


mobility of the metabolites across the blood, liver, intestine and kidneys, mediating
detoxification reactions.

The drug uptake transporters, that are mainly in the liver and the kidney, remove
the toxic chemicals from the blood by increasing the absorption of the toxic chemicals in the intestinal lumen; and the drug efflux transporters mediate the pumping of
the processed toxic metabolite into the bile or the urine for excretion. The transporter proteins mainly belong to the super families of ABC (ATP binding cassette)
and SLC (solute carrier), which are involved in mediating the efflux and influx of
toxic chemicals in the cells (Takano et al. 2006). The ABC family includes seven
families of about 20 carrier proteins, which functions as ATP powered solute pumps;
and the SLC comprises 52 families of drug uptake transporters. Most of the transporter proteins are distributed in the liver tissue and extra-hepatic tissues such as
lung and kidneys (Döring and Petzinger 2014).

Drug uptake transporters include mainly the human organic anion uptake transporter proteins (OATP), including OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1 and Na [+]
(sodium ion) taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) in liver cells; and
OAT1, OAT3 and OAT4 in the kidney cells. These transport proteins are mainly
associated with the uptake of glucuronide and sulfate metabolites produced by the
phase II metabolizing enzymes. The drug efflux transporters include major transporter of organic ions (particularly MRP2 & MRP3), BCRP (Breast Cancer
Resistance Protein), BSEP (Bile Salt Export Pump), MATE (Multidrug Export
Transport Pump) and p-glycoprotein (Nakanishi and Tamai 2015; Patel et al. 2016).

**1.3.4 Transcription Factors**

The expression of phase I and phase II metabolism as well as the drug uptake and
efflux pumps are regulated by certain transcription factors such as Nrf2 (Nuclear
factor erythroid-2-related factor 2), hepatic nuclear factor 1, CCAAT-enhancer
binding protein-β, PPAR (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors), and PXR
(Pregnane X nuclear Receptors) and FXR (Farnesoid X Receptor). These transcription factors are activated in response to the xenobiotic intracellular oxidative stresses
and are primarily involved in the regulation of expression of drug-metabolizing
enzymes and drug transporters.

The activation of every single transcription factor is found to be associated with
a specific signalling pathway that regulates the modulation of transcription factors
through ligand-protein or protein-protein interactions in response to the oxidative
stress signals. For instance, the Nrf2 and Antioxidant responsive elements (ARE)
are widely responsible for the detoxification and excretion of several common xenobiotics that are found to be involved in the transactivation of phase II metabolizing
enzymes, particularly GST, heme oxygenases-1, UGT, NQO-1 and γ-glutamyl-­
cysteine synthetase and also various organic anion transporters.

AREs are specific DNA consensus sequence that are electrophile responsive elements in nature. They are the enhancer regions located in the promoter regions of
genes encoding the detoxification enzymes such as GST, NAD(P)H quinone

oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, gamma-glutamate cysteine ligase and hemeoxygenase-1, as well as some of the oxidative stress enzyme
genes rendering them protection against xenobiotics and other endogenous substrates that causes genotoxic damage to cells. The reactive oxygen species, which
are the oxidative stress inducers generated during metabolic reactions while processing toxic chemicals trigger the ARE regions resulting in the ARE-mediated chemoprotective gene expression (Pool-Zobel et al. 2005; Lee et al. 2009).

In response to the xenobiotic and oxidative stress, Nrf2 transcription factor dissociates from the bound cytoplasmic Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1),
allowing the translocation of Nrf2 to into the nucleus after phosporylation, wherein
Nrf2 binds with Maf protein to form a heterodimer triggering the ARE-mediated
chemoprotective gene expression of several detoxification and cytoprotective
enzymes (Nguyen et al. 2003; Rushmore et al. 1991).
###### **2 Nutraceuticals in Xenobiotic Metabolism**

Dietary nutrients play a critical role in the regulation of xenobiotic metabolizing
enzymes by altering their expression and function. The dietary nutrients mainly
include the polyphenolic compounds, alkaloids, organosulfur compounds, nitrogen
containing compounds, terpenoids, essential fatty acids and oils, vitamins, minerals,
and other protecting dietary agents such as bioactive peptides, butyrates and probiotics that plays a pivotal role in the metabolism and elimination of endogenous and
exogenous toxic substances. ***2.1 Role in Detoxification***

Previous studies on xenobiotic metabolism and its association with the intake of
dietary nutrients have made it evident that some of the nutritional deficiencies
results in deficiency of clearance of xenobiotics and endogenous substrates, leading
to the induction of tumor and cancer growth. In order to achieve chemoprevention,
the main role of the metabolizing enzyme is to target the detoxification and elimination of the pre-carcinogen rather than the active conversion of pre-carcinogen to
carcinogen to initiate the cancer growth. Studies have shown that there are several
nutraceutical agents that play a critical role in the elimination of toxins by inducing
the phase I enzymes to metabolize the toxic substrate facilitating the xenobiotic
clearance from the body.

Studies have shown that there are several nutraceutical agents that play a critical
role in the elimination of toxins by inducing the phase II enzymes that catalyzes the
various conjugation reactions forcing the xenobiotic to eliminate from the body.
Excessive activity of phase I enzymes like CYP1A superfamily without adequate
expression of the phase II enzymes might result in the progression of cancers due to


-----

the toxic procarcinogens. There are a number of studies available on the increased
expression of the phase II metabolizing enzymes by nutraceutical agents or antioxidants in animal studies rendering protection against cancer causing chemicals
(Pool-Zobel et al. 2005).

Researches show that several of the phenolic antioxidants and aromatic phytochemicals present in the food (e.g. beta-naphthoflavone and 3-methylcholanthrene)
have immense potential in the activation of transcription factors triggering the synthesis of phase II metabolizing enzymes that renders the elimination of toxic intermediates processed by phase I metabolizing enzymes (Rushmore et al. 1991).
###### ***2.2 Chemoprevention & Biotransformation of Xenobiotics***

During the phase I metabolism, several xenobiotics are converted into its soluble
metabolite, which are in most cases a reactive electrophilic species that has the
potential to induce oxidative stress in cells resulting in carcinogenic bio-activation.
The phase I enzymes have an immense interindividual variability in genetic expression; and many of the pro-carcinogenic chemicals formed in phase I enzymatic
reactions covalently or non-covalently attach to the DNA or RNA to initiate cancer
growth in cells. The excessive genetic expression and enzymatic activity of phase I
enzymes are associated with cancers, as they result in rapid formation of the highly
reactive intermediates in the cells without much stimulation of the phase II enzymes
(Paine 1981).

For instance, the genetic polymorphisms of the cytochrome P450 family 1, which
constitutes mainly CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B1, have been frequently associated with drug resistance, and the process of initiation and progression of cancer.
The CYP1A family is mainly involved in the detoxification of common and complex chemical substrates such as poly aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), heterocyclic
amines and polychlorinated biphenyls. Increased expression of the CYP1 enzymes
have been associated with cancers due to their potential to bio-transform toxic pro-­
carcinogens to carcinogens having reactive electrophilic groups that forms carcinogenic DNA adducts leading to cancer progression (Božina et al. 2009). ***2.3 Nutraceuticals as Bifunctional Modulators***

Nutraceuticals play a vital role in the chemoprevention or protection against the
induction of cancers by various carcinogenic agents mediated by the inhibition of
phase I enzymes involved in the oxidation of xenobiotics into several carcinogenic
substrates that forms DNA adducts triggering the carcinogenesis process (Reed
et al. 2018). Genetic variability in the enzymes of the phase I metabolism is


-----

associated with both the induction and inhibition of cancers. CYP3A4 has been

found to be downregulated in colorectal tissue of patients in various stages of
colorectal cancers, whereas the expression of CYP2C9 was higher in colon and
rectal cancer patients in comparison with the healthy mucosal tissues (Beyerle et al.
2020; Mansoor et al. 2023; Pool-zobel et al. 2005).

Excessive expression of the enzymes of phase I metabolism with lesser support
from the phase II detoxification system leads to carcinogenesis due to the rapid
metabolism of xenobiotics to carcinogenic DNA adducts paving way to genotoxicity. Hence, the rate of phase I metabolism is limited and the elimination by the phase
II metabolism is favored by the body. Thus, the nutraceuticals can selectively modulate the expression of the detoxification systems rendering the protection from intracellular oxidative stress induced by the xenobiotic.

Several nutraceuticals play an important role in increasing the bioavailability of
the drugs in the blood stream by inhibiting some of the cytochrome P450 enzyme
mediated drug uptake mechanism, for instance CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 isozymes,
mainly in the liver (Kimura et al. 2010a; Bailey et al. 1998). However, there are
some of the natural metabolites that inhibits certain cytochrome P450 expression in
the intestine and not in the liver, enhancing the bioavailability of the drug. Research
by Lown et al. (1997) have shown that the grape fruit juice inhibits the CYP3A
protein of intestine promoting the oral bioavailability of the anti-hypertensive drug
felodipine in healthy individuals.
###### **3 Phytochemicals in Diet** ***3.1 Bioactive Natural Products***

There are several classifications of phytonutrients present in the diet (Bellik et al.
2012; Martinez et al. 2017). The phytochemicals of the diet mainly include the
polyphenolic compounds, which fall under the category of flavonoid phenolic compounds (includes flavones, isoflavones, flavanones, anthocyanins, flavonols, and
flavan-3-ols); and the non-flavonoid phenolic compounds (includes coumarins, phenolic acids, lignans, stilbens, curcumin, garcinol and tannins). The phenolic compounds are aromatic compounds that possesses multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups and
are the bioactive moieties that exhibits multiple health benefits, particularly strong
antioxidants pertaining to their iron-chelating and free radical scavenging ability
(‌Surh YJ. 2003). The dietary nutrients also encompass vitamins, minerals, sterols,
bioactive peptides, essential fats and oils, alkaloids, organosulfur compounds, terpenoids and other protecting bioactive dietary agents such as butyrate from fermented plant product.

###### ***3.2 Flavonoid Polyphenols***

**3.2.1 Flavonols**


H. B. B. M. Ali


The flavonols have the 3-hydroxyflavone backbone, which are flavonoids with a
ketone group; and the class includes quercetin, quercetin-3O-glucuronide, naringenin, kaempferol, myricetin, rutin, and isorhamnetin. There have been several
researches on the pharmaceutical effectiveness of flavonols as antioxidants and are
found to have a strong influence on the biological activity of diverse enzymes in
detoxification.

Study by Warwick et al. (2012) on dietary inclusion of phytochemicals in infants
to understand their potential to induce phase II metabolism, rendering protection
from exposure to xenobiotics in later life. The phytochemicals sulforaphane, quercetin and catechin were screened for their efficacy and a significant induction of
mRNA of glutathione S-transferase A1 (GSTA1) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) was noticed. Among the tested phytochemicals, sulforaphane
exhibited a strong induction of the phase II metabolizing enzymes followed by catechin and then quercetin.

The polyphenolic compound in diet, particularly kaempferol from ginseng, quercetin, hypericin, allicin from garlic, silibinin from milk thistle, and hyperforin from
St. John’s wort, were tested in vitro for their efficacy to modulate the CYP3A4 and
p-glycoprotein. The Caco-2 cells grown with 1-alpha,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 and
multidrug-resistant 1 (MDR1) transfected MDCK cells was tested for the CYP3A4-­
mediated metabolism with cortisol; and through P-gp-mediated efflux of the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor ritonavir. The investigation
showed that the phytonutrients kaempferol, quercetin and hypericin, significantly
inhibited P-gp-mediated efflux of ritonavir in Caco-2 cells and also the CYP3A4
activity; allicin exhibited inhibition of the drug ritonavir efflux on MDR1-MDCK
cells, while hyperforin and silibinin did not influence the cellular uptake of the
metabolite. The phytonutrient hypericin inhibited reduced nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent metabolism of cortisol; and kaempferol and quercetin significantly inhibited cortisol metabolism (Patel et al. 2004).

The effect of the flavonol quercetin on the expression of N-acetyl transferase 2
(NAT2), CYP1A2, CYP2A6, and xanthine oxidase (XO) was tested in vivo in 12
humans and the results showed that quercetin inhibited CYP1A2, whereas it
enhances the effects of CYP2A6, NAT2 and XO (Chen et al. 2009). The effect of
quercetin on hepatic cytochrome P450 isozymes of rats had shown that the flavonoid quercetin was one of the most potent inducer of CYP2B isozyme and a less
potent inducer of CYP1A isozyme (Rahden-Staron et al. 2001). Valerio et al. (2001)
have studied the effect of quercetin on phase II detoxification by screening NQO1
activity in the human MCF-7 breast cancer cell line; and have reported a 2 fold and
3–4 fold increase in the protein and mRNA expression, respectively.

3 Nutraceuticals in Metabolism and Xenobiotics

**3.2.2 Flavan-3-ols**


49


The flavanols (flavan-3-ols), commonly referred to as catechins, include catechin,
epicatechin, epicatechin gallate, gallo-catechin, procyanidin, and benzotropolones.
The flavanols comprise the basic skeleton of a 2-phenyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-chromen3-­ol that has no double bonds between the second and third carbon, and has two

chiral carbons. There have been several studies done on catechins and its derivatives
that signifies the effectiveness of catechins in the phase I as well as phase II xenobiotic metabolism (Satoh et al. 2016; Srinivasan et al. 2008; Tan et al. 2010; Warwick
et al. 2012).

**3.2.3 Flavanones**

The flavanones have the flavanoid skeleton devoid of the double bond between the
carbons 2 and 3, unlike the flavones and flavonols (Zuiter 2014). Flavanones, in
particular, the methoxy flavanones have been extensively studied to understand their
modulation of the xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes; and it includes hesperidin,
hesperetin, morin, naringin, eriodictyol, naritutin, didimin and naringenin.

Famurewa et al. (2022) have studied the efficacy of the flavanones hesperidin and
hesperetin in blocking the toxicity associated with heavy metals and have shown
that the flavanones have the potential to modulate the signalling networks associated
with the heavy metal induced dysregulations such as Nrf2/HO-1/ARE. The ability
of hesperidin in the hepatic transformation of xenobiotics in the breast cancer
induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene was investigated and the tests showed
that hesperidin restored all of the altered biochemical pathways, especially by the
induction or inhibition of phase I and II metabolism in breast and liver, and modulation of the lysosomal and TCA cycle enzymes (Nandakumar et al. 2011).

Narirutin is a dihydroxy flavonone commonly found in citrus fruits that exhibits
several health preventive effects. Narirutin is one of the effective protective agent
against drug induced liver injury caused by acetaminophen overdosage.
Acetaminophen or para-acetyl-amino-phenol is the active constituent of the commonly administered analgesic paracetamol for fever and mild to moderate pain control; and increased usage of acetaminophen is one of the common causes of drug
induced hepatotoxicity.

Studies by Fang et al. have shown that the narirutin administration in mice alleviated the oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity by increasing the expression of antioxidant enzymes and by activating the macrophagy/autophagy lysosomal pathway
(Fang et al. 2023). Flavonoids such as narirutin were also found to inhibit the intestinal CYP3A4 resulting in increased bioavailability of drugs without being cleared
by the drug metabolizing enzymes (Kondža et al. 2021).

Recent study by Singh et al. have shed light on the ability of narirutin in micro-­
RNA targeted chemoprevention and cancer therapy, and predicted that narirutin
could be an antagonist of oncogenic microRNAs in the body (Singh et al. 2022).
Conversely, there are also in vitro studies that have shown that the flavonoids like


-----

H. B. B. M. Ali


narirutin and naringin has the potential to lower the concentration of medications in
blood by upregulating the CYP3A4 and p-glycoprotein expression (Okada
et al. 2017).

Naringenin is also a flavonoid of the citrus family that has been investigated
extensively for its therapeutic efficacy. Previous studies have shown that naringenin
is found to possess chemo-preventive role as it reduced the metabolic activation of
benzopyrene by inhibiting the aryl hydrocarbon (benzo(a)pyrene) hydroxylase
in vitro and protected against the pro-toxicants activated by the cytochrome P450
1A2 monooxygenase (Ueng et al. 1999).

**3.2.4 Flavones and Isoflavones**

The flavones and isoflavones are chromone ring containing polyphenolic compounds, which are one of the predominant dietary flavanoids and include apigenin,
chrysin, baicalein, luteolin, diosmin, chrysin, rhoifolin, daidzein, genistein, daidzin,
genistin, formononetin, tangeritin, glycitein and chrysoeriol.

Tangeretin, which is a pentamethoxy flavone present in the tangerine juice, has
the potential to stimulate cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and found to be an
effective regioselective stimulator of midazolam 1′-hydroxylation in the in vitro
studies using human liver microsomes. However, the effect of tangeretin on CYP3A4
expression in the randomized cross over study in 8 healthy humans did not show any
consistent results (Backman et al. 2000).

Takemura et al. have shown that the methoxyflavonoids such as chrysoeriol (flavone) and isorhamnetin (flavonol) selectively inhibited CYP1B1 that is associated
with the conversion of 17-beta-estradiol (E(2)) to carcinogenic 4-hydroxy-E(2), and
has a potential role in halting the processes of carcinogenesis and cancer progression (Takemura et al. 2010).

Apigenin is a 4′, 5, 7,-trihydroxyflavone and widely known for its potent antioxidant and chemopreventive properties. Svehlikova (2004) examined the influence of
the two phytochemicals sulforaphane and apigenin on phase II metabolising
enzymes in the CaCo-2 cells and the experiments showed that apigenin and sulforaphane induced the expression of UGTA1 by 4 folds and 3.7 folds; and whereas only
sulforophane induced GSTA1 expression by 2.8 folds and apigenin did not have any
significant effect on the GSTA1expression. However, synergistically sulforaphane
and apigenin exhibited an induction of UGT1A1 of up to 12-folds.

The anti-oxidant and chemo-preventive ability of the flavones apigenin and luteolin to induce NRF2-mediated gene expression associated with xenobiotic induced
oxidative stress and inflammation was studied by Paredes-Gonzalez et al. (2015) in
HepG2 cells; and the tests showed that both the flavones at a low doses (1.56–6.25
μm) did not show any significant influence on the NRF2-mediated gene expression.
However, the higher doses of the phytochemicals significantly activated the PI3K/
Nrf2/ARE system marked by the suppression of lipopolysaccharide-induced biochemical markers.

**3.2.5 Anthocyanidins**


51


The most common anthocyanidins are malvinidin, petunidin, delphinidin, pelargonidin, peonidin, and cyanidin. Anthocyanidins have been found to be associated the
control of inflammation and in regulating the scavenging of intracellular reactive
oxygen species (Bonetti et al. 2017).
###### ***3.3 Non-flavonoid Polyphenols***

**3.3.1 Phenolic Acids**

The phenolic acids contain a phenol ring linked to a carboxyl group. They are classified into two groups, namely the benzoic acid derivatives and the cinnamic acid
derivatives. The hydroxycinnamic acid of fruits mainly includes caffeic, ferulic,
coumaric, sinapic, chlorogenic, cinnamic and rosamarinic acid; and the hydroxybenzoic acid mainly includes gallic, ellagic, vanillic, syringic and para-hydroxy
benzoic acid.

The chemopreventive effect of sinapic acid was tested against dimethylhydrazine induced carcinogenesis in rat colon; and the expression of drug-metabolizing
enzymes of phase I (cytochrome P450 and P4502E1) were enhanced and the levels of phase II enzymes (GST, DT-diaphorase and UGT) were reduced in response
to the xenobiotic in the liver and mucosa of colon cells; and the effects were
reversed upon sinapic acid supplementation (Balaji et al. 2014). In a similar study
induced by the same xenobiotic in rats, p-methoxy cinnamic acid was effective in
modulating the enzymes associated with inflammation and cancer (Sivagami
et al. 2012).

**3.3.2 Coumarins**

Coumarins are benzopyrone derivatives that comprises fused benzene and α-pyrone
rings. They comprise simple coumarin, furanocoumarin, pyranocoumarin, and
phenyl-­coumarin. A great deal of researches have been done recently on the influence of various coumarins in regulating the expression of detoxification enzymes
and the chemoprevention.

In vitro studies by Kimura et al. (2010a, b) on the efficacy of about sixty polyphenols for their modulation of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 activity and found that
among the tested phytonutrients, three of the coumarins and twelve other flavonoids
exhibited a marked inhibition of both CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 activities.

Furanocoumarins such as isopimpinellin, imperatorin and trioxsalen have been
found to be a potent chemopreventive agents as they mediated the inhibition of
CYP1A2 mediated procarcinogen activation (Kleiner et al. 2001, 2003). Also, the


-----

52


H. B. B. M. Ali


furanocoumarins found in several fruits and vegetables such as bergamottin and
6′,7′-dihydroxybergamottin are found to be inhibitors of some of the phase I metabolising enzymes (Masuda et al. 2017).

**3.3.3 Lignans and Flavolignans**

Dietary lignans are phenyl propanoid dimers and one of the large group of the
polyphenolic compounds. Flavanolignans are a unique class of lignans that comprises a phenylpropanoid moiety and a flavanoid moiety. The dietary lignans and
flavanolignans comprise pinoresinol, matairesinol, lariciresinol, sesamol, sesamin
and silibin.

Lee et al. (2009) have studied the therapeutic efficacy of nine lignans isolated
from *Schisandra chinensis*, commonly known as five flavoured berries that has a
sweet, sour, pungent, salty and bitter taste, in HepG2 human hepatocarcinoma cells.
The investigation shows that the lignans possess an intense chemopreventive activity mediated by the induction of the phase II detoxification enzyme NQO1 through
nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 through the Nrf2-ARE pathway, especially the lignans tigloylgomisin H and angeloylgomisin H were found to be a potent chemopreventive agent as they significantly induced the quinone reductase activity.

Silymarin is a mixture of polyphenolic flavonolignans, particularly silibinins,
extracted from the plant Silybum marianum, commonly known as milk thistle.
Silymarin is traditionally used to cure liver and digestive tract problems
(Wadhwa et al. 2022). The effect of silymarin on mucositis, which is a cancer
chemotherapy mediated gastrointestinal tract disorder, was tested on mucosal
barrier injury in mice induced by epirubicin. The findings showed that the silymarin effectively reduced the condition of gastrointestinal mucositis and may
prevent the gastrointestinal damage caused by epirubicin-induced toxicity.
During this study, various gene expressions were studied including Bax, Bcl-2,
p53 and particularly cytP450 expression. The results presented stronger expression for cyt P450 in the gastrointestinal tissues, demonstrating the intense drug
detoxification. (Sasu et al. 2015).

Kiruthiga et al. (2013) investigated the effect of silymarin on the polyaromatic
hydrocarbon representative benzo(a)pyrine toxicity in Wistar rats and found that the
levels of hepatic phase I (CYP1A1) enzymes, which converts the xenobiotic into a
reactive toxic intermediate, are inhibited; and the phase II enzymes, namely GST,
epoxide hydroxylases and UGT, are modulated. Similar studies have shown that
Nrf2 and pregnane X receptor (PXR) were the key players associated with the activation of detoxifying genes against the formation of B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-­
epoxide DNA adducts (Jee et al. 2020).

Studies on chemoprotective activity of silibinin against colon cancer in rats
against the carcinogenesis mediated by the xenobiotic 1,2 di-methylhydrazine
(DMH) have shown that the test group administered with silibinin modulated the
xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes leading to the DMH clearance, whereas the rats
exposed to only DMH exhibited increased activities of cytochrome b5 reductase,

cytochromeP450 reductase, CYP2E1 and decreased the activities of UGT, GST and
DT-diaphorase in both the liver and colon cells (Fig. 3.1).

**3.3.4 Garcinol**

Garcinol is an active constituent of the Genus *Garcinia*, including *Garcinia indica*
and *Garcinia cambogia*, which are indigenous plants of South East Asia, America,
Australia and Africa. Garcinol is a polyisoprenylated benzophenone that has been
found to play a key role in the chemoprevention as it exhibited the potential to
strongly inhibit human leukaemia HL-60 cells with an IC50 value of 9.42 μM by
inducing apoptosis via releasing cytochrome c into the cytosol, processing procaspase-­9, activating caspases 2 & 3, inducing the degradation of poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP), and mediating DNA fragmentation (Pan et al. 2001). Garcinol
also prevented colonic aberrant crypt foci in male F344 rats when fed with experimental diet containing garcinol indicating its effectiveness in inhibiting colon
tumorigenesis (Tanaka et al. 2000a). Kopytko et al. (2021) emphasizes the role of
garcinol in epigenetic regulation by inhibition of histone acetyl transferases and
deregulation of miRNA associated with the development and progression of cancer cells.

Study by Bolla L in rats was intended to evaluate the inhibitory action of garcinol
on cytochrome P450 isozymes when co-administered with the other drugs and the
investigation showed strong inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, CYP2D6
and CYP3A4 with IC50 values of 7.6, 8.0, 2.1, 9.5 and 5.1 μM, respectively; and
also moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 and CYP2E1 with IC50 values of 16.4 and

19.0 μM, respectively (Bolla et al. 2021) (Fig. 3.2).

**3.3.5 Stilbens**

The stilbens include resveratrol, matteucinol, pinosylvin, and piceatonnol. Extensive
researches have been performed on resveratrol that is a trihydroxy-trans-stilbene of
grapes and peanuts. Numerous studies have shown that the resveratrol has immense
potential to inhibit phase I metabolism playing a remarkable role in chemoprevention and to induce phase II enzymes (Guthrie et al. 2017; Canistro et al. 2009; Piver
et al. 2001; Ji et al. 2021). Also, resveratrol has been found to play a crucial role in
the inflammation prevention through the downregulation of expression of adhesion
molecules (Calabriso et al. 2015).

**3.3.6 Tannins**

The tannins are polyphenolic compounds widely distributed in tea leaves (e.g. epigallocatechin gallate) and include mainly the hydrolysed and condensed tannins.
The protective effect of tannic acid on murine phase I and phase II enzymes were
explored and the results showed that there was a considerable reduction in the
hepatic CYP2E1 levels, whereas the GST from kidney is elevated and reduced in
livers, while the hepatic and renal NQO1 is inhibited (Krajka-Kuźniak 2003).

**3.3.7 Curcuminoids**


55


There are several pharmaceutically active constituents of the roots of *Curcuma*
*longa*, commonly known as turmeric, which is a very common ingredient of several
Asian cuisines that gives the yellow colour to the food and is also used in cosmetics
traditionally and Ayurvedic medicine. Curcumin is a polyphenol (diferuloyl methane) that belongs to a class of curcuminoids comprising curcumin, demethoxy curcumin and bis-demethoxy curcumin, among which curcumin is widely known for
its various health benefits including anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-­
carcinogenic activity (Jurenka 2009; White et al. 2019). It is a potent inhibitor of
NF-κB and its downstream genes, several growth factors and cell adhesion molecules associated with cancers and also an initiator of several inflammatory and
immunogenic factor activation involved in cancers (Wilken et al. 2011).

Curcumin is also well known for its protective effects against toxic chemicals in
liver, brain and cardiovascular tissues; and is also found to be associated with the
prevention and treatment of various cancers. For instance, the hepatoprotective
activity of curcumin in mercuric chloride toxicity was studied in mice and the
results have shown that curcumin significantly increased the nuclear translocation
of Nrf2 that is associated with the increase of cells to oxidants and electrophiles
resulting in the induction of detoxifying gene expressions, particularly cyp450 signalling to eliminate mercuric chloride toxicity (Li et al. 2021; Pouremamali
et al. 2022).

In order to understand the turmeric mediated chemoprevention, in vitro studies
on rat liver microsomes using curcumin, dimethoxy curcumin and bis-demethoxy
curcumin against benzo(a)pyrene and 4-methylnitrosamino-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-­
butanone chemicals and the results showed that the curcumin is the most effective

in inhibiting the activation of carcinogens, metabolized by the CYP1A1, CYP1A2
and CYP2B1 cytochrome P450 enzymes (Thapliyal and Maru 2001). Iqbal M et al.
studied the cancer chemopreventive action on curcumin in mice by subjecting them
to dietary curcumin at 2%, w/v for 30 days and found that curcumin significantly
increased the activities of the xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, GST, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, quinone
reductase and catalase in liver and kidney cells of mice (Iqbal et al. 2003) (Fig. 3.3).
###### ***3.4 Other Bioactive Dietary Agents***

Besides polyphenol, vitamins, minerals, sterols, bioactive peptides, essential fats
and oils, alkaloids, organosulfur compounds, terpenoids and other protecting bioactive dietary agents such as butyrate from fermented plant or animal product,
immense potential in the elimination of toxic chemicals and in the prevention and
control of cancers.

**3.4.1 Organosulfur Compounds**


H. B. B. M. Ali


The organosulfur compounds include indole, allyl sulphur compounds and isothiocyanates. Numerous studies have reported the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and
chemopreventive potential of organosulfur compounds. They are found to modulate
the expression of detoxification systems of cytochromes of phase I metabolism such
as CYP2B, CYP3A2 and CYP1A2; and the expression of several phase II metabolizing enzymes such as quinone reductase, and GST (Navarro et al. 2009; Wark
2004; Yoxall et al. 2005).

Tan et al. (2010) studied the chemoprotective property of the phytochemicals
sulforaphane, epigallocatechin gallate, green tea and broccoli sprout extracts,
phenethyl isothiocyanate and benzyl isothiocyanate by inducing the expression of
glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) and NQO1; and the tests showed that, among
the tested phytochemicals, the extracts of green tea and broccoli sprout, and sulforaphane were effective in the induction of the phase II metabolizing enzymes.

**3.4.2 Terpenoids**

The terpenoids will include carotenoid terpenoids (α/β/γ-carotene, lutein, lycopene,
astaxanthin, canthaxanthin and β-cryptoxanthin) and the non-carotenoid terpenoids
(phytosterols, phytostanols, saponins, limonene, ursolic acid and perillyl alcohol).

The effect of 4-oxocarotenoids, namely canthaxanthin and astaxanthin, and also
lutein and lycopene on liver metabolizing enzymes were studied in rats by screening
the levels of phase I cytochrome P4501A1 & 1A2 enzymes, and phase II enzymes,
particularly 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) UDP-GT and quinone reductase (QR). The oxocartotenoid canthaxanthin induced the P4501A1 and 1A2 enzymes, which was

57


evident by the significant increase of some of the P450-dependent markers, especially ethoxy-resorufin O-deethylase (EROD), methoxyresorufin O-demethylase
(MROD), pentoxy-resorufin O-deethylase (PROD) and benzoxyresorufin
O-dealkylases (BROD), and also co-induced 4NP-UGT and QR enzymes.
Conversely, the canthaxanthin decreased nitrosodimethylamine N-demethylase
(NDMAD) activity and did not influence the erythromycin N-demethylase (ERDM)
activities. Inclusion of canthaxanthin in the diet of rats at a dose of about 10 ppm
clearly showed the increase of EROD, MROD and 4NP-UGT, whereas the induction of QR was detectable in doses of greater than or equal to 100 ppm.

Astaxanthin also exhibited the same pattern of enzyme induction similar to canthaxanthin, but to a lesser extent. The effect of phase I enzymes and 4NP-UGT were
observed in diets greater than or equal to 100 ppm of astaxanthin, and did not exhibit
any influence on QR activity. Lutein did not have any influence on the effect of both
phase I and phase II enzymes, and lycopene was found to only decrease the NDMAD
activity, like canthaxanthin (Gradelet et al. 1996).

Limonoid is a non-carotenoid terpernoid commonly found in the citrus fruits and
some of the limonoid compounds such as nomilin, isoobacunoic acid and deacetyl
nomilin are found to induce the GSTs of stomach and intestine triggering the detoxification systems and favouring the elimination of the toxic substances (Perez
et al. 2010).

Sinapic acid, p-methoxy cinnamic acid, luteolin, and phytosterol β-sitosterol
exhibited a protective action against 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine-induced depletion of
enzymes associated with oxidative stress such as inflammation and cancers such as
catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, GST
in rat colon and liver (Balaji et al. 2014; Sivagami et al. 2012; Baskar et al. 2012;
Manju et al. 2005).

**3.4.3 Alkaloids**

There are several alkaloids present in food and it include pyrollidines, pyridines,
pyrrolidizines and quinolines. There are several studies continuously made on their
chemopreventive nature of the alkaloids.
###### **4 Role of Dietary Nutrients in ADME**

Several researches in the past had investigated the role of food-based components in
the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases, delaying ageing and promotion of
overall health and well-being. In comparison with the chemical drugs having a specific pharmaceutical activity, the dietary nutraceuticals and other phytochemicals
provide a safety health profile with very few undesirable side effects and also can be
as effective as a chemical drug with a diverse array of wellness. Hence,

nutraceuticals have gained significant attention for protecting health and prevention
or treatment of a disease or a disorder.

Most notably, functional foods have been widely investigated for their potential
in elimination of toxic endogenous and exogenous substrates by the modulation of
metabolic pathways associated with the biotransformation of toxic chemicals into
water soluble and non-toxic forms readily eliminated in the urine or bile. The exposure and accumulation of the toxic chemical chemicals in the body eventually leads
to chronic diseases like cancer, obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. The bioactive dietary agents such as polyphenolic compounds, particularly
flavonoids and non-flavonoids, dietary fats and oils, bioactive peptides, vitamins
and minerals play a pivotal role in modulating the detoxification pathways.

The pharmaceutically active phytochemicals, that largely influences the ADME
and mediates the xenobiotic clearance from the body, includes functional foods
such as vegetables (cruciferous, apiaceous, allium and nightshade vegetables), fruits
(tropical, citrus, other subtropical fruits and temperate), spices, green tea polyphenols, green and herbs, whole grains, legumes, bioactive peptides, dietary fiber, probiotics and gut fermentation products.
###### ***4.1 Vegetables in ADME***

**4.1.1 Cruciferous Vegetables**

The cruciferous vegetables belong to the Brassicaceae family, which includes several leafy vegetables and sprouts including the very common dietary vegetables like
broccoli, cauli flower, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, kale, turnip and radish. They are
rich in several potential antioxidants and cancer protecting agents such as polyphenols, carotenoids, sulphur containing glucosinolates and S-methyl sulfoxide
(Soundararajan and Kim 2018; Zeng et al. 2023).

The effect of dietary consumption of broccoli on CYP1A2 and CYP2A6, enzymatic activities was studied and the results showed that the broccoli consumption
significantly increased the expression of CYP1A2 and CYP2A6 in all the 10 volunteers (Hakooz and Hamdan 2007). Previous researches on the phytonutrients of
cruciferous vegetables have shown the induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 in
humans and induction of CYP1B1 in animals (Peterson et al. 2009).

Several studies have been done on the indoles, which are the active constituents
of cruciferous vegetables, in the estrogen detoxification through cytochrome P450
enzymes to check their chemopreventive efficacy against the estrogen responsive
tumours. Studies by Michnovicz and Bradlow (1990) have shown that the hepatic
estradiol-3-hydroxylation mediated by the cytochrome P450 enzymes was induced
in rats. A similar study by Horn et al. 2002 on the metabolism of estrogen have
shown an increase in the expression of mRNA levels of cytochrome P450 in liver
and mammary glands.

Leibelt et al. in 2003 has demonstrated that the indole-3-carbinol and 3,3′-diindolylmethane phytochemicals found in the cruciferous vegetables have the potential
to induce CYP1A1 (liver and colon) and CYP1A2 (liver) in rats; and induce
CYP3A2 only in female rats. Thus, indole-3-carbinol is an effective inducer of
expression of several cytochrome P450 enzymes when compared to the indole-­3-­
carbinol (Leibelt et al. 2003).

A similar research on consumption of cruciferous vegetables by providing daily
diet rich in 250 grams each of Brussels sprouts and broccoli on the metabolism of
heterocyclic amine (2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine) present in
cooked meat; and the results showed that the consumption of cruciferous vegetable
induces both the phase I and II metabolism of heterocyclic amines with increased
urinary clearance of the xenobiotic during the phase of vegetable consumption in
comparison to the control phases with no inclusion in diet (Walters 2004).

Isothiocyanates are also one of the active constituents of many of the cruciferous
vegetables. Studies by Navarro et al. (2009) in 33 men and 34 women on cruciferous
vegetable supplementation have shown that the consumption has increased the
phase II metabolizing enzyme GST noted by the induction of the GST variants
GSTA1/2. Similar studies by Kall et al. (1996) in an in vivo experiment in 16
humans have shown that the intake of dietary broccoli influences human CYP1A2
and other drug metabolizing enzymes resulting in the prevention of
carcinogenesis.

Similarly, sulforaphane present in the cruciferous vegetables were found to
decrease the CYP2B and CYP3A2 apoprotein levels and upregulate the CYP1A2
levels in rats. With respect to the phase II metabolizing enzymes, sulforophane was
found to stimulate quinone reductase in a dose-dependent manner, and did not have
any marked influence the expression of GST, epoxide hydrolase and glucuronosyl
transferase enzymes (Yoxall et al. 2005). Wark (2004) had reported that the glucosinolates and dithiolthiones of the Brassica family induced the human rectal GST
detoxification enzymes’.

Chinese cabbage widely consumed in East Asia, rich in polyphenols like quercetin and kaempferol, was tested for the efficacy against stress related pathological
conditions in endothelial cells of human umbilical vein; and it was found that the
phytonutrients could suppress tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced inflammatory
response resulting in anti-adhesive activity mediated by the downregulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) via an Nrf-2 pathway resulting in the
expression of ARE triggered expression of the cell protecting enzymes (Joo et al.
2017). Kale or leaf cabbage also did exhibit a similar reduction of TNF-α induced
cell adhesion molecules E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 mRNA expression
(Kuntz and Kunz 2014) (Fig. 3.4).

**4.1.2 Apiaceous Vegetables**

Vegetables like carrots, celery, parsley, dill, fennel, cilantro and parsnips that belong
to the *Apiaceae* family are rich sources of flavonoid polyphenols and found to have
a profound effect on the detoxification pathways. Three of the furanocoumarins
from apiaceous vegetables, namely isopimpinellin, imperatorin and trioxsalen, were
tested for their chemopreventive activity and the researches have shown that the
furanocoumarins inhibited CYP1A2 mediated procarcinogen activation, particularly isopimpinellin exhibited a longer inhibition of the CYP1A2 enzyme (Kang
et al. 2011). Similar studies on the inhibition of tumor initiation in mice and human
breast MCF-7 adenocarcinoma cell lines by imperatorin and isopimpinellin have
been reported by Kleiner et al. (2001, 2003) to be inhibiting the DNA adduct formation by blocking the cytochrome P450 mediated bioactivation of the polycyclic

aromatic hydrocarbon carcinogens, namely benzo[a]pyrene and
7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene.

Peterson et al. (2006) studied eight of the phytochemicals that are active constituents of the apiaceous vegetables, namely psoralen, 5-methoxy psoralen,
8-methoxy psoralen, apigenin, quercetin, narigenin, caffeic acid and chlorogenic
acid, to inhibit CYP2C1 activity, particularly chemoprevention by inhibition of
CYP1A2-mediated mutagenicity of aflatoxin B1 in yeast cells. The results showed
that psoralen, 5-methoxy psoralen and 8-methoxy psoralen significantly reduced the
aflatoxin B1 mediated mutagenicity by inhibiting the CYP1A2 mediated methoxyresorufin O-demethylase activity and exhibited improved cell survival in comparison with other phytochemicals. Also, quercetin showed inhibition against CYP1A2
and apigenin significantly reduced the mutagenicity caused by aflatoxin B1 in the
yeast cells (Peterson et al. 2006) (Fig. 3.5).

**4.1.3 Allium Vegetables**


H. B. B. M. Ali


Garlic, onion, shallots, green onions, chives and leeks are the vegetables that belong
to the *Allium* family and contain several organosulfur compounds, polyphenols and
saponins such as kaempferol, ferulic acid, quercetin and its derivatives, isorhamnetin, delphinidin, gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, anthocyanins, naringenin, hesperidin, luteolin, apigenin, chrysoeriol, balcalein, fisetin, morin, catechin, epicatechin
and other organosulfur compounds such as allicin, alliin, diallyl sulphide/disulphide/trisulfide, S-allyl-cysteine, ajoene, and propin (Fossen and Andersen 2003;
Fredotović et al. 2017; Kothari et al. 2020; Shang et al. 2019).

Many of the phytochemicals of the Allium family, particularly the lipophilic sulphur containing compounds have found to have an effective role in the detoxification reactions. Research by Ip and Lisk (1997) have shown that selenium enriched
garlic diet in rats inhibited the initiation of cancer by the cancer-causing chemical
dimethyl benz[a]anthracene (DMBA). Rats fed with selenium and garlic containing
diet for two weeks resulted in significant reduction of the DMBA adducts in liver
and mammary gland. No significant changes were observed in the expression of
phase I metabolising enzymes, particularly CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2B1, CYP2E1
and CYP3A4. But then, the phase II metabolising enzymes, in particular, GST and
UGT activities were elevated to about 2 to 2.5 folds in the cells of liver and kidney.

Zeng et al. (2009) have shown that the garlic oil is effective in inhibiting the
hepatic CYP2E1 and CYP1A2; and did not produce any marked changes in the
expression of CYP3A indicating that it did not exhibit any interaction with the
metabolism of concomitant pharmaceutical drugs. Similar study by Ho (2010) on
the effect of garlic extract on human hepatocytes have shown that the exposure of
hepatocytes to garlic extract for about 4 days resulted in the reduction of CYP2C9
activity by about 90%, but had no effects on CYP3A4 enzymatic activity.

Onion is specifically rich in alkyl polysulphides, glycosides and flavonols and
play a crucial role in inhibiting the chemical induced cancers and inducing the
detoxification of toxic chemicals. Teyssier et al. (2001) investigated the role of
onion powder in the detoxification pathways in rats. Rats fed with a diet containing
20% onion powder for 9 days have shown remarkable induction of CYP1A and
CYP2B activities, whereas the CYP2E1 activity is reduced. In addition to these
changes, the detoxification enzymes UGT and GST were induced. Together, the
onion powder inhibited the cytochrome p450 enzymes associated with the carcinogen activation and also enhanced the phase II metabolising enzymes involved in the
elimination of the toxic compounds (Fig. 3.6).

**4.1.4 Nightshade Vegetables**

Tomato, capsicum (bell pepper), chilly, potato and eggplant (brinjal) belong to the
family of Solanaceae, which are referred to as the nightshade vegetables. They are
nutritious vegetables that possesses several vitamins, minerals, dietary fibers and

flavonoids like anthocyanins; and have been the staple food for centuries worldwide. They also possess various alkaloids in minute amounts and are often associated with allergies, inflammation and some intestinal disorders (Kuang et al. 2023).

Bhuvaneswari et al. (2005) have studied the chemoprotective effects of garlic
and tomato on hamster buccal pouch carcinogenesis induced by
7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). The results showed that the combination
tomato and garlic significantly decreased the phase I enzymes involved in the cancer
initiation; and increased the phase II enzymes in the pouch and liver eventually
leading to the clearance of the toxin from the body (Fig. 3.7).

Spices are the essential ingredients in most of the global cuisines, as it enhances
aroma, colour, flavour and palatability of foods. Kimura et al. studied 55 spices
widely used in the culinary preparations for their inhibitory potential against the
most common cyp isoforms, CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. Among the tested spices,
about 36 spices exhibited more than 50% inhibition, particularly 11 of the spices
showed marked inhibition of the cyp isoforms, predicted through testosterone
6β-hydroxylation and diclofenac 4′-hydroxylation. The spices white pepper, mace,
black pepper, nutmeg, ginger, turmeric, cinnamon (Chinese) and cinnamon
(Srilankan) exhibited an IC50 value of 1.0, 3.9, 4.1, 4.2, 5.1, 17.0, 24.0 and 30.0 μg/ml
against CYP3A4 (Japanese pepper, Sichuan pepper & sage not tested); and the
spices mace, nutmeg, white pepper, ginger, black pepper, cinnamon (Chinese), turmeric, cinnamon (Srilankan), sage, Sichuan pepper and Japanese pepper exhibited

an IC50 value of 1.1, 2.6, 3.2, 10.0, 12.1, 12.4, 14.8, 15.2, 29.0, 32.0 and 36.0 μg/ml
against CYP3A4 isoform (Kimura et al. 2010b) (Fig. 3.8).
###### ***4.3 Green Tea Polyphenols in ADME***

Green tea comprises several polyphenolic compounds, particularly the flavanols
epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, epicatechin, and epicatechin-3-gallate.
The green tea catechins have shown a strong modulatory effects on the enzymes and
transporters associated with the metabolism of drugs and the exogenous and endogenous toxic chemicals.

Srinivasan et al. studied the influence of green tea polyphenols through the modulation of various enzymes of detoxification metabolism against 4-nitroquinoline

1-oxide induced oral cancer in mice. The phase I and phase II enzymes of study,
namely cytochrome b5 and P450 reductase, aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase,
DT-diaphorase, GST and UGT, was screened for their influence in chemoprevention; and the results showed a significant inhibition of the phase I enzymes due to
the immense protective nature of the polyphenol to deactivate the carcinogen and
also induction of the phase II enzymes mediating the clearance of the toxic chemical
(Srinivasan et al. 2008).

Satoh et al. (2016) studied the inhibitory effect of 8 green tea catechin on the
cytochrome enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4; and found that
all gallated catechin exhibited inhibition except CYP2D6, particularly

−
( )-catechin-­3-O-gallate inhibited CYP2C9 with an IC50 value of 7.60 μM; and
epigallocatechin-gallate inhibited CYP1A2 with an IC50 value of 8.93 μM.

Orientin is a glycosyl flavonoid found abundantly in rooibos tea that is found to
be potent in protecting oxidative stress relating conditions when tested on rats by
modulating the activities of the phase I and phase II drug metabolizing enzymes and
favours the detoxification of carcinogen (Thangaraj et al. 2018) (Fig. 3.9).

###### ***4.4 Dietary Oils & Fats in ADME***

**4.4.1 Dietary Oils & Fats**


67


The effect of dietary oils, namely fish oil, olive oil, hazel nut oil and corn oil, and
the influence of dietary supplements, particularly 1% cholesterol or DL-tocopherol
acetate, and beta carotene on liver microsome membrane fluidity and the concentration of the metabolizing enzymes, cyt P450, aniline hydroxylase (AH), aminopyrine-­
N-­dimethylase (AND) and UDP-glucuronyltransferase (UDP-GT), was tested on
rats. The results showed that the consumption of fish oil had the overall effect of
increasing the membrane fluidity of liver microsomes and increased content of the
metabolizing enzymes, particularly Cyt P450 and UDP-GT (Lutz et al. 1998). Studies
on dietary cholesterol in humans and rats have shown that the intake of cholesterol
plays a significant role in altering liver microsomal fluidity and influencing the
xenobiotic metabolic pathways (Hietanen et al. 1982; Lutz et al. 1999; Muriana
et al. 1992a, b; Siess et al. 1983).

**4.4.2 Poly Unsaturated Fatty Acids**

Several studies had been conducted on the roles of dietary fats on xenobiotic metabolism. For instance, studies by Yoo et al. on consumption of dietary corn oil in rats
revealed alteration of constitutive and induced levels of GST isozyme and some of
the P450 enzymes; and dietary intake of poly unsaturated fatty acid studies by
Kravchenko et al. have shown that the activity of liver metabolizing enzymes was
similar in rats fed with diets of lard or corn oil, while the activities of epoxide hydrolase and UDP-GT were considerably higher fish oil diet group (Yoo et al. 1990;
Kravchenko et al. 1992).

The increase in membrane fluidity was also observed in hazel nut oil in comparison with olive oil or corn oil, whereas the consumption of cholesterol decreased the
fluidity in all dietary groups. The beta-carotene was found to exhibit higher Cyt
P450 activity in combination with fish oil, corn oil or olive oil. In particular, the
microsomal fluidity and AH activity was induced in beta-carotene and olive oil
group, the UDP-GT activity was high in beta-carotene and corn-oil group, the
enzyme AND activity increased with beta-carotene and hazel nut oil group, and the
AH activity increased with beta-carotene and fish oil group (Lutz et al. 1998)
(Fig. 3.10).
###### ***4.5 Fruits in ADME***

Based on the geographical location, fruits can be classified as tropical, sub-tropical
and temperate fruits. Tropical fruits grow in the warm tropical climates and will not
be able to withstand any cold temperatures. Sub-tropical fruits grow in regions

adjacent to the tropics that also requires warm temperature for fruiting and also can
tolerate mild frost. These fruits are adapted to the temperature in the mid-latitude
and requires chill temperatures for fruiting. The following section covers the different types of fruit juices and their stimulatory or inhibitory actions on the metabolizing enzymes that gives us an insight of the effect on nutraceuticals on drug
metabolism.

Several researches are done on the concomitant intake of fruit juices with various
drugs resulting in the modulating effects of the drug metabolizing enzymes and
other transporter proteins (Mallhi et al. 2015). The fruits encompass several carotenoids, sterols and stanols, phenolic compounds including the flavonoids and non-­
flavonoids and other nutraceuticals that has several beneficial health effects, and has
a strong influence on xenobiotic metabolism and multi-drug transporters (Lan et al.
2013; Sayago-Ayerdi et al. 2021).

**4.5.1 Citrus Fruits**

The citrus fruits are rich in essential nutrients, minerals and antioxidants such as
vitamin C; and include orange, grape fruit, lemon, lime, mandarin and tangerine.
They are one of the predominant and oldest domesticated crop, liked all around the
world for their fresh fruits.

There have been several researches on the citrus triterpenoids in inducing the
phase II metabolizing enzymes supporting the xenobiotic clearance from the body
(Tanaka et al. 2000b; Takanaga et al. 2000). Studies by Perez et al. (2010), in an
excised tissue from a mouse model, have shown that the citrus bioactive limonoids
(sour orange), namely nomilin, isoobacunoic acid and deacetyl nomilin, induced
stomach GST by 58%, 25% and 19%, respectively, against the xenobiotic
1-chloro-­2,4-dinitrobenzene, whereas the GST in the liver is reduced by limonoid
and isoobacunoic acid mixture. Nomilin as well as the limonoid mixture induced

GST activity in both intestine and stomach, while deacetyl nomilin induced only the
intestinal GST. Besides GST, the other potential phase II detoxification enzymes,
namely NAD(P)H: quinone reductase (QR) activity was also induced by the
triterpenoids.

The effect of major citrus fruit polyphenols, namely nobiletin, sinensetin, tangeretin, rutinosides, didymin, hesperidin and narirutin, on human organic anion
transporting polypeptides 1B1, 1B3 and 2B1, have shown that all of the tested flavonoids strongly inhibit OATP2B1 with an IC 50 of 1.6–14.2 μM, but only the polymethoxyflavones nobiletin, sinensetin, and tangeretin inhibit OATP1B1 and 1B3 at
2.1–21 μM (Bajraktari-Sylejmani and Weiss 2020).

Citrus fruits, especially grape fruit juice have been reported to be the major cytochrome P450 inhibitors. Fujita et al. (2008) have reported that the citrus species,
especially the citrus extracts rich in naringin, bergamottin and 6′,7′-dihydroxybergamottin are reported to be potential inhibitors of CYP3A4, one of the significant
phase I enzyme involved in the generation of reactive intermediates triggering carcinogenesis. Besides grape fruit, also other citrus fruits such as lime fresh and
sweetie peel that are rich in furanocoumarins, especially bergamottin and 6′,7′-dihydroxybergamottin are strong inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes (Masuda
et al. 2017).

On the contrary, some of the citrus fruit juices do not inhibit the cytochrome
enzymes, rather modulate the drug transporters enhancing the detoxification process. For instance, the methoxy flavones from the orange juice was tested in Caco-2
cells for their modulation of xenobiotic metabolism. The citrus compounds heptamethoxyflavone (HMF), tangeretin and nobiletin enhanced the drug uptake by the
inhibition of the p-glycoprotein that mediates the drug efflux, and does not inhibit
the CYP3A4 (Takanaga et al. 2000).

The citrus fruit juices from grapefruit and orange juice inhibited the organic
anion-transporting polypeptide B (OATP2B1) expressed in the intestinal epithelial
cells thereby blocking the intestinal absorption of anionic drugs via the inhibition of
OATP-B (Satoh et al. 2005). Another study by Shirasaka et al. (2013) on grape fruit,
orange and apple juice, having the flavonoids, particularly naringin, naringenin,
hesperidin, hesperetin, phloridzin, phloretin, quercetin, and kaempferol, inhibited
OATP2B1-mediated estrone-3-sulfate uptake with IC 50 values of 0.222%, 0.807%
and 2.27% for grape fruit, orange and apple juice respectively (Fig. 3.11).

Resveratrol (RSV) is a 3,5,4-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene that is commonly found in
grapes, peanuts and wine. There are several studies that emphasises the potential of
RSV in chemoprevention by the inhibition of bioactivation of phase I metabolizing
enzymes and also induction of detoxifying phase II enzymes (Guthrie et al. 2017).
In CD1 male mice, the effect of resveratrol on cytochrome P450 and phase II
enzyme activity in liver and lung was investigated. The cytochrome P450 enzymes
were significantly suppressed by up to 61% and 97% loss for the CYP3A1/2-linked
6 beta-hydroxylation of testosterone in liver and 2 alpha-hydroxylase in lung,
respectively. With respect to the phase II enzymes, GST was significantly inhibited
in lung (about 76% loss), whereas the UGT was significantly induced by about 83%
in liver and reduced in the lung (of about 83% loss) (Canistro et al. 2009).

The role of RSV (about 10 μM in red wine) and red wine solids (RWS) in the
cancer cell initiation and progression was tested in microsomes from rat liver,
human liver or cells containing cDNA-expressed cytochromes by their ability to
inhibit the metabolism of testosterone, chlorzoxazone, and ethoxyresorufin. Both
RSV and RWS were irreversible inhibitors for CYP3A4 and reversible inhibitors
for CYP2E1 (Piver et al. 2001). The enantiomers of resveratrol significantly inhibited CYP2C9, CYP3A, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2E1 and uridine
5′-diphosphoglucuronosyl transferases (UGT1A1) in human liver microsomes (Ji
et al. 2021).

Also, studies show that the red wine polyphenolic extract has been associated
with the inhibition of vascular inflammation by downregulating the expression of
adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-Selectin, MCP-1 and M-CSF (Calabriso
et al. 2015).

Mulberry fruit extract, rich in cyanidin-3-glucoside, plays a significant role in
chemoprevention and favours the detoxification of xenobiotics. Mulberry extract in
response to the PAH benzo[a]pyrene, mediates the suppression of B[a]P derived
DNA adduct formation in human keratinocytes mediated by the repression of aryl
hydrocarbon receptor signalling (Woo et al. 2017). Chen et al. (2017) have studied
the cytoprotective property of the mulberry extract against ethyl carbamate induced
cytotoxicity, wherein the ethyl carbamate treatment resulted in glutathione (GSH)
depletion and collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, whereas the mulberry extract could significantly inhibit the GSH depletion and restore mitochondrial membrane function.

Pomegranate is found to be a potent inhibitor of CYP3A and CYP2C9 mediated
metabolism of xenobiotics into procarcinogens; and has potent phytochemicals
such as tannins (ellagitannin, punicalagin and punicalin), flavonoids such as anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols, and flavonols. The administration of pomegranate juice was
found to increase the absorption and bioavailability of the drugs buspirone, nitrendipine, metronidazole, saquinavir, and sildenafil by reducing the intestinal CYP3A4
and CYP2C9 (Mansoor et al. 2023). Pomegranate juice exhibited the ability to
inhibit CYP3A metabolism of carbamazepine, particularly enteric and not hepatic
CYP3A (Hidaka et al. 2005); and also inhibit CYP2C9 metabolism of tolbutamide,
again enteric and not hepatic CYP2C9 (Nagata et al. 2006) (Fig. 3.12).

**4.5.3 Other Tropical, Subtropical & Temperate Fruits**

Among the tested dietary phytochemicals against IQ genotoxicity, the black, green
and rooibos tea exhibited the highest inhibitory effect with an IC50 value of
0.8–0.9% followed by the sweet cherry juice with 0.17%, whereas mild inhibition
was observed with an IC50 value of 0.48–0.71% for kiwi, plum and blueberry
juices; and 0.42–0.54% for spinach and onion juices. The extracts from the fruits
red apple, blackberry, strawberry, black currant and watermelon, and the vegetables

**Fig. 3.12** Sub-tropical fruits like pomegranate, grapes, fig, jack fruit and mulberry

moderately suppressed the IQ genotoxicity, whereas the grapefruit, red and white
wine, sour cherry, red currant and pineapple juices were only weakly active; and
Granny Smith green apple, orange and cucumber were ineffective. With respect to
the 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) carcinogen, inhibition of PhIP genotoxicity was much lesser than IQ genotoxicity.

In a similar study by Edenharder et al. (2002), a group of dietary phytochemicals
were tested for their efficacy to protect against the genotoxicity induced by the heterocyclic aromatic amine PhIP derived from cooked red meat in comparison with
the carcinogen 2-acetyl aminofluorene on genetically engineered V79 Chinese hamster fibroblasts that expresses human CYP1A2 and rat sulfotransferase. In this
study, kiwi, blueberries, blackberries, watermelon, green tea, red wine, red grapes,

parsley and spinach strongly reduced the genotoxic activity of PhIP, while the beer,
coffee, black as well as rooibos tea, morellos, black-currants, plums, chives, red
beets, and broccoli were less active. Similarly, the genotoxic activity of 2-acetyl
aminofluorene was strongly reduced by the fruits and vegetables, morellos, black-­
currants, kiwi, watermelon, and spinach, and also green, black, and rooibos tea, and
red wine, whereas the plums, red beets, and broccoli were less potent; and white
grapes, white wine, bananas, and strawberries exhibited no activity.

In a study by Platt et al. (2010), the effect of 15 fruit juices (sweet cherry, kiwi,
plum, blueberry, watermelon, blackberry, strawberry, black currant, red apple, sour
cherry, grapefruit, red currant, pineapple, Granny Smith green apple and orange), 11
vegetable extracts (beetroot, sweet pepper, spinach, onion, broccoli, cauliflower,
tomato, chard, red-cabbage and cucumber), 2 wines (red and white wines) and three
teas (black, green and roiboos tea) to protect against the genotoxicity mediated by
heterocyclic aromatic amines (namely 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline
(IQ) and PhIP, which are potential carcinogens generated during the cooking of red
meat and fish) was tested on genetically engineered V79 Chinese hamster fibroblasts that expresses human xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes CYP1A2, N(O)acetyltransferase and sulfotransferase.

The effect of consumption of tropical fruits banana, guava, mangosteen, pineapple, and ripe mango and papaya on cytochrome P450 activities (CYP1A1,
CYP1A2, CYP2E1 and CYP3A11) were studied in mice and the study had shown
that the pine apple exhibited the strongest inhibition followed by mangosteen,
guava, ripe mango, ripe papaya and banana (Chatuphonprasert and Jarukamjorn
2012) (Figs. 3.13 and 3.14).
###### ***4.6 Greens & Herbs***

*Centella asiatica* has been one of the widely known green included in the diet of
some of the countries like India, China, Srilanka and Southeast Asian countries; and
the pharmaceutically active constituents include asiaticoside, asiatic acid and
madecassic acid. Pan et al. (2010) tested the modulatory potential of plant extracts
and commercially available asiaticoside, asiatic acid and madecassic acid on the
three major cytochrome P450 isoforms. The results showed that the asiatic acid and
madecassic acid selectively inhibited CYP2C9 and CYP2D6 than CYP3A4, while
the extract exhibited an inhibition of CYP2C9 and not CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Also,
studies by Wright et al. (2020) showed that *Centella asiatica* extract had minimal
induction or inhibition of several cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP3A4.

Carnosol is a natural product, which is a diterperne polyphenol, extracted from
the Rosemary and Sage. The cytoprotective effects on carnosol in HepG2 cells have
shown that the rosemary essential oil and carosol increased the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 to stimulate the ARE to increase the intracellular GSH levels promoting
the clearing of toxic substances from the body (Chen et al. 2017).

Dasgupta et al. (2004) studied the potential of basil leaves ( *Ocimum basilicum* )
on xenobiotic metabolism and their antioxidant nature in Swiss albino mice liver

cells. The results showed that the basil leaves were able to induce hepatic GST,
DT-diaphorase, glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase and catalase.

Neem flowers ( *Azadirachta indica var. siamensis* ), Thai fruits, Chinese bitter
gourd ( *Momordica charantia Linn.* ) and sweet basil leaves ( *Ocimum basilicum*
*Linn* ) were screened for their potential to modulate phase I and II enzymes in rat
liver; and the neem flowers and Thai bitter gourd contain phase II enzyme (GST)
inducers; and repressors of monooxygenases, whereas the sweet basil leaves are
bifunctional inducers (inducing phase I and phase II enzymes) and Chinese bitter
gourd fruits represses only the monooxygenases (Kusamran et al. 1998).

Sasaki et al. (2005) investigated the effects of thyme ( *Thymus vulgaris* L.), rich
in phenolic compounds carvacrol and thymol, on the efficacy of xenobiotic-­
metabolizing enzymes such as 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase (ECOD), GST and
quinone reductase (QR). The administration of thyme (2%), thymol (200 mg/kg)
and carvacrol (200 mg/kg) resulted in significantly higher ECOD, GST and QR
activities of 1.1–1.4-fold, 1.3–1.9-fold and 1.3–1.7-fold, respectively (Fig. 3.15).

Rice protein hydrolysates are the sources of various bioactive peptides that are
found to increase the glutathione levels and gamma-glutamyl cysteine synthetase,
regulated by the Nrf2 associated with the expression of heme oxygenase-1 antioxidant enzyme (Morita et al. 2017). Kawakami et al. (2022) studied the protective effects of the rice-derived peptides (RP) on hydrogen peroxide induced
oxidative stress in HepG2 cells and reported that three of the peptides reduced the
oxidative stress through the Nrf2 downstream antioxidant enzyme heme
oxygenase – 1.

Helsby et al. (2000) investigated the role of wheat bran diet in protecting cancers
in rats. The administration of wheat bran diet resulted in significant increase in
CYP3A2 expression and reduced the CYP1A1/A2 expression in hepatic cells. Also,
the GST and glucuronosyl transferase phase II metabolising enzymes were reduced
in hepatic cells. However, the expression of CYP3A, CYP1A and the glutathione
transferase isozymes (GSTA1 & A2) were increased in the colon cells, suggesting
the antimutagenic role of dietary wheat bran.

A cancer study in rats induced by the xenobiotic dimethylhydrazine to test the
efficacy of the phenolic acid p-methoxy cinnamic acid from rice bran was done and
the tests show that the exposure to the xenobiotic decreased the levels of superoxide
dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase; and the effects
were reversed upon the administration of the phenolic acid (Sivagami et al. 2012).
The study showed that p-methoxy cinnamic acid has a major influence on prevention of inflammation and cancers (Fig. 3.16).

Butyrates are short chain fatty acids produced by the gut microbiome when digesting food such as dairy products, legumes, vegetables & fruits, whole grains and
resistant starches from rice and potatoes, which are rich in dietary fibers. Butyrate
is a by-product that is generated in the large intestine of animals and humans

during the fermentation of soluble fibers. The enteric commensal bacterium, in
particular, *Clostrdium butyricum*, *Anaerobutyricum hallii* and *Clostridium beijer-*
*incki* have been associated with butyrate production during fermentation of
dietary fibers.

Researches have shown the butyrate is a significant luminal product that
plays a crucial role in promoting detoxication by inducing the expression of the
GSTP1 protein resulting in clearance of the toxic chemical (Ebert 2003).
Zapletal et al. (2019) studied the chemopreventive action of butyrate in the
colon epithelium against benzo[a]pyrene, which is a common dietary carcinogen; and have observed increased induction of N-acetyltransferase (in particular
NAT2), NQO1 and UGTs by BaP in HCT-116 and HT29 cells, while the enzymatic activity of only NQO1 and UGTs was increased in differentiated Caco-2
cells (Fig. 3.17).

###### **5 Conclusion**


79


Over the past few decades, a great attention has been paid on functional foods rich
in bioactive phytochemicals found to play a significant role in protecting the cells
from oxidative stress induced by the exogenous and endogenous toxic chemical.
The emphasis is on the influence of dietary nutrients on the modulation of the
metabolizing enzymes, drug uptake and efflux pumps, and transcriptional regulators
associated with processing and eliminating toxic chemicals from the body. The
xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes of phase I are cytochrome P450 enzymes involved
in the introduction of polar moieties via oxidation, reduction and hydrolysis; and the
phase II enzymes, such as glutathione S-transferase and UDP-­
glucuronosyltransferases, carry out the conjugation reactions.

Several food nutraceuticals play a pivotal role in modulating the activity of the
metabolizing enzymes or their receptors, either by inducing them resulting in

intense detoxification to eliminate the toxic substances, or by inhibiting the biotransformation of the xenobiotics into harmful cancer-causing agents that covalently attaches to the DNA resulting in DNA damage leading to the development of
cancer. Concurrently, the nutraceuticals play a dual role of inhibiting the formation
of carcinogenic DNA adduct formation by inhibiting the drug metabolizing phase I
enzymes; and conversely stimulating the phase II enzymes intending to eliminate
the toxic substances from the body preventing the initiation of cancers. Additionally,
the nutraceuticals play a critical role in improving the bioavailability of the drugs by
inhibiting some of the enzymes in liver and/or intestine.

In summary, this chapter reviews the current knowledge on the potential of several dietary phytochemicals in the prevention of health conditions related to the
xenobiotic induced oxidative stress and injury resulting in adverse health complications such as inflammation and cancers.

###### **1 Introduction**


P. Paul et al.


The field of nutrition study in the cancer process is quite vast, and it is becoming
evident as research progresses that nutrition is a contributing factor in cancer.
Research on nutrition and cancer prevention has sought to comprehend how particular foods and nutrients affect cancer-related pathways. The role of nutrition in
the development of cancer was nevertheless supported in the latter part of the twentieth century by probing research and new epidemiological data (Martín Ortega
and Segura Campos 2021). Doll and Peto forecasted in a 1981 paper titled “The
Causes of Cancer” that nutrition was responsible for about 35% of cancer cases
worldwide. Diet, nutrition, and bodily activity are key factors influencing the
chances of developing cancer, owing to their links to obesity, a proven risk factor
for many cancers (Mayne et al. 2016). Diet is a critical element influencing growth
factor levels and other aspects of cell growth and can impact the genesis and progression of cancers in various ways. Several epidemiologic research studies have
repeatedly associated a greater intake of plant-origin foods, including whole grains,
vegetables, fruits, legumes, seeds, nuts, and tea, with a lower risk of acquiring different malignancies. Inadequate protein consumption is linked to lower IGF-1
(insulin-like growth factor 1) levels and lower cancer mortality, especially in the
elderly. IGF-1 is required by normal cells for proliferative signaling. Yet, in the
context of cancer, IGF-1 not only promotes cancer development via cell proliferation pathways but also inhibits cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Levine et al. 2014).
Inadequate vitamin D and calcium levels have also been associated with neoplastic
colonocyte suppression (Aggarwal et al. 2016), (Madak Erdogan 2017). The association between diet and malignancy has now been identified at the atomic, cellular, and functional levels, leading to significant scientific and technological
developments (Martín Ortega and Segura Campos 2021). The main objective of
this segment is to give the audience a synopsis of how important micronutrients
and macronutrients relate to preventing cancer.

###### **2 Macronutrients**


91


Macronutrients are the nutrients consumed by humans in larger quantities that supply energy. They comprise of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Elements including
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus make up the macronutrients and form the structural bases of tissues. Macronutrients are necessary for
substantial amounts to sustain body functioning and carry out daily tasks (Fellows
2009). The consumption of macronutrients influences the synthesis of numerous
hormones such as insulin, glucagon, cortisol, growth hormone, IGF-1, leptin, and
ghrelin. It is critical in regulating body functions and intracellular signaling mechanisms (Ranawana and Kaur 2013). The proportion of macronutrients in the consumed food can influence an individual’s hormonal condition and the cell function
of various tissues, boosting or inhibiting intracellular signal transduction pathways
that govern cell division and death. Disproportionate macronutrient intake has been
considered an essential axis in controlling the development of several illnesses,
including malignancy. The mechanisms of different macronutrients in cancer prevention have been summarized in Fig. 4.1.
###### ***2.1 Proteins***

Protein comes from the Greek word “proteios,” which implies ‘prime’ or ‘primary’
implying that protein is a vital tissue component in humans and animals; hence, this
phrase applies to nutrition (Reeds et al. 2000). A protein typically includes several

amino acids bonded by peptide bonds. Dietary protein provides little nutritional
benefit unless it has been metabolized to amino acids, di or tripeptides, in the small
intestines by peptidases and proteases. Thus, the nutritive worth of dietary protein is
established by its amount, digestibility factors, and relative proportions of amino
acids. These digestive products are either ingested by specialized cells that form the
small intestine known as ‘enterocytes’ or utilized by bacteria. Amino acids that do
not hydrolyze in the small gut reach circulation and are used for the biosynthesis of
proteins in all body tissues (Wu 2016). Amino acids act as precursors in forming
important biological substances like dopamine, serotonin, insulin, growth hormone,
creatine, glutathione, albumin, immunoglobulins, DNA, and RNA (Wu 2009; Li
et al. 2007).

Protein deficit causes metabolic diseases, kwashiorkor (induced by an extreme
protein shortage), and marasmus (generated by a serious energy and protein shortage) in humans, notably in several developing-country youngsters (Leser 2013).
Moderate insufficiency of dietary protein exists in the elderly, especially in developed nations, making them more vulnerable to metabolic and opportunistic disorders (Dasgupta et al. 2005). On the opposite end of the nutrition spectrum, excessive
dietary amino acids, protein intake through meals, and heavy supplementation damage human health, particularly in individuals with renal or hepatic impairment. It is
critical to comprehend how proteins regulate the generation of various hormones
and how amino acids control processes within the cell. As a result, this segment
outlines the key mechanisms that alter proteins and amino acids resulting from their
metabolism in the gastrointestinal tract (Hoffer and Bistrian 2012).

**2.1.1 Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1(IGF-1)**

IGF-1, a peptide hormone, is an important growth and metabolism regulator that
accelerates mitosis and suppresses apoptosis in nearly all mammal tissues. IGF-1
production and release occur from the liver, although it is produced locally in
numerous tissues. IGF-binding proteins and acid-labile subunits regulate circulating
IGF-1, whereas IGF-1 production and secretion are controlled by hormones such as
growth hormone, insulin, and dietary status (Firth and Baxter 2002; Gannon and
Nuttall 2011; Berryman et al. 2008; Savage 2013). Protein intake is a significant
nutritional component in regulating the production and release of IGF-1, which is
why it is vital in regulating cell growth, including malignancies. High amounts of
IGF-1 in blood have been shown by *in vitro*, preclinical and clinical studies to accelerate tumor development, indicating that it is among the major variables to monitor
in carcinoma patients (Key 2011). Protein-rich diets can elevate blood IGF-1 concentrations, whereas appropriate or minimal protein ingestion keeps levels low and
raises levels of IGF-1 inhibitory proteins, such as IGF binding proteins and acid-­
labile subunit, decreasing IGF-1 tissue supply. Several observational epidemiological investigations have established an association between blood IGF-1
concentrations and the chances of breast cancer (BC) in females, prostate cancer
(PROC) in males, and colorectal carcinoma (CRC) (Savage 2013; Yin et al. 2018).

**2.1.2 Insulin**


93


Pancreatic β-cells release insulin which is primarily responsible for glucose homeostasis. Protein ingestion, on the other hand, regulates the release of this hormone.
Insulin is crucial in regulating protein and energy metabolism, boosting energy storage, and triggering muscle protein synthesis, among other things. Furthermore,
insulin can increase cell growth. Insulin operates on various cells via insulin receptors (Ranawana and Kaur 2013; Taniguchi et al. 2006). Due to the ability of the
insulin receptor to drive cell proliferation, pathological diseases like cancer and
cardiovascular disorders can arise due to this functional mechanism in hyperinsulinemic circumstances. It has been discovered that insulin receptors are overexpressed
in cancer cells, showing that elevated insulin levels can stimulate tumor mitogenesis
(Vigneri et al. 2016). Proteins’ capacity to increase the release of this hormone is
determined by their amino acid profile, with animal sources having the highest
potential to do so when opposed to plant-origin protein. Consumption of protein of
plant origin has also been shown to lessen insulin resistance, lowering insulin levels
and can be beneficial to cancer patients (Chen et al. 2018).

**2.1.3 Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) Signaling Cascade**

A serine-threonine protein kinase, mTOR functions as a major controller of cell
growth, replication, and viability in normal cells concerning dietary patterns, growth
factors, and stress responses. It is critical to maintaining the equilibrium between
cell growth and cell death based on cellular conditions and needs. Several dysregulations of this mechanism have been linked to various pathological conditions,
including cancer (Hsieh et al. 2012). However, abnormally active mTOR in tumor
cells provides signals stimulating tumor cells to proliferate, spread, and infect new
healthy organs (Hsieh et al. 2012; Zou et al. 2020). mTORC1 and mTORC2 are
physiologically and biochemically different complexes of mTOR. mTORC1 governs cell development and metabolism, whereas mTORC2 regulates the survival and
proliferation of cells. Furthermore, several investigations have revealed that malignancies frequently overactivate the AKT/mTOR signaling cascade (Zou et al. 2020).

Different growth factors, like insulin and IGF-1, along with amino acids and
glycogen, influence mTOR activation. Given that protein ingestion raises blood levels of insulin, IGF-1, and amino acids, it also serves as a major inducer of the mTOR
protein. This pathway is heavily influenced by protein ingestion. Certain amino
acids, such as leucine and arginine, present in greater concentrations in animal
sources, have been identified as the primary activators. As a result, proteins derived
from plants with lower levels of leucine and arginine are less efficient in mTOR
pathway activation, protein production, and cell proliferation; this is a crucial aspect
concerning cancer patients (McCarty 2011). Various newly discovered mTOR
inhibitors (rapamycin, temsirolimus, and everolimus) have entered clinical studies
in recent years. Also, it has been shown that certain medications work well when
combined with mTOR inhibitors (Zou et al. 2020).

**2.1.4 Protein Intake Recommendation**


P. Paul et al.


While establishing a protein recommendation, it is necessary to evaluate the person’s present status, physical activity, and goals. As a result, the examination and
advice of a skilled health expert are critical in managing disorders like cancer.
According to epidemiological research, a recommended daily protein intake for
adults with little physical activity will be 0.7–0.8 g/kg to minimize cancer risk.
Protein consumption within this range is associated with a decreased risk of cancer
death because of low plasma IGF-1 levels (Martín Ortega and Segura Campos 2021).
###### ***2.2 Carbohydrates***

Carbohydrates are an essential macronutrient found in certain foods and drinks.
They serve as the principal energy source, engage in blood glucose homeostasis and
insulin metabolism, contribute to cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism, and aid
in colon bacterial fermentation. Based primarily on their molecular makeup and
level of polymerization, carbohydrates are further divided into simple and complex.
Fewer than two sugar molecules make up simple carbohydrates, which are rapidly
digested and turned into energy and cause a surge in blood glucose levels. Two or
more sugar molecules make up complex carbohydrates that are digested and altered
slowly compared to simple carbohydrates. Indigestible complex carbohydrates
(also known as dietary fibers) contribute to bacterial growth and fermentation in the
gut microflora (Maino Vieytes et al. 2019; Zeng 2014).

Carbohydrate digestion starts in the mouth, where they are broken down by salivary amylase into monosaccharides which are absorbed into the systemic circulation. It results in the elevation of blood glucose levels which stimulates the pancreatic
β-cells to release insulin that directs the body’s cells to take up sugar for storage or
energy, whereas the surplus undergoes metabolism to synthesize cholesterol, fatty
acids (FAs), and triglycerides. When blood glucose levels drop, the pancreatic
α-cells generate glucagon, and the adrenals release cortisol. It encourages hepatic
gluconeogenesis (glucose synthesis) and glycogenolysis (glycogen breakdown) to
release stored glucose.

Based on the quantity and kind, ingested carbohydrate consumption has been
suggested to influence cancer risk (Maino Vieytes et al. 2019). Carbohydrates have
a wide range of impacts at the cellular, physiological, and ecological levels and their
primary role as energy substrates. Among them are bacterial, epigenetic, endocrine,
and systemic changes caused by their ingestion, which may impact the risk of developing cancer (Leturque et al. 2012). This section describes the biological pathways
via which carbohydrates may be involved in cancer.

4 Nutraceuticals in the Prevention of Cancer

**2.2.1 Glucose Metabolism and the Warburg Effect**


95


The oxidative breakdown of the bonds of carbon in glucose, which is the main macronutrient, allows for the generation of energy in the form of ATP (mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation). This process is essential to the continuing existence of
all living things. After all of the glucose has been completely oxidized by mitochondrial respiration, the end product in mammals may be lactate or CO 2 . In cancer cells
and other normal proliferating cells, the glucose absorption rate increases drastically, and lactate is generated despite the availability of oxygen and perfectly functional mitochondria. This event, called the Warburg Effect, has been intensively
studied. Yet, after careful examination, it is clear that its benefits for cell development and survival are not yet fully understood (Liberti and Locasale 2016; van der
Heiden et al. 2009). Because carbohydrate is the principal macronutrient absorbed
by tumor cells, this effect has raised various concerns concerning the quantity of
carbohydrate cancer patients should ingest. Thus, different theories have been
developed using very low carbohydrate or ketogenic diets to cause a cellular metabolic shift in which FAs and ketone bodies become the primary energy source (van
der Heiden et al. 2009; Talib et al. 2021).

**2.2.2 Insulin**

As noted in the previous section on proteins, carbohydrates greatly impact insulin
levels since they are an important factor influencing a patient’s hormonal condition
and hence in modulating cell signaling, including cancer cells. Carcinogenesis and
the transition to aerobic glycolysis are thought to result from insulin receptor amplification in tumor cells caused by elevated blood sugar, insulin, and inflammatory
cytokines (Makarem et al. 2018). Tumor suppressor gene mutations that affect the
insulin receptor signaling cascade promote insulin receptor sensitivity and activity.
It suggests that higher glucose and insulin concentrations in the tumor microhabitat
may promote cell viability instead of cell death in DNA-damaged cells. Several
investigations have discovered a link involving high blood sugar and hyperinsulinemia and tumor formation (Vigneri et al. 2016, 2020; Maino Vieytes et al. 2019).
Carbohydrate restriction has been demonstrated to produce metabolic and hormonal
changes. Restricting carbohydrate consumption can reduce mTOR system activation via another energy-detecting mechanism controlled by AMP-activated protein
kinase (AMPK). AMPK activation and phosphorylation depend on the intracellular
ratio of AMP to ATP, which is influenced by glucose and glycogen levels. Under
carbohydrate restriction, insulin levels fall while glucagon levels rise (Weber
et al. 2020).

**2.2.3 Dietary Fiber, Gut Microflora, and Short-Chain Fatty**
**Acids (SCFAs)**


P. Paul et al.


Dietary fibers comprise nondigestible plant substances that travel through the gut
and resist enzymatic action (Zeng 2014). They can bind to nutrients forming new
metabolites and regulating the disposition of nutrients. Dietary fibers comprise cellulose, lignin, pectins, oligosaccharides, and gums. Upon anaerobic fermentation in
the GI tract, some nutritional fibers produce SCFAs, that have health benefits
(Dhingra et al. 2012). It is helpful to modify the gut microflora by favoring the
development of strains of useful bacteria such as the bifidobacterial. These bacteria
reduce gut inflammation, elevate gastrointestinal transit rate and curb pathogenic
strains’ development (Vivarelli et al. 2019). Numerous investigations have demonstrated that consuming a diet rich in dietary fibers positively influences the GI
microflora and substantially reduces the possibility of CRC. This phenomenon is
the result of higher fecal matter production, reduced accumulation and exposure to
cancer-causing substances, decrease in pathogenic bacteria promoting gut inflammation, lowering the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), proinflammatory
cytokines (Interleukin-6), high growth of beneficial bacteria having immunomodulatory and anticancer properties and increased synthesis of SCFAs (Maino Vieytes
et al. 2019; Zeng 2014; Vivarelli et al. 2019; Kuo 2013).

Anaerobic fermentation of complex carbohydrates and undigested fiber leads to
forming SCFAs (Matthews et al. 2012). A higher possibility of CRC is correlated
with changes in the GI microflora due to decreased synthesis of SCFAs. Epithelial
cells lining the GI lumen rapidly and efficiently take up the SCFAs. Three main
SCFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) are employed by colonic cells for energy
production, in contrast to mutated CRC cells that utilize aerobic glycolysis for
energy generation. CRC cells are more susceptible to SCFAs than normal colon
cells, indicating that they play a significant part in cell homeostasis. Modifying
SCFA concentrations in the gut via microflora alterations has been identified as a
possible therapeutic or preventive method for CRC. Over the previous few decades,
there has been an increase in fascination with figuring out how SCFAs work in the
cells of CRC (Gomes et al. 2020).

Acetate accounts for approximately 60%–75% of the total SCFAs and is synthesized by several colonic microbes (van der Beek et al. 2017). Crypt cell multiplication is triggered by acetate which decreases the contraction rate of longitudinally
oriented colonic smooth muscles. Also, it improves blood flow in the colon, augments ilial motility, lowers adipogenesis and modifies the immune system of the
host by associating with the G protein-linked receptor in adipocytes and cells of the
immune system (Brown et al. 2003; Hong et al. 2005). Acetate has also demonstrated the capacity to reduce nuclear factor (NF)-κB, TNF-α, and IL-6 that are
induced by lipopolysaccharide, as well as to promote the formation of peripheral
blood antibodies in a variety of tissues (Tedelind et al. 2007).

Similar to acetate, propionate has a concentration-dependent effect on the pace
at which longitudinally oriented muscle contractions occur via enteric neurons in

97


the terminal rat colon (Ono et al. 2004). In human and animal studies, propionate
has demonstrated the ability to minimize food consumption and enhance satiety
through leptin, a satiety hormone, and G protein-linked receptor activations (Xiong
et al. 2004; Samuel et al. 2008). Propionate could also be anti-carcinogenic as it
lowers the proliferation of human CRC cells and differentiation by histone protein
hyperacetylation and activation of apoptosis (Jan et al. 2002; Hinnebusch et al.
2002). Additionally, propionate inhibits the tissue synthesis of proinflammatory
cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, NF-κB) (Al-Lahham et al. 2010; Zapolska-Downar and
Naruszewicz 2009).

Among SCFAs, butyrate is the most important to sustain colonic health and regulate cell proliferation and multiplication (Macfarlane and Macfarlane 2011).
Butyrate oxidation has a role in the consumption of oxygen of over 70% in isolated
colon cells. Butyric acid absorption and consumption by the colonic epithelium has
been exhibited in an investigation of the concentration of SCFAs in arterial and
portal circulation as well as in the colon’s contents (Cummings et al. 1987).
Butyrates display stronger anti-inflammatory characteristics in contrast to acetate
and propionate. This phenomenon is likely arbitrated by suppressing the TNF-α
generation, NF-κB stimulation, and expression of interleukins in cells of the immune
system and colon (Bailón et al. 2010; Lührs et al. 2002).

SCFAs favor the proliferation of normal colonic cells while exhibiting growth
inhibition of most CRC cells, producing cell cycle interruption and apoptosis induction by complicated cellular pathways. Substantial *in vitro* research has demonstrated that butyric acid suppresses histone deacetylacetylase enzymes and permits
hyperacetylation of histone, which results in elevated gene transcription of cyclin
D3 and p21/Cip1 genes (Waldecker et al. 2008). Furthermore, butyric acid limits
cancer cell migration and invasion by increasing antimetastasis gene activation and
preventing pro-metastatic gene activation (Waldecker et al. 2008).

**2.2.4 Carbohydrate Intake Recommendation**

It is well understood that excessive sugar consumption elevates the risk of various
pathological conditions, including cancer. In contrast, a diet rich in complex carbohydrates can substantially decrease cancer risk. Thus, it is sensible to limit sugar
consumption and increase the ingestion of vegetables, whole grains, and fruits to
limit the possibility of malignancy and other ailments (Sieri et al. 2017).

The ketogenic diet has been extensively studied. It limits carbohydrate intake to
the point where it causes the body to enter ketosis, a state brought on by increased
fat oxidation and ketone body production that drives cells to change how they use
energy. The ketogenic diet can create metabolically unfavorable conditions for cancer cells. Hence, it could be a potential supplement to a multifactorial cancer therapy tailored to each patient. Several preclinical and clinical investigations have
yielded positive and neutral outcomes. The likelihood that it may function in some
circumstances supports using the ketogenic diet in conjunction with established

therapy (Leturque et al. 2012; Hagihara et al. 2020). Nonetheless, it is crucial to
remember that every form of cancer is unique, and patients frequently have comorbidities, so a thorough evaluation of the patient is required. Regarding disease management, a diet rich in complex carbohydrates and fiber is unquestionably beneficial,
as is reducing sugar consumption (Maino Vieytes et al. 2019; Sieri et al. 2017).
###### ***2.3 Lipids***

Lipids are a class of substances that are immiscible in water but miscible in organic
solvents and comprise sterols, FAs, sphingolipids, phospholipids, terpenes, and others (Fahy et al. 2011). Lipids carry out numerous biological functions, such as constructing cell membranes, energy storage, participating in signaling pathways,
functioning as hormones and secondary messengers, maintenance of electrochemical gradients, and membrane anchoring. Lipid homeostasis is essential for health,
and lipid deficiencies are important in the etiology of serious and deadly disorders
(Watson 2006; Oresic et al. 2008). This section will examine FAs because they are
the main lipids classified as macronutrients because of their higher proportion in
food and energy supply.

Lipid breakdown commences in the buccal cavity when subjected to lingual
lipases released by salivary glands to initiate the digestion of triacylglycerides.
Digestion in the stomach proceeds due to the influence of both gastric and lingual
enzymes. The peristalsis in the stomach contributes to the emulsifying process of
lipid-soluble vitamins and dietary fat. Crude lipid emulsions in fine lipid droplets
approach the duodenum and subsequently interact with pancreatic juice and bile,
undergoing significant chemical and physical changes in the intestine emulsification
proceeds with micellization and hydrolysis in readiness for absorption in the gut.
Pancreatic juice and bile contain pancreatic bile salts, lipase, and colipase, which
are crucial in ensuring the efficiency of breakdown and absorption of lipids. Free
FAs from the gut lumen are absorbed by enterocytes which use them to produce
neutral fats (Iqbal and Hussain 2009).

Dietary fats have long been thought to be involved in cancer genesis. Research
has linked high fat intake to BC, CRC, PANC, and PROC. However, this discovery
is no longer acknowledged because the carcinogenic properties of fat are not dependent on caloric quantity but only on the type and quantity of fat ingested. Thus, the
following segment will focus on the importance of the important FAs types controlling the disorder.

Based on the double bond count and the degree of unsaturation in their structure,
FAs can be classified into three major classes: saturated, monounsaturated, and
polyunsaturated, which are further categorized as ω-3 FAs and ω-6 FAs. They play
important parts in regulating cellular functions that could either cause or prevent
cancer (Fahy et al. 2011).

4 Nutraceuticals in the Prevention of Cancer

**2.3.1 Fatty Acids Supply for Membrane Synthesis in Cancer**


99


Cell development and proliferation, including that of malignant cell growth, requires
aggregation of substantial amounts of lipids for the production of cell organelles
and cell membranes. These lipids may be acquired either exogenously (via diet) or
synthesized endogenously via lipogenic pathways (Corn et al. 2020). As a result, the
cell membrane and organelle composition is heavily influenced by the amount and
type of fats ingested, as well as their synthesis endogenously, which is primarily
mediated by an excess of carbohydrates, the metabolism of which improves the
citrate availability and thus its production (Bojková et al. 2020). Recent investigations have demonstrated that tumors of several kinds absorb FAs from systemic
circulation similarly to normal cells, which proves the significance of FAs.

Excessive lipid buildup or changes in saturated and unsaturated fatty acid levels
might disturb homeostasis and increase cellular stress (Corn et al. 2020). Saturated
fatty acids (SFAs) levels in tumor tissues are greater than in healthy tissues in malignancies of the breast, lung, prostate, endometrium, ovary, bladder, and colon
(Forman and Mahabir 2010). Tumor cell membranes containing a larger proportion
of SFAs have been associated with more aggressive tumors. It renders them highly
resistant to apoptosis induction, whereas a greater rate of unsaturated FAs has been
connected to a better response to tumor prevention and apoptosis. However, greater
SFAs levels in the membrane diminish its fluidity, motility, and invasiveness while
increasing the membrane’s viability (Bojková et al. 2020; Chen and Huang 2019).

**2.3.2 Palmitic Acid (PA)**

PA is the most frequently researched SFAs in connection with cancer. Among SFAs,
PA is found most abundantly in humans and is either procured from diet or generated from endogenous substances like FAs, carbohydrates, and amino acids. In
membrane phospholipids and adipose triacylglycerol, PA makes about 20–30% of
total FAs.

To comprehend the contribution of fat in cancer, there is a need to clarify the
function of FAs in signal transduction pathways regulating cell growth. The research
interest in this domain is growing with an emphasis on the role of PA in carcinogenesis. It is known that PA participates in intracellular signal transduction and plays a
part in carcinogenesis and other conditions, including neurodegenerative, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, and inflammation (Fatima et al. 2019). PA
contributes to S-palmitoylation, a process in which PA-protein conjugation occurs
via a thioester bond and catalyzes 23Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC)-family palmitoyl
S-acyltransferases. In contrast, PA elimination is caused by acyl-protein thioesterases. Palmitoylation controls the function of various proteins involved in homeostasis, such as the G protein-linked receptor. Palmitoylation’s disruption of protein
function is associated with metabolic and neuronal disorders and cancer (Fatima
et al. 2019; Ko and Dixon 2018; Conibear and Davis 2010). Palmitoylation is vital
in the functioning of both tumor suppressors and oncogenes (Lin et al. 2017a).

invasiveness through the TLR-4/ROS/NF-B/matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)
signaling cascade and accelerated proliferation in many oral cancer cell lines
expressing large amounts of clusters of differentiation (Binker-Cosen et al. 2017).
Whereas PA inhibited growth, impeded metastasis and inhibited hepatocarcinoma
cell proliferation *in vitro* and mouse xenograft models, suppressed mTOR, lowered
membrane fluidity, and disrupted glucose metabolism (Lin et al. 2017b). Effects on
PA in human studies showed inconsistency displaying a positive relationship
between dietary PA and BC (Sczaniecka et al. 2012). However, another investigation described a detrimental relationship between PA consumption and the possibility of PANC (Nkondjock et al. 2005).

**2.3.3 Monounsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFAs)**

The chemical structure of MUFAs shows a single unsaturation. Among these, oleic
acid is found most abundantly in the diet, comprising more than 20% of all FAs in
several oils and fats, with the most abundant in olive oil. Preclinical findings on the
impact of oleic acid on tumor formation and progression are inconsistent. Oleic acid
increased the growth of BC cell lines i.e., MCF-7 cells (Gastón et al. 2017). But
when human BC cell lines: BT-474 and SK-Br3 were subjected to oleic acid,
HER-2/neu expression was suppressed (Menendez et al. 2005). Upon treatment
with oleic acid, gastric cancer cell lines AGS and MKN-45 exhibited improved
invasiveness through PI3K-Akt signaling cascade activation. As per a prospective
cohort study, increased MUFAs consumption reduced the chances of digestive cancers (Sellem et al. 2019). In contrast, another investigation reported an elevated
PROC risk with a higher MUFAs intake (Liss et al. 2019).

The comprehensive experimental data demonstrated a growth-promoting influence of oleic acid on tumor cells. However, a meta-analysis of case-control studies
exhibited that olive oil lowered the chances of developing BC, tumors of the digestive system, and others. Olive oil’s protective action against cancer could be attributed to compounds other than oleic acids, such as polyphenols, triterpenes, and
other antioxidant substances (Psaltopoulou et al. 2011), (Sánchez-Quesada
et al. 2013).

**2.3.4 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs)**

The chemical structure of PUFAs shows the presence of multiple double bonds.
Two main classes of biologically important PUFAs are ω-3 PUFAs, and ω-6 PUFAs,
differentiated based on the double bond location. Linoleic acid (LA) and arachidonic acid (ARA) are examples of ω-6 PUFAs, while α-linolenic acid (ALA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are examples of ω-3
PUFAs (Michalak et al. 2016). LA and ALA are important as they are the precursors

101


of ARA, EPA, and DHA, all of which contribute to body homeostasis (Saini and
Keum 2018). PUFAs participate in regulating many intracellular pathways, such as
the production of inflammatory mediators (eicosanoids), lipid biosynthesis, gluconeogenesis, and cell proliferation (Michalak et al. 2016; Jump 2011; Madsen et al.
2005; Ntambi and Bené 2001). Generally, ARA is a pro-inflammatory eicosanoid
precursor. In contrast, EPA and DHA are anti-inflammatory eicosanoid precursors.
Still, the interplay of ω-6 and ω-3 FAs and their lipid mediators in the setting of
inflammation are complicated and remain unknown (Calder 2010; Innes and Calder
2018). Hence, sustaining a low ω-6/ω-3 ratio is important for decreasing inflammation, which contributes to several chronic disorders (DiNicolantonio and O’Keefe
2018). The advocated ratio of ω-6 to ω-3 is 4:1 (Simopoulos 2008). Thus, this ratio’s
differences can contribute to carcinogenesis (Lee et al. 2007; Stanford et al. 1995).

PUFAs regulate tumor cells through various processes, including regulation of
tumor microhabitat, expression of genes and cell signaling systems, and alteration
of the membrane phospholipid profile (Gu et al. 2015; Berquin et al. 2008).

2.3.4.1 ω-3 PUFAs

Epidemiological research has suggested that ω-3 PUFAs possess a cancer-­protective
role, whereas ω-6 PUFAs promote cancer. DHA uniquely influences membrane
configuration and is regarded as the primary ω-3 PUFA in preventing cancer
(Siddiqui et al. 2011). A study demonstrated that DHA obstructed the growth in
MCF-7 cells through pAKT signaling (Huang et al. 2017). DHA resulted in apoptosis of PANC cells through suppression of the STAT3/ NF-κB -cyclin D1/survivin
axis (Park et al. 2018). In mice with 4 T1 mammary tumor implants, ω-3 PUFAs-­
enriched diet reduced growth and development while augmenting apoptosis and
tumor penetration by immune cells (Khadge et al. 2018). *In vitro* and *in vivo* investigations also revealed that DHA integration in cell membranes enhanced the
absorption and activity of cytotoxic drugs (Siddiqui et al. 2011). Ingestion of long-­
chain ω-3 PUFAs was linked with a lowered probability of endometrial carcinoma,
particularly in women with normal Quetelet’s index (Brasky et al. 2015).

2.3.4.2 ω-6 PUFAs

*In vitro,* research produced conflicting outcomes on the influence of ω-6 PUFAs in
carcinogenesis. LA and ARA lowered cell proliferation and survival in PROC cell
lines: C4–2 cells and PC-3 cells (Bratton et al. 2019). Whereas, ALA increased
MDA-MB-231 BC cell metastasis; the reported mechanism included overexpression of fascin, phospholipase D, and PI3K/Akt pathway activation (Serna-Marquez
et al. 2017; Gonzalez-Reyes et al. 2018; Diaz-Aragon et al. 2019). *In vivo* studies
showed growth-promoting effects of ω-6 PUFAs in tumors. ω-6 fats-enriched diet
accelerated PANC proliferation in KRAS transgenic mice (Cheon et al. 2011). A
systematic review of prospective cohort trials published in 2016 found no

P. Paul et al.


correlation between ω-6 PUFAs ingestion and the possibility of BC (Cao et al.
2016) However, a recent study found that consumption of a higher ω-3/ω-6 ratio is
linked with a reduced possibility of BC in Asia than in the West (Nindrea et al. 2019).

**2.3.5 Lipid Intake Recommendation**

According to epidemiological, *in vivo*, and human data, a low-fat diet (<20% total
energy) is the preferred choice to considerably lower cancer risk. The makeup of the
ingested FAs is crucial, so intake of ω-3 fat sources such as salmon, tuna, walnuts,
and ω-3 supplements should be prioritized. Olive oil consumption has demonstrated
a lesser probability of all kinds of cancer. Saturated fat ingestion of red meat pork
should be minimized (Bojková et al. 2020).
###### **3 Micronutrients**

Micronutrients are dietary components such as vitamins and trace elements that are
impossible for humans or other vertebrates to synthesize. The body requires only
micro- or milligram amounts of these substances to carry out diverse biochemical
pathways and metabolic processes (Shergill-Bonner 2017). An inadequate supply of
micronutrients leads to disease. A micronutrient‘s abundance or lack in the body is
determined by the amount and type of food consumed and its use in biochemical
reactions. When a diet is inadequate, macronutrients and micronutrients can be
depleted or reduced, affecting various organic and metabolic functions, the immune
system, and tolerance to treatment (Shenkin 2006; Johnson 2004). Cancer patients
often neglect micronutrients due to dietary restrictions. The nutritional status of
patients with cancer is highly correlated with their treatment success and healing
process, with micronutrients playing an essential role described in Table 4.1. Many
epidemiological studies have reported micronutrients‘significance as supportive of
nutrition treatment and that multivitamins and minerals can improve disease diagnosis and patient quality of life (Gröber et al. 2016). A recent study found that,
based on the kind and stage of cancer, 30–90% of patients with cancer lack micronutrients. The presence of micronutrient deficiencies associated with cancer and
treatment affects the progression of the illness and the efficacy of cytoreductive
measures, along with the growing danger of complications (e.g., decreased immunity, depression, hindered injury recovery, and tiredness). To maintain immune stability, the patient must receive a sufficient supply of immune-improving
micronutrients, such as vitamin D and selenium (Madiyal et al. 2016; Irimie
et al. 2019).

###### ***3.1 Vitamin A (Vit A)***


P. Paul et al.


A lipid-soluble micronutrient, Vit A cannot be produced by the human body and
must be consumed through diet. Fish oils, milk products, eggs, milk, and green
leafy vegetables are rich in Vit A (Zinder et al. 2019). It is present in different forms,
such as retinol, retinaldehyde, retinoic acid and carotenoids. It regulates methylation and cell growth, protecting against free radicals and DNA damage. Various
biological processes are controlled by retinoid compounds, such as the development
of an embryo, eyesight, differentiation, formation of bone, metabolic processes,
hematogenesis, apoptosis, proliferation, and reproduction. Furthermore, Vit A suppresses tumorogenesis in the prostate, breast, skin, lung, mouth, and bladder.

4 Nutraceuticals in the Prevention of Cancer


105


There is a significant relationship between the progress of cancer and deficiency
of Vit A has been proven by several epidemiological studies in recent years (Poulain
et al. 2009). Ligand-activated transcription factors and nuclear retinoid receptors are
also responsible for modulating epithelial differentiation and proliferation; retinoids
reverse carcinogenesis through complex mechanisms (Smith and Saba 2005;
Fontana and Rishi 2002; Maia et al. 2019). Increased Vit A consumption from fruits,
vegetables, and fiber protects against pharyngeal and oral cancer, according to several studies (Chi et al. 2015; Kune et al. 1993). However, a greater intake of Vit A
was linked in multiple studies to an augmented risk of cancer. Compared to most
β-carotene supplements, a meta-analysis of many trials revealed a small increase in
cancer incidence correlated with Vit A use (Huang et al. 2016). Eun et al. reported
that Vit A prevents the proliferation of CRC cells without using retinoic acid receptors (Eun et al. 2007). Retinol consumption has a considerably reduced risk of melanoma than Vit A or β-carotene consumption, according to a meta-analysis study
(Maalmi et al. 2018).
###### ***3.2 Vitamin B1/Thiamine (Vit B1)***

It is regarded as a necessary aqueous-soluble vitamin that promotes glucose metabolism. It is an integral component of cellular metabolism, which is needed for the
activity of the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, and transketolase, α-ketoglutarate
dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, which is involved in the pentose phosphate cycle. These enzymes catalyze amino acids. In addition to being naturally
obtained in various foods, thiamine is also used to fortify a range of processed
foods, including meat, milk bread, legumes, eggs, and fish. Early in the twenty-first
century, there was a theory that excessive Vit B1 intake contributed to cancer development because it is an essential component of cellular metabolism (Liu et al. 2018;
Wu and Lu 2012). According to research on BC cell lines, thiamine at higher concentrations promoted cell progress while inhibiting proliferation in PANC and neuroblastoma cancer cell lines. Patients with cancer are more likely to lack Vit B1
because chemotherapeutic treatments can deplete this vitamin, and tumor consumption depletes other tissues (Hanberry et al. 2014; Peterson et al. 2020).
Epidemiological studies have shown that elevated dosages of Vit B1 for 24 hours
reduced BC cell division and growth (Liu et al. 2018). ***3.3 Vitamin B9/Folate and Folic Acid (Vit B9)***

It is a B-complex vitamin that is water soluble and works in single-carbon transfer
processes. Folic acid is a highly stable and oxidized form of folate. It is obtained
from shellfish, salmon, whole grains, dark leafy vegetables, asparagus, poultry,
beans, citrus fruits and dairy products. It is crucial for controlling gene expression

by participating in DNA synthesis and methylation and also enhances immune function and maintains DNA integrity. Additionally, it plays a vital role in synthesizing
proteins, nucleic acids, nerve cells, and blood cells. Numerous epidemiological
studies found a link between folate inadequacy and malignancies, neural tube
abnormalities, and atherosclerosis (Saghiri et al. 2017; Farhan Aslam et al. 2017),
(Naderi and House 2018).

Folate deficiency can alter DNA methylation and disrupt genome integrity and
DNA repair processes. Additionally, it alters S-adenosylmethionine levels, which
decreases the action of important oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (Verma
2016). According to epidemiological research, overconsumption of folate may help
prevent ovarian cancer (OVC) (Zhang et al. 2012) and BC risks, especially for those
who consume more alcohol (Chen et al. 2014), CRC (Dulai et al. 2016), and
PROC. Several folic acid-conjugated nanoparticles have been shown to enhance
antitumor activity in lung cancer (LC) patients (Zhao et al. 2017). A meta-analysis
study that involved a large patient cohort of Chinese people and a patient cohort of
Egyptians demonstrated that dietary folate and vitamin B6 exhibited protection
against nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Galeone et al. 2015), (Zeng et al. 2016). Some
controversial literature data suggest that folic acid contributes to cancer progression
in some cases. Several meta-analyses showed that folic acid administration for up to
6 years did not shield people with previously resected adenomas from developing in
the large intestine. Further research is required because there is insufficient proof
that adenomas are linked to an enhanced possibility of developing cancer. Folic acid
has been therapeutically used in many combinations to avoid CRC and chemotherapy side effects.
###### ***3.4 Vitamin B12/Cyanocobalamin (Vit B12)***

Vit B12 is an aqueous-soluble molecule consisting of a corrin ring and a cobalt ion
in the center. The primary sources of Vit B12 are shellfish, meat, milk, fish, and eggs
(Watanabe 2007). The function of Vit B12 is to synthesize DNA, produce cellular
energy, process fatty acids, catabolize amino acids, and methylate proteins to prevent the accumulation of homocysteine. A diet that contains few animal foods or has
malabsorption issues frequently results in Vit B12 deficiencies. Those who consume
less meat or have restricted nutritional patterns are also at risk of Vit B12 deficiency.
Lack of Vit B12 causes weakness, fatigue, and anemia. Thus we consume foods
containing Vit B12 every day or take supplements including Vit B12 (O’Leary and
Samman 2010).

Several studies showed the connection between cancer and low plasma Vit B12
concentrations; also, some studies demonstrated a link between higher plasma
cobalamin levels and an increased possibility of cancer (Wu et al. 2019; Collin
2013). According to some studies, patients with high cobalamin levels have a higher
risk of hematological and solid tumors (Carmel et al. n.d.). According to the research

107


by Campbel et al., Vit B12 helps prevent and treat unfavorable musculoskeletal
outcomes associated with BC. In addition, Vit B12 supplementation is crucial for
avoiding its deficiency in various cancer types, including gastric cancer, as its
absorption can be hampered by surgical incisions of the stomach (Kim et al. 2011).
According to Fanidi et al., high Vit B12 concentrations are linked with a greater
threat of LC, and for every doubling of Vit B12, the risk increases by 15% (Fanidi
et al. 2019). Maintaining enough blood concentrations of vitamins within an acceptable range is advised since either a vitamin deficit or excess might raise the chance
of developing cancer. Therefore, it would be best to consume the daily required
amount (2.4 mcg) to prevent illness.
###### ***3.5 Vitamin C/Ascorbic Acid (Vit C)***

It is also called ascorbic acid, an important micronutrient that should be provided by
the food or as a supplement. It comprises six-carbon lactone, naturally functional,
effortlessly convertible, and a reduced form and oxidized forms like dehydroascorbic acid in ascorbate. Mammalian livers produce it, but not human beings, non-­
humans, or rodents (Granger and Eck 2018). When exposed to acidic environments
and extreme temperatures, it easily oxidizes and degrades. In addition to citrus fruits
and peppers, strawberries, tomatoes, broccoli, sprouts, and Indian gooseberries are
all good sources of Vit C. It has been suggested that the daily required amount of Vit
C is 90 mg for males and 75 mg for females (Doseděl et al. 2021; Li and Schellhorn
2007; Kaźmierczak-Barańska et al. 2020).

Oxidative processes and free radicals are responsible for initiating and promoting cancer. The antioxidant properties of ascorbic acid may inhibit some of these
processes. Furthermore, ascorbic acid inhibits the development of carcinogenic
nitrosamines by acting as a nitrite trap (Chambial et al. 2013; Pawlowska et al.
2019). As part of the immune system, it maintains the proper number of T lymphocytes and natural killer cells that fight tumors. It has been shown that Vit C significantly lowers the chances of cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, atherosclerosis,
Parkinson’s disease, and toxicity due to metal in humans (Johnson et al. 2003). As a
preventive agent for cancer, Vit C stimulates the immune response, produces collagen, inhibits enzymes that cause metastasis, and stops the spread of cancer-causing
viruses. Besides reducing chemotherapy harmfulness and avoiding oxidative stress,
it enhances chemotherapy efficiency, neutralizes some carcinogens, and facilitates
injury recovery in cancer patients (Li and Schellhorn 2007; Cimmino et al. 2018).
In case-control studies, epidemiological research revealed a substantial inverse connection between the intake of Vit C and preventing PANC (Hua et al. 2016). Luo
et al. dose-response study showed that increasing Vit C intake by 100 mg/day lowers the chance of developing LC by 7%. It suggests that Vit C may be effective in
avoiding LC (Luo et al. 2014).


-----

108
###### ***3.6 Vitamin D (Vit D)***


P. Paul et al.


Vit D contains two lipid-soluble compounds, cholecalciferol (D3) and ergocalciferol (D2), and their metabolites are regarded as essential for human health. Meat,
eggs, dairy and fish are dietary sources of Vit D3, while ultraviolet-irradiated fungi
and yeast are Vit D2 (Hohman et al. 2011). Humans produce Vit D3 when exposed
to ultraviolet light, a precursor to endocrine hormones. It maintains a healthy skeleton of humans by sustaining an adequate supply of calcium and phosphorus
(Wacker and Holick 2013; Severo et al. 2009).

Several types of cancer linked to Vit D deficiency have been recently recognized
and are receiving considerable attention. Vit D has many biological functions contributing to cancer prevention that have only recently been realized. It has been
found that the absence of Vit D rises the hazard of certain types of cancer. Some
epidemiological studies indicate that a lack of Vit D contributes to yearly premature
deaths from OVC, CRC, PROC, and BC (Garland et al. 2006; Holick 2014).

It has been demonstrated that 1,25-dihydroxy Vit D3, a Vit D metabolite, reduces
the proliferation of tumor cells with Vit D receptors. It controls the entire process of
tumorigenesis, from initiation to metastatic spread and interactions between cells
and their microenvironment. It regulates several cell behaviors, including apoptosis,
differentiation, proliferation, autophagy, and epithelial–epithelial-mesenchymal, as
well as inflammation, antioxidants, angiogenesis and immune responses in the
microenvironment. Researchers found a highly significant connection involving
plasma Vit D concentration and a reduced risk of CRC in epidemiological studies.
The greatest reductions in CRC incidents and mortality were seen in subjects with
Vit D concentrations of more than 29 ng/mL. Another study by Dovnik et al. stated
that optimal Vit D levels reduce cancer mortality and OVC risk. A study found that
natural and synthetic Vit D compounds could induce apoptosis in VDR+ cells in
oral precancerous lesions and oral squamous cell carcinomas (Chiang and
Chen 2009).
###### ***3.7 Vitamin E (Vit E)***

Vit E is a crucial lipid-soluble vitamin composed of four tocotrienols (α, β, γ, and δ)
and four tocopherols (α, β, γ, and δ) (Khadangi and Azzi 2019). Vit E can be
obtained from vegetables, meat, eggs, and cereals. The most prevalent and highly
functional type of Vit E that is found naturally in the environment is tocopherol; in
humans, it is the most prevalent type. Vit E intake recommended for adults is 15
milligrams, and for children, it is 5 milligrams (Sung et al. 2003). Vit E is a free-­
radical scavenger in cell membranes and inhibits DNA damage caused by carcinogens. Additionally, there is proof that a deficiency in Vit E might cause cancer,
Parkinson’s disease, cataracts, fibrocystic breast disease, heart disease, diabetes,
stroke, epilepsy and, Alzheimer’s disease (Pham and Plakogiannis 2005).


-----

4 Nutraceuticals in the Prevention of Cancer


109


Chemotherapy may benefit from the use of Vit E. Research in earlier times has
exhibited that Vit E in its different forms (γ and δ- tocotrienols) has anticancer
effects. Anticancer activity of α- tocopherol has been studied extensively due to the
contribution of free radical damage in carcinogenesis. There is a link between raised
cancer risk and low Vit E or nutritional deficiencies. Some meta-analysis studies
reported that supplementing α- tocopherol to populations with Vit E insufficiency
has beneficial effects in lowering the cancer risk (Yang et al. 2020; Jiang 2017;
Klein et al. 2003). The most effective anticancer effects belong to tocotrienols. They
focus on mutual molecular pathways that prevent cell division, invasion, metastasis,
autophagy, apoptosis, invasion, and metastasis. Protein kinase-C action, the growth
of smooth muscle cells, and tumorgenesis are all suppressed by α -tocopherol. In
cancer cell lines, Vit E activates the enzyme NADPH: quinone reductase and blocks
the breakdown of ARA and prostaglandins (Constantinou et al. 2008; Tucker and
Townsend 2005). Several epidemiological studies have shown no association with
CRC or a reduced risk of CRC when Vit E intake is increased (Wu et al. 2015;
Kristal et al. 2014; Malila et al. 2002). Another study showed that Vit E inhibited
mouse colon carcinogenesis by lowering inflammation, trapping reactive nitrogen
species, causing apoptosis and reducing free radicals (Ju et al. 2009).
###### ***3.8 Selenium (Se)***

A non-metallic trace element known as selenium is an important nutrient for human
health. Meat products, grains, and shellfish are the main dietary sources of Se; milk,
vegetables, and fruit have comparatively low quantities of Se. The selenoproteins
that execute the functions of Se, an essential trace element, include various oxidant
resistance enzymes. For several enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase and the
5 deiodinases, Se is required. Inorganic types of Se consumed as dietary supplements include selenite and selenate (Rayman 2020).

Recent research findings have shown that Se plays a substantial defensive function in reducing the growth of cancerous tumors. Depleted plasma Se levels are
linked to higher cancer-related illness and death. Se-metabolites inhibit cellular proliferation, enhance immune surveillance, suppress tumor neo-angiogenesis, enhance
apoptosis, and alter carcinogen metabolism (Letavayová et al. 2006; Gromadzińska
et al. 2008).

In numerous animal models featuring a dose-dependent response, sodium selenite and selenomethionine were reported to inhibit tumor development. In chemically stimulated carcinogenesis, selenite inhibits cancer cell proliferation more
potently than selenomethionine. Selenomethionine treatment was observed to
increase tissue selenium concentrations more than selenite supplementation (Combs
et al. 2001; Tinggi 2008). The activation of apoptosis and its impact on androgen
and estrogen receptor expression, suppression of protein kinase C activity and cell
growth, cell-cycle arrest, and DNA-repair genes are some potential anticancer

mechanisms of Se (Rayman 2005; Schrauzer 2000). Epidemiological data showed
a strong connection between the deficiency of Se and cancer risk, and Se supplementation reduced cancer risk (Peters and Takata 2008; Lee et al. 2011). A recent
case-control study (966 CRC cases and 966 matched controls) comprising 520,000
people in 10 Western European nations found indications that high levels of Se
reduce the incidence of CRC (Hughes et al. 2015) Se may have a prognostic function found that Se may play a prognostic role in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Chen
et al. 2016), BC (Zhang et al. 2013), and renal cancer (Ha et al. 2014) according to
several studies. Se successfully protects LC in persons with low selenium levels,
according to a study by Fritz et al. (2011).
###### ***3.9 Zinc (Zn)***

A trace element, Zn is vital for the normal functioning of human cells and involved
in many cellular and structural proteins, enzymes and transcription factors. Major
sources of Zn are seafood, poultry, and meats. Humans require trace amounts of Zn
in their diet, approximately 15 mg of Zn daily. Zn deficiency is associated with
growth retardation, hypogonadism, and brain dysfunctions. Besides improving cell-­
mediated immunity, Zn is also an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant (Santos et al.
2020; Prasad 2013).

Numerous studies have revealed the role of Zn in cancer. An increase in oxidative
stress and chronic inflammation may promote the progression of many cancers.
However, the exact mechanisms by which lack of Zn influences DNA integrity and
cancer danger remain unclear (Ho 2004; Prasad et al. 2009). The control of oxidative stress and cellular signaling processes is likely crucial for DNA repair and
apoptosis processes. The effects of Zn on apoptosis can be directly attributed to its
action on the nucleus or its direct action on mitochondrial apoptosis (Lee et al. 2004).

Zn homeostasis dysfunction was reported in several epidemiological studies to
be linked with PROC (To PK et al. 2020; Costello et al. 2004). Xie et al. found that
cervical cancer patients had lower Zn levels than healthy individuals, based on a
meta-analysis (Xie et al. 2018). In contrast to healthy controls, patients with head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma had lower plasma Zn levels and a considerably
greater copper: Zn ratio in the plasma, according to Abdulla et al. Additionally, it is
understood that Zn plays a significant part in the initiation and advancement of
PROC and may be used to prevent and treat the disease. In their study, Li et al. discovered that the consumption of Zn in the top category was associated with a lowered risk of PANC. It boosts immune system activity, inhibits free radicals, has a
genetic influence, and minimizes oxidative DNA damage to prevent PANC (Li and
Gai 2017).

4 Nutraceuticals in the Prevention of Cancer
###### ***3.10 Magnesium (Mg)***


111


Mg, the fourth most prevalent cation in humans, contributes to over 300 enzymatic
processes. Mg-rich foods contain grains, nuts, legumes, and green leafy vegetables.
Adults should consume between 300 and 400 milligrams of Mg daily. It functions
as a counter ion for the energetically dense ATP and nucleic acids, controls transmembrane transport, which is necessary for cell repair, RNA and DNA synthesis,
the stability of cell function, and upholds the cell’s antioxidant status. Additionally,
it is crucial to the functioning of the gastrointestinal and reproductive systems.
Numerous metabolic and inflammatory disorders, including cancer, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and hypertension
associated with Mg depletion. It is well established that consuming Mg can decrease
the risk of developing CRC considerably (Wark et al. 2012; Volpe 2013). As a cofactor for DNA restoration and duplication, Mg is important for apoptosis (Sahmoun
and Singh 2010), genomic stability, and the prevention of chemical carcinogenesis.
The interplay between cancer and Mg status is complicated. It has been found that
people and animals with Mg deficiency are more likely to develop tumors (Wolf
et al. 2009).

An analysis by Dana et al. found that Mg consumption under 300 mg/day may
reduce LC risk. LC incidence was not decreased by increasing Mg intake dosages
to >300 mg/d. The most Mg-consuming individuals have a much minor threat of
developing CRC later in life, according to several epidemiological studies (Qu et al.
2013; Chen et al. 2012). As a result of consuming less Mg, Dibaba et al. found a
24% rise in the danger of PANC (Dibaba et al. 2015) (Fig. 4.2).
###### **4 Conclusion**

Cancer is a multifaceted disease triggered via an interplay among environmental
and genetic aspects. Scientists have reported that dietary intake and nutritional supplements are important factors in cancer development. Evidence suggests that high
quality and quantity of dietary nutrients are linked to cancer occurrences and pathogenesis. Several dietary nutrients affect physiological, metabolic, and cellular signaling mechanisms associated with immune functions, thus influencing cancer
growth and progression. Deficiencies of nutrients in the diet are thought to influence
cancer development differently, but specific factors are still unknown. In the world,
obesity and alcohol are the two most important nutrition factors contributing to
cancer’s burden. A healthy diet rich in macronutrients and micronutrients is crucial
for preventing and treating cancer. Inadequate or excessive nutrients can contribute
to cancer risk and progress. Sustaining normal blood concentrations of nutrients is
a good approach for preventing and treating cancer; subsequently, this improves the
cells’ ability to function. Furthermore, physical activity, weight control, and proper
nutrition may improve survival and decrease the probability of cancer recurrence.

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose
level due to the defects in impaired insulin secretation and/or insulin responsiveness
(Craig et al. 2009). The prevelance of diabetes mellitus is getting increased worldwide especially developing areas where adopted Western life styles habits. In diabetes mellitus, blood glucose level can not be regulated and the type and duration of

diabetes affect the clinical phenotype of diabetes. (Mayer-Davis et al. 2017;
Galtier 2010).

Treatment approaches are variable depends on the classification of diabetes.
Although Diabetes mellitus can be classified into several types, each with distinct
causes, characteristics, and treatment approaches. The main types of diabetes as
proposed by American Diabetes Association is Type 1, Type 2, gestational diabetes
mellitus and specific types of diabetes due to other causes (American Diabetes 2021).

Type 1 Diabetes also known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or
juvenile-onset diabetes it results from an autoimmune response in which the body’s
immune system mistakenly destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas
(Saberzadeh-Ardestani et al. 2018). Therefore, the biomarker of Type 1 diabetes is
the presence of auto-antibodies against the pancreatic islet cells (Couper and
Donaghue 2009; Hameed et al. 2011). Consequently, insulin therapy is the main
therapeutic approach to regulate the blood glucose levels for individuals diagnosed
with Type 1 diabetes during their life (Dabelea et al. 2014). Although underlying
mechanism of autoimmune response has not been clarified yet, genetic and environmental factors have pivotal roles (Saberzadeh-Ardestani et al. 2018). In addition to
auto-antibodies, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region, play a significant role in
susceptibility to Type 1 diabetes. Variations in DR and DQ genes can affect immune
system regulation and increase the risk of developing the disease or leads to protection (Noble and Erlich 2012). During the autoimmune response, microenviroment
of the pancreatic cells have been changed and especially cytokines such as interleukin-­1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and
interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) are released. These cytokines, particularly contribute to
the destruction of beta cells and further inflammation within the pancreas (Lu et al.
2020). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are another main reason that lead to development of Type 1 diabetes. Inflammation triggers to generate ROS and contribute to
the damage of beta cells. Increased oxidative stress can impair the function and
survival of these cells, exacerbating the progression of Type 1 diabetes (Yaribeygi
et al. 2020).

Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes. Insulin resistance is a common pathological state in which insulin-target cells do not respond well to ordinary
levels of circulating insulin and this leads to increase blood glucose level and triggers the development of Type 2 diabetes (Brunetti et al. 2014). Genetics, poor diet
and obesity are the main factors in the development of Type 2 diabetes. At molecular level, chronic inflammation, ROS, celullar stress and lipid metabolism are the
main inducers in Type 2 diabetes development (Galicia-Garcia et al. 2020).

5 Nutraceuticals in Metabolic Syndrome and Diabetes

In Adipose tissue, particularly visceral adipose tissue, releases molecules known
as adipokines, including adiponectin and resistin, which can influence insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. In individuals with obesity, dysregulation of adipokine production can contribute to insulin resistance (Kim et al. 2019). During the
development of Type 2 diabetes, proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and
IL-6 and stress-induced MAPKs such as JNK and p38 MAPK inhibit the insulin
signaling and this inhibition supresses the translocation of glucose transporters to
the cellular membrane and impairs the glucose metabolism (Boura-Halfon and Zick
2009). Abnormal lipid metabolism, such as increased circulating free fatty acids and
triglycerides, can also contribute to insulin resistance and impaired insulin signaling. Lipid accumulation in non-adipose tissues, such as the liver and muscle, further
disrupts insulin action (Sears and Perry 2015).

Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy when hormonal changes impair
insulin action, leading to high blood glucose levels (Ogurtsova et al. 2017). It usually develops around the 24th to 28th week of pregnancy and affects approximately
2–10% of pregnant women (Egan et al. 2017). The risk of the complications are
increased by gestational diabetes for both the mother and the baby during pregnancy. However, with proper management, such as diet and exercise, blood glucose
levels can be controlled, reducing the risk of complications (Padayachee and
Coombes 2015).

There are other less common forms of diabetes is called as specific types. Latent
Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA) has common features of both Type 1 and
Type 2 diabetes. Initially, it may appear as Type 2 diabetes, but over time, individuals with LADA may require insulin therapy (Carlsson 2019). Maturity-Onset
Diabetes of the Young (MODY) is a rare form of diabetes that is often hereditary. It
typically develops in adolescence or early adulthood and mutations in the genes
which are responsible for the insulin production are the main cause of MODY
(Ellard et al. 2008).
###### ***1.2 Complications of Diabetes***

Classical chronic complications such as diabetic kidney disease, retinopathy,
peripheral neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, and coronary heart disease are frequently seen in patients with diabetes. In addition to these, complications such as infections, functional dysability, cancer, liver diseases, and cognitive
disability can be seen as emerging complications (Tomic et al. 2022) (Fig. 5.1).

**1.2.1 Diabetic Retinopathy**

Diabetes mellitus (DM) and its complications have become a public health issue
over the world. Increased permeability of retinal capillaries, edema, loss of the
blood-retina barrier and choroidal neovascularization stimulated by hyperglycemia
play an important role in the development of diabetic retinopathy. In diabetic

retinopathy patients, these changes manifest themselves clinically as microaneurysms, exudates and cotton wool spots and this stage of the disease is classified as
nonproliferative retinopathy. If retinopathy cannot be detected at this stage and the
necessary treatment approaches are not applied, the disease may progress to the
stage of proliferative retinopathy with the development of neovascularization which
manifest itself as a macular edema (Georgiou and Prokopiou 2023). inflammation,
cell death, advanced glycosylation endproducts (AGEs), free radicals, polyol and
hexamine pathways, activation of protein kinase C (PKC), reactive oxygen species
(ROS), growth factors, chemokines, and proangiogenic Vascular Endothelial
Growth Factor (VEGF) plays important roles in the pathophysiology of the DR
(Saha et al. 2023; Invernizzi et al. 2023). Diabetic retinopathy is an important health
problem seen in patients with diabetes, resulting in vision loss and blindness, and is
seen in approximately 3–40% of patients with diabetes (Tan and Wong 2022).

**1.2.2 Diabetic Nephrophathy**

Diabetic nephropathy is a condition seen in patients with diabetes and causes proteinuric and nonproteinuric end stage renal disease and diabetic kidney disease
(Pillai and Fulmali 2023). Chronic kidney disease, characterized by a decrease in
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and/or albuminuria, occurs in approximately 25–40% of diabetic patients. Studies conducted to elucidate the mechanisms
involved in the emergence of diabetic nephropathy; polyol pathway, oxidative
stress, chronical inflammation, fibrosis, advanced glycation end-products (AGEs),
protein kinase C (PKC) pathway, transforming growth factor -β (TGF-β) pathway,
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), SGLT2 cotransporter expression,
Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway and autophagy pathways show that they play an important role in the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy (Pelle et al. 2022). Disorders in these pathways

cause histological disorders such as glomerular injury, tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis, arteriolar hyalinosis, loss of the glycocalyx and loss of the endothelial surface layer in the kidneys (Tuttle et al. 2022).

**1.2.3 Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy**

Diabetes can cause peripheral neuropathies such as DPN, autonomic neuropathy,
radiculoplexus neuropathy, radiculopathy, and mononeuropathy, the most common
of which is diabetic peripheral neuropathy (Elafros et al. 2022). Diabetic peripheral
neuropathy characterized by axonal loss, neural demyelination and neuronal death
is a condition that occurs with the destruction of peripheral nerves and causes clinical findings such as pain, loss of sensation, prickling, burning, and electric shock-­
like sensations in the hands and feet in patients and has an increased risk for foot
ulcers and foot amputations (Eid et al. 2023; Pang et al. 2023). Although the incidence of peripheral neuropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes
varies, its incidence increases with age and disease duration. It has been shown that
processes such as inflammatory process, blood–nerve barrier (BNB) disruption,
reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, Advanced
Glycation End Products, reduction in mitochondrial ATP production, autoimmunity, Polyol pathway, Wnt pathway, Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and mTOR pathway play a role in the development of diabetic peripheral
neuropathy (Galiero et al. 2023; Sanaye and Kavishwar 2023).

**1.2.4 Cardiovascular Complications**

Diabetes causes cardiovascular complications such as coronary artery disease, cardiac autonomic neuropathy and diabetic cardiomyopathy. These complications are
the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes (Pan
et al. 2023). Diabetic cardiomyopathy is seen in approximately 12% of patients with
diabetes (Hao and Liu 2023). While left ventricle hypertrophy, increased atrial filling pressure, myocardial stiffness, and left ventricle diastolic dysfunction with preserved ejection fraction (>50%) are observed in patients with early-stage diabetic
cardiomyopathy, increased cardiac fibrosis, systolic and diastolic dysfunctions with
reduced ejection fraction (<50%) are observed in advanced stages) findings are
observed (Abdel Rhman and Owira 2022). Factors such as expansion of epicardial
adipose tissue, cardiomyocyte apoptosis and necrosis, microvascular dysfunction,
endothelial damage, insulin resistance, dysregulated Ca + methabolism, inflammation, fibrosis, overproduction of extracellular matrix proteins, non-­enzymatic formation of AGEs, oxidative stress, Nf-KB signaling, RAAS, aldosterone activity,
play an important role in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy (Phang
et al. 2023).

**1.2.5 Peripheral Arterial Disease**


C. Hangul et al.


Peripheral arterial disease is one of the atherosclerotic complications of diabetes
and is characterized by narrowing and occlusion of the arteries due to fatty deposits.
Peripheral arterial disease increases the risk for myocardial infarction and stroke.
Factors such as inflammation, advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), oxidatively modified LDLs, NO signaling, vasoconscrtuction, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia, thrombosis, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and mitochondrial
dysfunction play an important role in the pathogenesis of peripheral arterial disease
(Yadav et al. 2023). Clinical findings such as intermittent claudication, rest pain,
ischaemia, ulcer and toe gangrene might be observed in diabetic patients with
peripheral arterial disease (Zia Ur and Ram 2023). There are studies showing that
the incidence of peripheral arterial disease in individuals with diabetes is between
20% and 50% (Liarakos et al. 2023).

**1.2.6 Connection Between Oxidative Stress and Diabetes**

It is generally agreed today that cellular oxidative stress mechanisms, such as
reduction-­oxidation (redox) imbalances in the cell, produce reactive free radicals
that can damage cells and tissues and are the most important effects in the differentiation process between disease and homeostasis. Recent studies have explores
more complete understanding interaction among oxidative stress and nutraceuticals
in Metabolic Syndrome and Diabetes. Oxidative stress interferes with regulatory
pathways involved in insulin resistance and T-cell dysfunction, auto-oxidation of
glucose, increased the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which
contributes to the etiology of diabetes and metabolic syndrome exacerbates the
pathophysiology and consequences. But the precise mechanism is still unknown.
Dyslipidemia, inflammation, and hyperglycemia are all associated with T2D and
high OS. Excess ROS interacts with the cysteine residues (known as redox sensors)
and causes their oxidation, functioning as a second messenger and controlling the
function of key proteins such as Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), protein kinase C (PKC), and IB kinase (Fatima et al. 2023; Singh et al. 2009). Oxidative
stress may occur a pivotal role in the development of complications in diabetes such
as lens cataracts, nephropathy, and neuropathy (Bartlett and Eperjesi 2008). Millions
of obese and diabetic people are largely due to own change in lifestyle to one of
sedentary behavior and enormous industrialization, with access to foods and beverages high in energy, fat, sugar, or a mix of these (Nolan et al. 2011).

With this background, the central question that motivates this paper is to bring
perspective to the comparison among nutraceuticals in diabetes and metabolic syndrome. In this chapter, we want to evaluate the molecular and systemic roles of
nutraceuticals and how their effects on both oxidative stress and endothelial func
tion could help prevent or delay the onset of vascular-related type 2 diabetes
complications.

Endogenous antioxidants and nutraceuticals, which include the enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, as well as the non-­
enzymatic antioxidants glutathione, thioredoxin, and peroxiredoxins, help maintain
oxidative status by delaying, inhibiting, or preventing oxidation by scavenging free
radicals (Halliwell 2011; Erejuwa et al. 2012).

Due to their antioxidant action, medicinal plants are extremely effective in the
treatment of several diseases. All components of medicinal plants are useful in the
discovery of new types of drugs and in the treatment of sickness. Due to their phytoconstituents, plants are a possible source of hypoglycemic medications (Rahimi
et al. 2005).

Nutraceutials are substances able to slow or inhibit the oxidation of other mole
cules. Recently, the medical community has concentrated on using antioxidant
treatments to treat many illnesses, particularly diabetes. Previous experimental
investigations and clinical trials have revealed that antioxidants are effective at
reducing complications from diabetes. The treatment approach makes use of synthetic antioxidants, combined drugs, and drugs with antioxidant activity. Generally
speaking, medicinal herbs with antioxidant activity are taken into consideration for
the treatment of type 2 diabetes (Kelly 1998).

Diets high in bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols may play a role in the
prevention and treatment of several diseases thanks to its antioxidant, antiinflammatory, antimicrobial, hypoglycemic, and antineoplastic action. Polyphenols are an
important group of bioactive substances that occur naturally and are divided into
two major groups: non-flavonoids and flavonoids. All these biological and pharmacological activities are due to the peculiar chemical structure of flavonoid which is
capable to have a great number of molecular targets. Regarding flavonoid effects the
hypoglycemic one was examined (Gouveia et al. 2022).

Mediterranean diet is rich in polyphenols, which have been suggested as a possible treatment for Metabolic syndrome (Finicelli et al. 2019; Sohrab et al. 2018).
Over 8000 different bioactive plant components are classified into two primary categories of polyphenols: non-flavonoids and flavonoids. The flavonoids include flavonols, anthocyanidins, anthocyanins, isoflavones, flavones, flavanols (or
cathechins), flavanones, and flavanonols. The nonflavonoids include phenolic acids,
stilbenes, and lignans (Lecour and Lamont 2011).

Benzo-pyrone compounds called flavonoids have two phenolic rings and a pyran
ring. Variable pharmacological effects are produced by varied arrangements of
hydroxyl (-OH), methoxy (-OCH3), and glycosidic side groups and conjugations
among the rings A and B. Tannins and other composite species are produced when
this nuclear structure is polymerized, aiding its antioxidant effect (Gonzales
et al. 2015).

Gouveia et al. suggested that found evidence from the studies it included that
flavonoids, when taken alone as supplements, can dramatically alter a number of
metabolic parameters and hence lower the risk of disorders connected to the metabolic syndrome. It is pointed that only theaflavin and catechin, out of all the examined flavonoids, were unable to change metabolic parameters; however, only one
study used these substances (Gouveia et al. 2022). Catechins effect diabetes via

decreasing adipocyte differentiation and proliferation, lipogenesis and lipid absorption, lowering plasma triglyceride, free fatty acid, cholesterol, glucose, insulin and
leptin levels, as well as increasing fatty acid β-oxidation and thermogenesis (Kawser
Hossain et al. 2016).

The potential therapeutic uses of flavonoids for a variety of illnesses, including
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and Alzheimer’s, have been examined. In
the near future, further experimental and clinical research will be required to confirm the true therapeutic value of flavonoids. Results from both in vitro and in vivo
studies strongly suggest that flavonoids increase glucose tolerance and improve
insulin sensitivity, which may have a positive impact on insulin resistance (Zhou
et al. 2023). Flavonoid-rich diets are advised for maintaining beneficial health and
wellbeing and preventing diabetes, obesity, cardio-vascular illnesses, and neurodegenerative disorders due to their strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory qualities.
In addition to interacting with the insulin-related signaling system, flavonoids’ biological anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties also contribute to their potential to reduce IR. Numerous scientific studies have demonstrated that flavonoids
may play a role in metabolic pathways that relate to glucose metabolism (Fogacci
et al. n.d.).

A series of phosphorylation processes are triggered when the ligands for these
receptors activate insulin resistance. And by recruiting and activating PI3K, which
phosphorylates the serine/threonine residue of protein kinase B (Akt), irs1 promotes
the PI3K-Akt pathway. Through AS160, Akt controls how GLUT4 is transported to
the cell surface. When AGE binds to its receptor RAGE, a number of signaling cascades, including JNK, NF-B, and PKC activation, are activated, which reduces the
effectiveness of the insulin signal (Khalid et al. 2021). Consuming a high-calorie
diet may lead to an insulin and glucose imbalance and the emergence of diseases
associated with lifestyle, such as diabetes and CVD. However, regular ingestion of
polyphenols such as resveratrol may reduce plasma glucose levels linked to
improved insulin activity and suppress cancer (Baur et al. 2006).

The capacity of metabolic and vascular stressors to induce cellular oxidative
stress and impair mitochondrial function is one common cause of injury in diabetes
(Vinik 1999; Russell et al. 2002). This theory has been validated by recent research
that has measured the oxidative stress in sensory neurons both in vivo and in vitro
as well as the antioxidant protection of the neurons. When 10–20 mm glucose is
applied in vitro to dorsal root ganglion neurons, O2 and H2O2 are produced, which
results in lipid oxidation and cell death. IGF-I prevents this glucose-induced mortality in part by reducing ROS generation (Russell et al. 1999).

Nonetheless; hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia have been emphasized that to
increase ROS production by oxidative stress, providing to the development of insulin resistance, altered endothelial dysfunction and energy metabolism, and the
appearance of vascular complications (Oguntibeju 2019; Okon et al. 2007). An
imbalance between antioxidant defense systems such as CAT and SOD enzymes
and the production of ROS contributes to the probability of oxidative stress formation in diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome. In this sense, in various oxidative
stress-related disorders, an increase in ROS production and/or a reduced ability to

remove the excess ROS are connected with a decrease in plasma antioxidant enzyme
activity, resulting in oxidative damage (Rizzo et al. 2012). The recommended mechanisms leading to insulin resistance include the accumulation of certain lipid mediators, abnormal features of mitochondrial function, an increase in stress-activated
protein c-Jun-N-terminal-kinase (JNK), and inflammatory pathways (Masenga
et al. 2023). During diabetes, the hexose monophosphate (HMP)/glycolysis pathways are redirected to provide energy where the amount of glucose entering the
cells is minimal, generating oxidative stress (Abdel-Raheem et al. 2022). Oxidative
stress is considered crosstalk between these mechanisms is associated to imbalance

in glucose homeostasis and can lead to the diabetes-associated insulin-resistance
status plays a vital role in the onset and change of this condition (Ashish et al. 2020).
###### **2 Phytochemicals and Diabetes** ***2.1 Properties of Phytochemicals***

Phytochemical is a combination of the Greek words ‘phyto’ meaning plant and
‘chemical’. Phytochemicals; They are non-nutrient bioactive components that are
also involved in reducing the risk of chronic diseases, beyond providing the desired
health benefits with nutrition (Liu 2004). These compounds are non-nutritive substances produced by plants through primary and secondary metabolism for survival.
Phytochemicals that give color, odor and taste properties to plants; it also protects
plants from herbivores, insects, etc. provides protection (Molyneux et al. 2007).

Phytochemicals with nutraceutical properties found in food. It has been shown to
be of great importance due to its beneficial effects on human health (Thakur et al.
2020). It has been noted that dietary phytochemicals differ greatly in the composition of various fruits, vegetables, and grains and often have complementary mechanisms. Therefore, it is recommended to diversify the phytochemical sources
throughout the day to obtain the highest health benefits (Bellik et al. 2012).

Isolated from fruit, vegetables, cereals; There are more than 5000 identified phytochemicals and much of it still remains a mystery (Liu 2003).

For thousands of years, plants have been used as a primary source of medicine
(Veeresham 2012). Studies conducted in recent years; It shows that phytochemicals
have positive effects on health by reducing the risk of chronic diseases by showing
effects such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anticarcinogenic,
immunomodulatory, cardioprotective (Demir and Akpınar 2020; Bahadoran
et al. 2015).

In general terms; Phytochemicals are thought to have the following effects
on health:

- Substrate for biochemical reactions

- Cofactors of enzymatic reactions

- Inhibitors of enzymatic reactions


-----

132


C. Hangul et al.



- Absorbents/chelants that bind to and remove unwanted components in the gut

- Ligands that agonize or antagonize cell surface or intracellular receptors

- Cleaners of reactive or toxic chemicals

- Compounds that increase the absorption and/or stability of essential nutrients

- Selective growth factors for beneficial stomach and intestinal bacteria

- Fermentation substrates for beneficial mouth, stomach or intestinal bacteria

- Selective inhibitors of harmful intestinal bacteria (Dillard and German 2000).

Drugs of phytochemical origin show multiple therapeutic effects by inhibiting
enzymes and hormones that activate many diseases, stimulating the DNA repair
mechanism, promoting the production of protective enzymes, inducing antioxidant
effect and strengthening immunity. The advantage of using medicinal plants for
treatment over synthetic drugs is their less side effects, high potency, less patient
toxicity, affordability and environmental friendliness. Secondary metabolites have
anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, antidiabetic, anti-obesity and immune-enhancing
properties. With these features, it has become inevitable for pharmaceutical technologies to use many active phytochemicals directly or by modifying them in the
development of active drug candidates (Pereira et al. 2012).
###### ***2.2 Types of Phytochemicals and Food Sources***

Phytochemicals, which are bioactive compounds and have potential health benefits,
are categorized according to the differences in their structure and functions
(Figs. 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, and 5.5) (Cojocneanu Petric et al. 2015). In this subsection, the
structures, classification and information on which foods contain phytochemicals
are presented.

**2.2.1 Polyphenols**

Structurally all polyphenols contain more than one phenol unit and a varying number of hydroxyl groups, while most polyphenols have at least one carbohydrate
(glycoside) attached to hydroxyl groups (Panickar 2013).

Polyphenols are divided into different groups according to the number and structure of phenol rings, as well as the number of structural elements attached to the
polyphenols, and foods usually contain polyphenols in different chemical forms as
complex mixtures (Lewandowska et al. 2016). Simple phenolic acids are basically
classified into two groups as hydroxybenzoic acid and hydroxycinnamic acid. While
hydroxybenzoic acids (p-hydroxybenzoic acid, protocatechuic acid, gallic acid) are
not of high nutritional interest because they are found in a few edible plants, the
other group (p-coumaric, caffeic and ferulic acids) is more common in foods
(Gonzalez-Castejon and Rodriguez-Casado 2011).

Phenolic acids such as caffeic acid, ferulic acid and coumaric acid are found in
high amounts in coffee, as well as in fruits such as blueberry, kiwi, apple, strawberry, blackberry and cherry (Manach et al. 2004).

Ferulic acid (4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid) is a phenolic compound found
in cereal bran, whole grain foods, citrus fruits, bananas, coffee, orange juice, eggplant, beets, cabbage, spinach, and broccoli (Zhao and Moghadasian 2008).

Stilbenes are a class of polyphenols found in several plant species that are of
great interest due to their complex structure and diverse biological activities, and the
best known example is resveratrol, while they are structurally divided into monomeric and oligomeric stilbenes (Shen et al. 2009).

While resveratrol is found in grapes, red wine, peanuts, and blueberries, its content in different sources varies widely depending on factors such as climate, fungal
infections, exposure to ultraviolet rays, and winemaking procedures (Signorelli and
Ghidoni 2005).

Curcuminoids are known as non-toxic yellow pigments naturally found in
Curcuma (turmeric) and Zingiber (ginger) species (Aggarwal 2010). Curcumin is
one of hundreds of compounds isolated from the spice turmeric and is currently

being studied extensively for its potential therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of
metabolic disorders associated with many diseases.

Lignans are a group of phytochemicals consisting of two phenylpropane units,
found in plants in glycoside form. The richest dietary sources of lignans include
flaxseed, secoisolariciresinol (>3.7 g/kg dry weight) and matairesinol, while this
amount is up to 1000 times higher than the dietary sources of the same lignans
found in other grains, some fruits and vegetables (Adlercreutz 2007). The lignans
identified in rye as more diverse than flaxseed are pinoresinol, lariciresinol, isolariciresinol, and syringaresinol (Bondia-Pons et al. 2009). When the lignans in the
structure of the plant are consumed, they are converted into enterolactone and
enterodiol, two mammalian lignans with various biological activities by the intestinal microflora (Adlercreutz 2007).

Flavonoids are a large family that includes more than ten thousands of different
phytochemicals with a common chemical structure, mainly consisting of 15 carbon
skeletons containing two phenyl rings and a heterocyclic ring, defined in plants,
especially fruits and vegetables (Kozlowska and Szostak-Wegierek 2014).

The first database for the flavonoid content of foods was established by the
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 2003, and today the content of
30 different flavonoids in approximately 2900 foods is obtained from this database
(Bhagwat et al. 2013). Flavonoids are divided into different subclasses according to
their chemical structure (see Fig. 5.2).

Flavonols are the most common flavonoids found in foods, and their main representatives are quercetin and campferol. It is usually found in relatively low concentrations of 15–30 mg/kg fresh weight, while its richest sources are onions, kale,
leeks, broccoli, and blueberries (Manach et al. 2004).

Flavanols are found in various teas, fruits, cocoa and chocolates in monomer
form (catechins) and polymer form (proanthocyanidins). The most common flavanols in fruit and cocoa are catechin and epicatechin; flavanols epicatechingallate
(ECG), gallocatechin, epigallocatechin (EGC), and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)
found in grapes, teas, and seeds of some leguminous plants (Kawser Hossain
et al. 2016).

Catechins are the main polyphenols in green tea and make up about 35% of the
dry weight (Manach et al. 2004). The anti-obesity potential of green tea catechins,
particularly EGCG, has been demonstrated in cell culture, animal, and human
studies.

Anthocyanins are compounds that dissolve in the epidermal cells of flowers and
fruits and are responsible for the pink, red, blue or purple color and dark fruits such
as strawberries, cherries, hawthorn, peaches, grapes, apples and plums, as well as
red onions, red radishes, black beans, eggplant and red found in cabbage (Manach
et al. 2004). Cyanidin has been shown to have the highest antioxidant activity (Wang
et al. 1997).

Flavones are mostly found in glycoside form in fruits and vegetables, and the
most important edible sources for which they have been analyzed are parsley and
celery (Manach et al. 2004). Luteolin and apigenin are the best-known flavones


-----

136


C. Hangul et al.


found in many edible plants such as carrots, peppers, celery, parsley and spinach
(Lopez-Lazaro 2009).

Since flavanones have a highly reactive structure, they are compounds that are
exposed to hydroxylation, glycosylation and O-methylation reactions in plants.
Edible plants such as tomatoes and mint are sources, and most importantly citrus
fruits, which contain high concentrations of flavanones. It exists in aglycon form,
including naringenin in grapefruit, hesperetin in orange, and eroodictiol in lemons
(Manach et al. 2004; Tanwar and Modgil 2012).

Isoflavones are flavonoids that are structurally similar to estrogens, although
they are not steroids, they have a hydroxyl group at 7 and 4′ positions similar to
the estradiol molecule and have pseudohormonal properties such as binding to
estrogen receptors. Isoflavones are mostly found in legumes, while soy and soy
products are the main source in the human diet. Genistein, daidzein, and glycine
are the most well-known isoflavones and exist in four forms: aglycone,
7-O-glycoside, 6’-O-acetyl-7-O-glycoside, and 6’-O-malonyl-7-O-glycoside
(Manach et al. 2004).

Capsaicin is one of the naturally occurring capsaicinoids in capsicum and is
responsible for the bitter taste. Since the worldwide consumption of spicy foods,
especially hot red pepper, is quite common, studies to determine the metabolic
effects of capsaicin and its derivatives are quite abundant (Reyes-Escogido Mde
et al. 2011).

**2.2.2 Terpenoids**

Terpenoids (isoprenoids) are a large family representing more than 4000 primary
and secondary metabolic compounds commonly found in plants. All terpenoids
have an isoprene unit in their structure and are divided into different groups according to the number of carbon atoms.

Carotenoids are fat-soluble tetraterpene pigments responsible for the red, orange,
yellow and green color produced by plants and some photosynthetic microorganisms. Although the main dietary sources are fruits and vegetables, they are also
found in bread, eggs and oils. While 600 carotenoids have been identified in nature,
only 50 are found in the human diet, and β carotene, α carotene, β cryptoxanthin,
lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin have been identified in serum. Carotenoids, are
divided into two as hydrocarbons (carotenes) and their oxygenated derivatives (xanthophylls); α carotene, β carotene, and β cryptoxanthin are known to be precursors
for vitamin A biosynthesis (Eggersdorfer and Wyss 2018).

Lycopene is a carotenoid mostly found in fruits such as tomatoes, capsicum,
watermelon and pink grapefruit, responsible for the red color whose bioavailability
is increased by heat treatment. It is known that it exhibits various mechanisms of
action, including inhibition of LDL cholesterol oxidation and lipid peroxidation,
with its strong antioxidant activity (Costa-Rodrigues et al. 2018).

**2.2.3 Organosulfides**


137


Organosulfur compounds are bioactive compounds found in abundance in Allium
plants such as garlic, onions, and leeks, which attract attention with their health
benefits as well as giving the distinctive flavor and aroma of vegetables. The best
known organosulfur compounds are allicin, allixin and allyl sulfides (Sahu 2002).

**2.2.4 Phytosterols**

Phytosterols are natural food components that are structurally similar to cholesterol.
These phytochemicals also include phytostanols, which are formed by the natural
hydrogenation of double bonds in phytosterols commonly found in nature, that is,
they do not contain double bonds in the sterane ring. While it can be found in esterified and free alcohol forms, food sources are known to be unrefined vegetable oils,
seeds, cereals, nuts and legumes. The most studied phytosterols are campesterol,
brasicasterol, stigmasterol and sitosterol.
###### ***2.3 Phytochemıcal Index***

Phytochemical index; it was introduced in 2002 by Mark F. McCarty with the proposal to determine the phytochemical content of the diet via an index. While suggesting this, McCarty stated that the concept of ‘glycemic load’, which characterizes
another feature of the diet, has been used in epidemiological studies in recent years,
and similarly, FI can help the researchers to characterize the phytochemical feature
of the diet and to associate this index with a healthy one. He also stated that it can
be used by nutritionists as a tool to determine the phytochemical content of individuals’ diets and to measure their development (McCarty 2004).

While calculating the phytochemical index, fruits with high phytochemical content, all vegetables except potatoes, legumes, whole grains and foods containing
whole grains, and oilseeds are taken as a basis. McCarty stated that although the
phytochemical content of fruit and vegetable juices does not contain fiber or the
phytochemical content is reduced by taking the crust, it is still rich in phytochemicals and that he can participate in the calculation. Similarly, he added that wine,
cider and beer would also be used in the calculation, but hard drinks should not be
included. He stated that soy protein should be added as it is a source of isoflavones,
extra virgin olive oil can also be taken, but other cooking oils should not be taken
because their phytochemical content per calorie is not rich enough. McCarty stated
that FI has some shortcomings. Because the calculation is mainly based on calorie
content, foods such as green tea, black tea, which have no calorie content but rich in
phytochemicals, cannot be used in the index. At the same time, he stated that since
phytochemicals in foods have different effects on health, they cannot be differentiated (McCarty 2004) The phytochemical index has been evaluated by very few

C. Hangul et al.


studies. The Glucose-Lipid Study in Iran often used the phytochemical index as a
parameter (Bahadoran et al. 2013a, b). However, since McCarty’s FI calculation
method could not include phytochemical rich foods such as spices and green tea in
the calculation, the FI was calculated as the daily consumption amount of phytochemical rich foods in grams instead of the calorie amount/daily calorie amount
from foods rich in phytochemical content. The total daily consumption was determined as the amount of food [FI = (foods rich in phytochemicals g/day/total food
intake g/day) × 100]. Thus, foods that could not be included in the group could be
taken. Bahadoran et al. while evaluating FI, the energy-adjusted phytochemical
index, which determines the FI per 1000 calories for each individual, was calculated
and evaluated according to the energy-adjusted FI. [(1000 kcal × FI)/daily calorie
intake of the individual] (Bahadoran et al. 2013b).
###### ***2.4 Relation of Phytochemicals to Diabetes***

A plethora of compounds can be classified as nutraceutical-phytochemicals in relation to the prevention and treatment of diabetes. In this section, diabetes and nutraceuticals will be discussed within the context of the phytochemicals summarised in
the previous section.

**2.4.1 Polyphenols**

As previously stated, polyphenols are categorised into two main groups: flavonoids
and non-flavonoids. Although flavonoids represent a large family, they share a common structural unit, the flavanic core. In contrast, the structures of non-flavonoids
are heterogeneous and vary considerably, resulting in the existence of numerous
subgroups (see Sect. 3). We will now examine the molecular mechanisms and clinical effects of these molecules on diabetes (Fig. 5.6).

Caffeic acid is a compound that has been shown to have a protective effect on
diabetic complications. It was found to be protective in cardiac tissue of diabetic
mice (Chao et al. 2009). Furthermore, in a human study, it was shown to improve
wound healing via mutiple pathways as Nf-kB and NOS (Romana-Souza et al.
2018). In a rat model of diabetic retinopathy, caffeic acid was found to decrease
oxidative stress in neurons and to increase neuronal survival (Fathalipour et al.
2019). In nephropathy, caffeic acid exerted a protective effect on the kidneys through
the modulation of autophagy and microRNA levels. (Matboli et al. 2017; Salem
et al. 2019).

In addition to caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid and ferulic acid, other phenolic acids
have been shown to regulate molecular targets in diabetes, with beneficial effects on
parameters such as B-cell protection, blood glucose level, hyperlipidaemia and diabetic complications (Li et al. 2022; Yan et al. 2020).

**Fig. 5.6** The two-dimensional biochemical structures of polyphenols that have been demonstrated
to be effective in the treatment of Type 2 DM. Obtained from PubChem (Luteolin 2024; Resveratrol
2024; Pelargonidin 2024; Caffeic 2024; Delphinidin 2024; Cyanidin 2024; Curcumin, 2024;
Hesperidin 2024; Capsaicin, 2024)

As a highly efficacious compound, numerous studies have been conducted at the
level of clinical trials on diabetes, investigating the potential of resveratrol as a
therapeutic agent. Resveratrol has been demonstrated to possess protective properties against end-organ damage and to reduce complications through pleotropic
effects on multiple tissues (Szkudelski and Szkudelska 2015) such as SIRT1 activation (Milne et al. 2007), attenuation of ROS related damage in the heart, kidneys and
liver (Mohammadshahi et al. 2014; Schmatz et al. 2012). To summarize, the beneficial effects of resveratrol extend beyond glucose-related pathways, such as insulin
sensitivity, GLUT4 translocation, and carbohydrate-related enzymes. Resveratrol
also exerts anti-inflammatory (e.g., IL-6 and TNF-alpha regulation) and anti-­
oxidative effects. These properties make resveratrol one of the most beneficial molecules for the treatment and prevention of diabetes, including end-organ damage
(Ozturk et al. 2017).

Curcumin is one of the most extensively researched biological compounds in the
context of diabetes. Curcumin regulates energy metabolism, it reduces the level of
intracellular lipids, suppresses angiogenesis necessary for growth in adipose tissue,
regulates transcription factors that play a key role in adipogenesis and lipogenesis
(Mohamed et al. 2014). Due to its low solubility and absorption, its bioavailability
is limited at normal intake. In traditional use, it is taken by heating with black pepper and olive oil, which has been shown to significantly enhance its bioavailability.
In order to achieve high bioavailability at the pharmaceutical level, nanotechnology

is used, with the creation of nanocurcumin materials, such as liposomes, micelles,
and nanoparticles. A study was conducted on rats in which diabetes was induced by
STZ. The results demonstrated that nano-form curcumin treatment had a positive
effect particularly in the pre-treatment group on C peptide levels and inflammatory
cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-6 (Bulboaca et al. 2019). In another study
when administered with coenzime q10 and curcumin together in a nanoparticle, it
helped to ameloriate diabetic complications (Devadasu et al. 2011). Numerous studies on curcumin and diabetes, along with a comprehensive reviews of the literature
(Quispe et al. 2022; Ghosh et al. 2015), has led to the conclusion that this compound
exerts a beneficial effect on diabetes and its associated complications .
Anthocyanins are thought to be protective against obesity and type 2 DM due to
their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and hypolipidemic activities (Guo and Ling
2015). It has been demonstrated that anthocyanidins, including cyanidin, delphinidin, and pelargonidin, exert a multitude of effects on various biological processes.
These include the modulation of GLUT receptors in skeletal and cardiac muscle, as
well as the regulation of blood sugar, insulin, and triglyceride levels (Li et al. 2015;
Nizamutdinova et al. 2009; Rojo et al. 2012; Sarikaphuti et al. 2013; Zhang
et al. 2012).

Cyanidin and its derivatives may have a protective effect on diabetes through
multiple molecular targets. Cyanidin can increase AMPKα phosphorilation (Tsuda
et al. 2004). Cyanidin-3-rutinoside have ability to inhibit α-glucosidase
(Adisakwattana et al. 2011). Cyanidin glycosides were found to be highly effective
pancreatic α-amylase inhibitors, they can additionally block intestinal
sucrose(Akkarachiyasit et al. 2010).

Flavone, flavanone, and flavonol derivatives have been directly linked to the protection against secondary neuronal changes in diabetic rats. In a systematic review,
is reported flavonols have an effect on, Type 2 DM and obesity, can affect many
biochemical signaling pathways, physiological and pathological processes, show
anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-proliferative properties, and improve endothelial function (Rangel-Huerta et al. 2015). Citrus flavonoids, a phytochemical in
this subgroup, has been reported to have anti-diabetic, lipid-lowering, anti-­
atherogenic activities (Kawser Hossain et al. 2016). Luteolin has been demonstrated
to improve cognitive decline (Liu et al. 2013), hesperidin has been shown to exert
antidepressant effects (El-Marasy et al. 2014), an extract of green tea has been
found to enhance spatio-temporal learning (Sharifzadeh et al. 2017), fisetin has
been observed to protect peripheral nerves through the modulation of the NF-kB
pathway (Sandireddy et al. 2016).

Some of the flavonol derivatives are more effective in regulating metabolism
directly. High-cocoa polyphenol-rich chocolate has been tested directly in humans.
In this study; HbA1C levels and trigliseryte levels decreased in addition to a decrease
in blood pressure (Rostami et al. 2015). It was observed that another flavonol, quercetin, protected B-islets from damage via a reduction oxidative stress (Coskun
et al. 2005).

Isoflavones are a family known with their strong radical-scavenging and antioxidative effects (Umeno et al. 2016). A meta-analysis revealed that isoflavones

modulate the lipid profile and prevent cardiovascular effects (Chi et al. 2016).
However, there was no discernible impact on the glucose profile, as evidenced by
the HbA1c, insulin and glucose levels. (Baranska et al. 2021; Ye et al. 2015; Liu
et al. 2010). Before reaching a definitive conclusion, it may be useful to keep in
mind the possibility that factors related to dose and duration of use come to the fore
in the meta-­analysis and that individual variation may be missed in the response to
nutraceuticals. Furthermore, clinical and *in vitro* studies provide evidence for the
effect of isoflavones on diabetes. In a study involving approximately 600 individuals with type 2 diabetes and 600 controls, Nyugen et al. demonstrated that isoflavone intake was associated with a significantly lowered risk of developing type 2
diabetes (Nguyen et al. 2017). There are molecular evidence in mice studies for
increased insulin sensivity, GLUT4 translocation, decreased IL-6 and TNF-alpha
levels, increased glucose uptake and increased B-cell survival (Fu et al. 2012; Cao
et al. 2013; Cheong et al. 2014). Depending on the estrogenic and antiestrogenic
activities of isoflavones, it has been reported that they may be protective against
obesity (Wang and Mazza 2002).

Capsaicin, when used topically at a concentration of 0.075% has been demonstrated to be an efficacious treatment for diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain
(Care 1992).

**2.4.2 Terpenoids**

Caretinoids are natural antioxidant compounds. Although no definite conclusions
can be drawn on its effects on diabetes, caretinoids were used both for the prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome/diabetes. It has been reported that daily
consumption of some terpenoids may be beneficial in the treatment of obesity-­
related metabolic disorders such as Type 2 DM, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance,
and metabolic syndrome (Goto et al. 2010). Dietary amounts and the caretionoid
levels in plasma had been correlated with insulin resistance and plasma glucose
concentrations. A study was conducted on 100 patients and 150 healthy controls,
with the objective of examining serum carotenoids. The results demonstrated that
retinol, α-carotene, and α-tocopherol exhibited similar levels, while β-carotene was
significantly higher in the healthy group and retinol binding protein (RBP) was
significantly higher in diabetics. (Abahusain et al. 1999). Furthermore, a reverse
correlation was observed between fasting blood glucose and serum β-carotene when
the entire group was examined (Abahusain et al. 1999). In a separate study, dietary
intake of carotenoids was found to be associated with glucose metabolism. An
inverse relationship between plasma glucose concentration and plasma α-tocopherol
levels was observed (Ylonen et al. 2003). Plasma α-tocopherol levels were also
found to be directly associated with 2 h plasma glucose levels (Ylonen et al. 2003).
Additionally, plasma β-carotene levels exhibited an inverse direction with insulin
resistance (Suzuki et al. 2002). In a single study, all serum carotenoids, including
α-carotene, β-carotene, cryptoxanthin, lutein/zeaxanthin, and lycopene, demonstrated a linear inverse correlation with fasting serum insulin following the adjustment of multiple dependent variables (Ford et al. 1999).

Astaxanthin, diminished serine phosphorilation levels of IRS and its downstream
PI3K-Akt pathway. It additionally modulated ezymes related to glucose metabolism. The aforementioned alterations have been demonstrated to enhance insulin

sensitivity in comparison to mice that have not undergone treatment (Bhuvaneswari
and Anuradha 2012). The glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) was observed to be translocated to skeletal muscle (Arunkumar et al. 2012). In comparison to other carotenoids, astaxanthin is the most prominent due to its antioxidant properties (Naguib
2000). It has been demonstrated that astaxanthin can affect not all, but part of the
ROS and inflammation-related molecules. COX2, ICAM-1 and iNOS were the
downregulated cytokines, while NF-kB demonstrated no change in the level of
expression (Park et al. 2015). Conversely, a different group of researchers observed
a reduction in NF-kB (Bhuvaneswari et al. 2014). The previous group, in which
diabetes-induced hepatotoxicity was prevented by astaxanthin and Corni Fructus,
demonstrated a reduction in AGEs. Additionally, astaxanthin demonstrated no effect
on hepatic and serum glucose levels, while Corni Fructus exhibited a reduction in
both (Park et al. 2015). Another outstanding feature of astaxantin is its protective
effect on diabetic nepropathy. Manabe and colleagues demonstrated that astaxanthin could prevent the production of ROS and pro-inflammatory cytokines that are
associated with diabetes (Manabe et al. 2008). The administration of astaxanthin to
rodents resulted in a reduction in the levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, thereby
preventing the development of kidney damage (Naito et al. 2004). The combination
of astaxanthin with different antioxidant groups can result in divergent effects. For
instance, the combination with α-tocopherol led to a reduction in oxidative stress in
rats, while the combination with ascorbic acid led to an increase in oxidative stress.
(Nakano et al. 2008).

Bixin was found to induce the activation of PPARγ and its target genes in adipocytes (Takahashi et al. 2009). In mice with a high-fat diet and obesity, the oral
administration of bixin demonstrated hepatoprotective and hypoglycaemic effects
(Pinzon-Garcia et al. 2018). The binding activity of bixin was found to be PPARγ-­
specific, as PPARα and PPARδ did not exhibit significant interaction. As an interesting data, despite bixin leading to hypoglycaemia, glucose levels were observed to
be high in the latter phases, similar to those observed in metformin-treated animals.
The destruction of Langerhans cells was also observed. (Keita et al. 2021). For this
reason, it is important to assess the long-term side effects of the aforementioned

treatment.

Crocin, the sole water-soluble carotenoid, was found to be effective in diabetic
rats. Crocin demonstrated a significant effect on serum glucose, glycation end products, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, HbA1c, microalbuminuria, and
insulin resistance (Shirali et al. 2013). Furthermore, Crocin has the potential to protect renal tissue through its antioxidative effect (Rajaei et al. 2013).

Crocetin, via the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) pathway, has been demonstrated to block insulin resistance induced by palmitate in adipocytes. (Yang
et al. 2010).

Lycopene has been demonstrated to regulate enzymes involved in the processing
of ROS. In rats, administration of lycopene has been shown to increase the activity

of catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase enzymes, resulting in
a reduction in lipid peroxidation of the serum compartment (Ali and Agha 2009).
Another study depicted similar change in plasma while tissue lipid peroxidation
remain unaltered (Duzguner et al. 2008). In rats with diabetes mellitus treated with
lycopene, biochemical kidney parameters, including urea and creatinine, were
found to decrease. This suggests that lycopene may play a protective role in the
development of nephropathy (Li et al. 2014).

The research demonstrated that fucoxanthin and its converted form, fucoxanthinol, suppressed PPARγ and blocked adipocyte differentiation (Maeda et al. 2006).
Fucoxanthin can promote expression of GLUT4 mRNA in skeletal muscles in mice.
This compound also lead observable clinical improvements in body weight, in addition to hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and hyperleptinemia (Maeda et al. 2009).

**2.4.3 Organosulphides**

The administration of allyl methyl sulfide has been demonstrated to be highly effective in the treatment of diabetes in rats subjected to streptozotocin (STZ) treatment.
This compound has been shown to regulate blood glucose levels and to reduce the
production of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-alpha, IL-6 and
NF-kB. Furthermore, it has been observed to improve liver function, particularly
with a decline in oxidative stress (Sujithra et al. 2018). A recent study tested the in
silico drug properties of organosulphides and one of the aniline compounds, which
was found to be a drug-like ligand with no toxicity and to be more active than metformin, an antidiabetic agent (Rajalakshmi et al. 2021). Garlic as being an organosuphur containing food, suggested as a potential therapeutic option in diabetic
retinopathy. Different types of garlic preparetes as extract, raw extract, aged extract,
garlic oil, or combination with metformin have been applied on diabetes *in vitro* and
*in vivo* . The results demonstrated that these substances elevated insulin levels and

insulin sensitivity,and reduced blood glucose levels (Sanie-Jahromi et al. 2023).

**2.4.4 Phytosterols**

This group of compounds is related to glucose, lipid metabolism and insulin resistance. It has been reported that these compounds mechanically compete with cholesterol for the formation of micelle in the intestinal lumen, thus reducing cholesterol
absorption and lowering serum total and LDL cholesterol levels, and may be protective against atherosclerosis (Marangoni and Poli 2010). In a specific study, it was
revealed that phytosterols reduced LDL by an average of 13% and offered an alternative to statins (Malinowski and Gehret 2010). In contrast, a separate study of mice
demonstrated that phytosterol was not effective in improving metabolic parameters,
including insulin resistance, plasma lipid and glucose levels (Calpe-­Berdiel et al.
2008). However, majority of the studies present data indicating that it may be effective in the treatment of diabetes.

###### **3 Conclusion and Future Perspectives**


C. Hangul et al.


There are various groups of phytochemicals, including flavonoids, polyphenol compounds and carotenoids, which are present in foods as nutraceuticals. Together with
key mechanisms as antioxidant effect, reduction of mitochondrial damage, and
additional mechanisms as vascular regeneration, anti-inflammatory effects; nutraceuticals can be used in diabetes for the (i) prevention of the disease, (ii) prevention
of the complications (iii) treatment of the disease. Being natural compounds, nutraceuticals are recommended for use in diabetes with their potent properties in addition to lower side effects.

##### **Chapter 6**
#### **Nutraceuticals in the Prevention ** **of Chronic Renal Disease**

**Siddharth Goswami, Rohit Dimri, and Pallavi Singh**
###### **1 Introduction**

The WHO estimates that Chronic Renal Disease (CRD) caused 1.3 million deaths
worldwide in 2016 (Remuzzi et al. 2017). The disease impacted 753 million individuals around the world in 2016, out of which there are 336 million men and 417
million women in total.(Bikbov et al. 2018; Tjempakasari et al. 2022) More than 1.2
million patients died from it in the year of 2015, compared to 409,000 in 1990
(Wang et al. 2016) (Naghavi et al. 2015). There are 550,000 deaths from hypertension, 418,000 from diabetes, and 238,000 from glomerulonephritis (Wang et al.
2016). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CRD
was responsible for over 50,000 deaths in America in 2016. A increasing worldwide
health issue, the condition is thought to afflict between 10% and 15% of the world’s
population. Ongoing examination recommends that around 1 of every 10 of the
populace might have CRD, yet it is less usual in youthful grown-ups, being available in 1 out of 50 individuals. In those matured more than 75 years, CRD is available in 1 out of 2 individuals. CRD is a kidney illness where a steady loss of kidney
capability happens over months to years (National Institute of Diabetes and
Digestive and Kidney Diseases 2017). CRD decreases the kidneys’ capacity for
function and is a chronic, progressive disorder. The basic functions of the kidneys
include removing waste from the blood and maintaining the body’s fluid and electrolyte balance. When the kidneys are damaged, they can no longer perform these
functions effectively, causing a buildup of fluid and waste products in the body,
which complicates things including high blood pressure, anaemia, nerve damage,

and a greater hazard of heart disease and stroke. At first, no side effects are seen, yet
later side effects might include leg enlarging, tiredness, heaving, loss of craving,
and confusion (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
2017). Difficulties can connect with hormonal brokenness of the kidneys and hypertension (frequently connected with the enactment of the renin-angiotensin framework), bone sickness, and anaemia (Liao et al. 2012) (KDIGO: Kidney Disease
Improving Global Outcomes, 2009). Furthermore, CRD patients have uniquely
expanded cardiovascular entanglements with expanded dangers of death and hospitalization (Go et al. 2004). Kidney issues can result from a number of diseases or
disorders, including diabetes, hypertension, glomerulonephritis, and polycystic kidney disease (Wang et al. 2016). Disorders are often diagnosed using urine tests to
measure albumin levels and blood tests to calculate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
(National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 2017). For this
reason, a variety of severity-based classification systems are available. In certain
situations, an ultrasound or a kidney biopsy may be performed to diagnose the
underlying cause of the sickness (Ferri et al. 2017).

Pharmaceutical therapy is an imperative characteristic of managing CRD. It is
important to understand that while pharmaceutical treatment can help manage the
symptoms and complications of CRD, it cannot cure the disease. In some cases,
CRD may progress to the point where a kidney transplant or dialysis is necessary.
Therefore, it is important for individuals with CRD to closely monitor their condition and work closely with their healthcare team to ensure proper treatment and
management. Several drug classes, each with a unique mechanism of action and
effect on the disease, are frequently used to treat this condition. Angiotensin-­
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers control
(ARBs) blood pressure and save the kidneys. Angiotensin II, a hormone that causes
blood vessels to constrict and raises blood pressure, was inhibited by these medications (Zhang et al. 2021). Diuretics remove excess fluid from the body and relieve
symptoms such as swelling and shortness of breath (Jia et al. 2021; Al-Sayed et al.
2020). CRD caused anaemia, an illness characterized by a drop in RBCs. Fe alternatives increased iron in the body causing anaemia (Fattinger et al. 2019). CRD can
lead to a decrease in calcium and Vitamin D levels, which can cause bone problems
such as osteoporosis. Calcium and Vitamin D supplements are used to prevent or
treat these problems (Bawazeer et al. 2020). Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents
(ESAs) are the medications that stimulate the synthesis of RBCs and are used to
treat anaemia in people with CRD (Xia et al. 2021; Hu et al. 2020; Li et al. 2019b).
It has been demonstrated that several medications can control CRD by reducing
symptoms and decreasing the disease’s course.

Although these medications can be effective in managing the symptoms of CRD,
they can also cause various side effects as shown in Table 6.1.

Nutraceuticals has been emerged from “nutrition“and “pharmaceutical“, referring the products made from natural sources such as food and herbs that give health
and therapeutic advantages in addition to their nutritional worth. Nutraceuticals
have gained popularity as an alternative to conventional medications in recent years
for a number of causes.

1. Nutraceuticals are often considered safer and have fewer side effects compared

to pharmaceutical drugs, as they are made from natural ingredients and do not
undergo the same level of chemical processing. This makes them more appealing
to consumers who are concerned about the negative impact that pharmaceutical
drugs may have on their health.
2. Nutraceuticals are more accessible and affordable for many people, as they are

widely available and do not require a prescription from a doctor. This allows
individuals to take control of their health and wellness, without relying on expensive medical treatments.

3. Nutraceuticals are becoming increasingly popular as people are becoming more

aware of the importance of a balanced diet and natural remedies for maintaining
good health. The trend towards a more holistic approach to health and wellness
has also driven the demand for nutraceuticals.
4. The growing scientific evidence supporting the health benefits of nutraceuticals

has also contributed to their increased popularity. Nutraceuticals have gained
attention as an alternative to pharmaceuticals due to their perceived safety, accessibility, affordability, popularity, and scientific support. As the demand for natural and holistic health solutions continues to grow, nutraceuticals will likely
show an increasingly important role in the field of health and wellness.

Nutraceuticals have been gaining attention as an alternative to pharmaceuticals in
the therapy of CRD. Nutraceuticals are food-based products that contain nutrients
that are derived from natural sources and promote health, including vitamins,

minerals, and antioxidants. These products are marketed as dietary supplements,
functional foods, and fortified foods and can provide the necessary nutrients to support the health of the kidneys and help manage the symptoms of CRD. Nutraceuticals
have a beneficial effect on CRD, such as, omega-3 fatty acids possess inflammation
restricting characteristics and can slow down the progression of CRD (Navarro-­
Gonzalez et al. 2020). Moreover, vitamin D has been demonstrated to have a protective impact on the kidneys, and it may enhance the results of CRD. (Chowdhury
et al. 2020). In addition, antioxidants including vitamins C and E have a key role in
decreasing oxidative stress, a major factor in CRD. (Chauhan et al. 2019).

The current chapter presents a systematic literature review on the use of nutraceuticals, such as antioxidants and anti-inflammatory substances, in the prevention
of CRD. Inflammation as well as oxidative stress are significant contributors to the
onset and progression of CRD. Furthermore, certain nutraceuticals, including
omega-3 fatty acids and phytochemicals, have demonstrated a protective impact on
the kidneys by lowering oxidative stress and enhancing kidney performance.
Research has shown that several metabolic pathways altering CRD, including those
involved in glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and nitrogen metabolism provide a review for the development of effective treatments for CRD have been discussed. Genome and Proteome changes resulting in alterations in the genetic
expression involved in kidney function and the production of proteins that have a
role in the disease are described. Micronutrients like vitamins, minerals and macronutrients like carbohydrates, proteins and omega-3 fatty acids etc. having efficiency
in treatment are reviewed. Additionally, keto analogues with low-protein, high-fat
diets, reported to improve kidney function in some patients with CRD, maintaining
a healthy diet that is low in salt, fat, and sugar, and high in fibre and micronutrients
have been proposed. Moreover, the correlation between ions uptake and progression
of CRD indicated that levels of sodium and potassium (high and low respectively)
could increase the hazard of developing CRD, while a balanced intake of these ions
can help to reduce the risk describing the relation between diet pattern and mortality
rate have been highlighted in this review analysis. This chapter not only enhances
the understanding of reducing the role of pharmaceuticals while providing the efficiency of nutraceuticals over pharmaceuticals.
###### **2 Nutraceuticals Alternative to Pharmaceuticals Involved ** **to Treat CRD with Their Mechanism of Action**

Nutraceuticals that contain specific nutrients such as iron, vitamin B12, folic acid,
potassium, magnesium, vitamin C, cocoa, omega-3 fatty acids, and green tea have
shown potential benefits in treating Chronic Renal Disease (CRD). These nutrients
have been found to exert positive results on various physiological processes such as
blood pressure regulation, glucose metabolism, endothelial function, inflammation,
oxidative stress, and cardiovascular risk.

157


1. **Folic acid, iron, and vitamin B12:** In individuals with chronic renal disease,

folic acid, iron, and vitamin B12 can enhance erythropoiesis and treat anaemia.
Several studies have shown how supplementing with folic acid, iron, and vitamin
B12 can improve haemoglobin levels in these individuals and lessen their
requirement for erythropoiesis-stimulating medications (Zhu et al. 2018; Jafari
et al. 2019).
2. **Potassium and Magnesium:** Potassium and magnesium are essential minerals

that are involved in several physiological processes in the body, including blood
pressure regulation and glucose metabolism. Patients with chronic renal disease
often have reduced levels of potassium and magnesium, which can lead to hypertension and insulin resistance. Nutraceuticals containing potassium and magnesium can help to correct these deficiencies and improve blood pressure control
and glycemic control (Raj et al. 2018).
3. **Vitamin C:** Patients with chronic renal disease frequently experience oxidative

stress and inflammation, which can be mitigated by the potent antioxidant vitamin C. Many studies have demonstrated that vitamin C administration in these
individuals can enhance endothelial function and lessen inflammation and oxidative stress (Saran et al. 2015; Bahrami et al. 2020).
4. **Cocoa:** Flavonoids, which are polyphenolic chemicals with antioxidant and

anti-inflammatory effects, are present in cocoa. Several studies have demonstrated that consuming cocoa can increase insulin sensitivity, decrease inflammation and oxidative stress, and enhance endothelial function in people with
chronic renal impairment (Taubert et al. 2007; Farhat et al. 2020).
5. **Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are among those

having anti-inflammatory properties. Several studies have demonstrated that
individuals with chronic renal illness who take omega-3 fatty acid supplements
experience decreased oxidative stress, decreased inflammation, and improved
endothelial function (Zhang et al. 2018; Mollazadeh et al. 2019a).
6. **Green Tea:** Catechins, polyphenolic substances found in green tea, have anti-­

inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Green tea drinking has been linked to
improved endothelial function, decreased oxidative stress and inflammation, and
lowered cardiovascular risk in those with chronic renal illness, according to
many studies (Yamabe et al. 2013; Li et al. 2021) (Table 6.2).
###### **3 Metabolic Pathways Altered in Chronic Renal Disease**

CRD is connected to a wide range of metabolic changes that might hasten the illness’s development and raise the risk of consequences including cardiovascular disease, anaemia, and bone disease.

Metabolic pathways that is commonly altered in CRD is the urea cycle. The urea
cycle is responsible for converting toxic ammonia, a by-product of protein metabolism, into less toxic urea, which can be safely excreted by the kidneys. Because the
kidneys are less able to carry out this excretory function in chronic kidney disease,

harmful uremic solutes build up in the blood. The urea cycle is thus disturbed, and
the concentrations of urea cycle intermediates including citrulline, arginine, and
ornithine are changed. In chronic kidney illness, important urea cycle enzymes
including arginase and carbamoyl phosphate synthetize also exhibit decreased
activity (Krishnan et al. 2017). This disruption of the urea cycle can lead to a number of complications, including hyperammonemia, which can cause neurological
symptoms, as well as alterations in protein metabolism and impaired nitrogen
balance.

Insulin resistance is among the metabolic changes that are most noticeable in
CRD. This happens as a result of diminished insulin sensitivity and decreased glucose metabolism, which results in hyperglycaemia (Schrauben et al. 2019). Several
mechanisms are thought to contribute to insulin resistance in CRD, including oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis. These processes can lead to dysfunction of
the insulin signalling pathway and impaired glucose uptake by cells, ultimately
resulting in insulin resistance. Insulin resistance can also develop as a result of additional variables that are frequently linked to CRD, such as obesity and hypertension.
Insulin resistance can result from both hypertension and obesity, both of which can
impede insulin signalling and promote chronic inflammation (Hall et al. 2015).
Also, it might raise the risk of cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of death
among CRD patients (Chueakula et al. 2018).

Dyslipidemia is a common metabolic abnormality observed in individuals with
chronic kidney disease (CRD). It is characterized by low levels of HDL and elevated
levels of LDL and triglycerides in the bloodstream, leading to abnormal blood lipid
levels. Lipid metabolism is a vital function of the kidneys, and in CRD, this function
may be impaired, leading to the development of dyslipidemia. Dyslipidemia is a
major risk factor for atherosclerosis, which is a complication of CRD and increases
the risk of cardiovascular disease. Moreover, dyslipidemia can further exacerbate
renal damage by promoting the accumulation of lipids in the kidneys, which can
cause inflammation, fibrosis, and worsen renal function (Khandelwal et al. 2016;
Hager et al. 2017). Dyslipidemia is a significant metabolic alteration associated
with CRD that can have detrimental effects on both renal and cardiovascular health.

Many amino acids, including methionine, cysteine, and tryptophan, exhibit
decreased metabolism, which is another alteration of amino acid metabolism in
CRD (Kalantar-Zadeh and Fouque 2017). Increased inflammation and oxidative
stress may result from this, which might worsen kidney damage. The synthesis of
erythropoietin, a hormone that promotes the creation of red blood cells, can be
impacted by impaired amino acid metabolism, which can also contribute to the
emergence of anaemia, a typical consequence of CRD (Griffin and Bradshaw 2017).

Inflammation and oxidative stress are common occurrences in chronic kidney
disease (CRD) and can lead to changes in several metabolic pathways. High levels
of oxidative stress can cause damage to DNA, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial
dysfunction, and exacerbate kidney damage (Wu et al. 2021; Valentijn et al. 2021).
Furthermore, two inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis
factor-alpha (TNF-α), are often elevated in CRD and contribute to systemic inflammation and metabolic abnormalities. These changes can adversely affect the

metabolism of amino acids, lipids, and glucose, leading to anemia, dyslipidemia,
and insulin resistance (Lee et al. 2015; Khanaghaei et al. 2022). Oxidative stress and
inflammation are one of key factors in the development and progression of CRD,
leading to alterations in several metabolic pathways and complications such as anemia, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance.

Alterations in several metabolic pathways, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, mineral metabolism, amino acid metabolism, glucose, and lipid metabolism,
are linked to CRD. The risk of consequences including cardiovascular disease,
anaemia, and bone disease might rise as a result of these changes, which can also
speed up the advancement of kidney impairment. To create CRD therapies that work
and stop the illness from becoming worse, it is essential to comprehend these metabolic alterations (Fig. 6.1).

Pathways altered are primarily due to the reduced function of the kidneys, which
are responsible for filtering waste products and maintaining the balance of various
substances in the blood.

**Protein Metabolism** A critical function of the kidneys is the elimination of waste
products from protein metabolisms, such as urea and creatinine. The kidney’s
capacity to filter out these waste products is impaired in chronic renal disease,
resulting in their accumulation in the blood and the development of uraemia.
Additionally, protein intake may need to be restricted in chronic renal disease to
prevent the build-up of waste products (Garibotto et al. 2010).

**Carbohydrate Metabolism** Insulin resistance, which raises blood sugar levels and
raises the chance of developing diabetes, is a potential side effect of chronic renal
illness. It is not entirely known how renal illness produces insulin resistance,
although it is believed to be connected to the buildup of harmful compounds in the
blood. A reduction in the body’s capacity to utilise glucose for energy as a result of

**Fig. 6.1** The metabolic pathways that are altered in CRD


-----

162


S. Goswami et al.


insulin resistance might increase the synthesis and buildup of ketone bodies in the
body (De et al. 2013).

**Lipid Metabolism** The kidneys eliminate triglycerides and other fats from the
blood. Chronic renal failure impairs the kidney’s ability to eliminate these lipids,
causing them to accumulate in the blood and increase the risk of cardiovascular
disease. The kidneys’ inability to adequately remove extra cholesterol from the
body may be to blame for the decline in HDL cholesterol levels (Baek et al. 2022).

**Mineral and Electrolyte Metabolism** The kidneys help regulate the balance of
minerals and electrolytes in the body, such as potassium, sodium, and calcium. In
chronic renal disease, the kidneys’ ability to regulate these substances is impaired,
leading to imbalances in their levels. High levels of potassium, for example, can
result from impaired kidney function and can lead to muscle weakness or heart
rhythm disturbances, while low levels of calcium can lead to bone disease (Kistler
et al. 2021).

**Vitamin Metabolism** Some vitamins, such as vitamin D and vitamin B12, are
processed by the kidneys. In chronic renal disease, the kidney’s ability to produce
active vitamin D is reduced, leading to decreased calcium absorption and bone disease. The kidneys’ ability to absorb and metabolize vitamin B12 is also impaired,
leading to anaemia and neurological symptoms.

**Glucose Metabolism** It is the method used to break down glucose in order to create energy. Patients with CRD frequently have impaired glucose metabolism, which
can result in side effects include insulin resistance and poor glucose tolerance.
Several research have examined how dietary therapies affect individuals with
CRD‘s glucose metabolism. A low-carb diet improved glucose metabolism and
decreased insulin resistance in CRD patients, according to a randomised controlled
experiment (Tay et al. 2015). Another investigation revealed that omega-3 fatty acid
supplementation can enhance glucose metabolism by lowering oxidative stress and
inflammation (Mollazadeh et al. 2019b).

Glucose metabolism is altered in CRD due to insulin resistance and impaired
glucose utilization. The decreased insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion can lead
to hyperglycaemia in CRD patients. Moreover, glucose is also synthesized from
non-carbohydrate sources like amino acids through the process of gluconeogenesis,
which is increased in CRD. This process may lead to increased serum glucose levels, thereby worsening insulin resistance. Additionally, glycosylation of proteins
and lipids due to high blood glucose levels can also contribute to the development
of diabetic complications in CRD patients. A study (Cigarran-Guldris et al. 2019)
found that CRD patients had increased gluconeogenesis and decreased glucose utilization, leading to impaired glucose metabolism.

**Nitrogen Metabolism** It is another crucial metabolic pathway that is responsible
for the removal of nitrogenous waste products from the body. In patients with CRD,
nitrogen metabolism is often impaired, leading to the accumulation of toxic waste
products like urea and creatinine. Low-protein diets and keto acid supplementation


-----

163


have been shown to improve nitrogen metabolism and reduce the accumulation of
toxic waste products in patients with CRD (Klahr et al. 1982; Shao et al. 2019).

Nitrogen metabolism is also altered in CRD due to reduced glomerular filtration
rate (GFR) and impaired renal function. Urea, the main nitrogenous waste product,
is usually excreted by the kidneys. However, in CRD, the accumulation of urea and
other nitrogenous compounds can lead to various complications like uremic syndrome and chronic inflammation. Moreover, CRD patients have decreased protein
intake due to dietary restrictions and proteinuria, which can lead to decreased amino
acid availability for protein synthesis and increased protein catabolism. This process can further worsen nitrogen metabolism and lead to muscle wasting and sarcopenia. According to one study, CRD patients have impaired nitrogen metabolism as
a result of reduced protein synthesis and increased protein catabolism (Filiopoulos
et al. 2016).
###### **4 Genome and Proteome Change in Chronic Renal Diseases**

A variety of inherited and environmental factors impact chronic renal disorders.
Alterations in the affected person’s DNA and proteome define these disorders at the
molecular level. Affected people’s proteomes and genomes can alter due to chronic
renal disorders. The proteome is the whole collection of proteins that are expressed
by an organism or cell at any one moment. In contrast, the genome refers to the
entire set of genetic material, including all of a person’s genes. ***4.1 Chronic Renal Diseases and Genome Changes***

A person’s entire genetic makeup, including DNA and genes, is referred to as their
genome. In chronic renal disorders such chronic kidney disease, mutations or
changes in the expression of genes that control kidney function can have an impact
on the genome (CKD) (Table 6.3).

Genetic anomalies or changes in the expression of genes involved in metabolism,
immune response, and kidney function can be responsible for chronic renal diseases. For example, the formation and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD)
can be attributed to genes that produce RAAS (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system) proteins. The RAAS system’s dysregulation can lead to hypertension and ultimately renal failure, as it is essential for maintaining fluid balance and managing
blood pressure (Gupta et al. 2020). In addition, the altered expression of several
genes linked to fibrosis and inflammation, including matrix metalloproteinases
(MMPs), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), has
been linked to CRD. Variations in the angiotensinogen (AGT) and renin (REN)
genes, which regulate inflammation and blood pressure, have also been associated
with an increased risk of developing CRD (Chen et al. 2018; Arablou et al. 2021).

Moreover, genetic polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor gene (VDR) and apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) have been linked to an increased risk of renal disease,
particularly in African Americans (Kumar et al. 2019). Genetic changes and variations in genes involved in metabolism, immune response, and kidney function can
be the underlying cause of CRD. Gene expressions such as RAAS proteins, MMPs,
TGF-β, IL-6, AGT, REN, VDR, and APOL1 can significantly increase the risk of
developing CRD.

Environment-related factors including diet, toxin exposure, and stress can have
an influence on these changes in gene expression patterns. For instance, it has been
demonstrated that eating a lot of salt causes the RAAS system’s genes to be
expressed more often, which can lead to hypertension and kidney damage. Besides

injuring the kidneys and causing sickness, toxins like heavy metals and pesticides
can also alter gene expression patterns (Rust and Ekmekcioglu 2017).

Mutations in the genes that code for the proteins involved in the metabolism of
poisons and medications are another example of genetic abnormalities that cause
chronic kidney disorders. Kidney disease can result from these mutations because
they can alter how the body removes and processes toxic chemicals. For instance,
mutations in the CYP1A1 gene, which encodes a drug-metabolizing enzyme, have
been associated with an increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD)
in individuals exposed to environmental contaminants including cigarette smoke
and industrial pollutants (Siddarth et al. 2022).
###### ***4.2 Chronic Renal Diseases and the Proteome***

All the proteins that are expressed by a multi-cellular organism, tissues, and organs
collectively make up their proteome. By altering the amounts of protein production,
modifications, and destruction, among other things, CRD may modify the proteome.

At the proteome level, chronic renal disorders (CRD) may affect the expression
of proteins involved in fibrosis, inflammation, and renal function. CKD is associated
with increased generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-­6 (IL-6). These cytokines contribute to the development of chronic inflammation
in the kidney, leading to fibrosis and tissue damage (Romanova et al. 2020). Chronic
renal disorders can also affect the production of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, which are critical for maintaining the structural integrity of the kidney. For
example, in CKD, reduced production of ECM proteins such as collagen and laminin may lead to the collapse of renal structure and subsequent fibrosis. Conversely,
there is an increase in the production of fibrosis-associated proteins such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and fibronectin, which promote the deposition
of ECM proteins and the onset of fibrosis (Gerrits et al. 2022; Zhong et al. 2017).

According to studies, CRD can cause proteins involved in renal function, inflammation, and fibrosis to express themselves at different levels. Furthermore, post-­
translational changes of proteins such glycosylation, phosphorylation, and
acetylation may be abnormally high in patients with CRD.

Overall, the modifications to the genome and proteome that take place in chronic
renal disorders reflect the intricate interplay between hereditary and environmental
variables that contribute to the onset and progression of these ailments. In order to
create more successful therapies for individuals with chronic renal illnesses, it
might be helpful to understand these changes in order to find new therapeutic targets. New diagnostic and treatment strategies for CRD may be developed with the
use of this understanding. To identify those who are at a high risk of getting CRD,
for example, genetic testing can be utilized, enabling early intervention and prevention. Moreover, targeted treatments that control.

###### **5 Role of Micronutrients in Combating CRD**


S. Goswami et al.


Micronutrients are critical nutrients that the body needs in minute quantities to
function normally. They consist of vitamins, minerals, and trace elements that are
essential for supporting the body’s physiological and metabolic activities.
Micronutrient deficiencies are common in CRD patients, according to several studies, and they may accelerate the disease’s development.

One such micronutrient that has been well studied in connection to CRD is vita
min D. In order to preserve bone health, vitamin D is crucial, and a lack of it has
been related to the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism, a frequent consequence of CRD (Jean et al. 2017). Inflammation, immunological response, and
blood pressure regulation are all critical elements in the onset and progression of
CRD, and vitamin D is thought to modulate these processes. According to studies,
vitamin D supplements can help CRD patients with proteinuria (excess protein in
the urine) and renal function (Kim and Kim 2014).

Omega-3 fatty acids are another micronutrient that has been investigated in relation to CRD. Fish and other plant-based sources include omega-3 fatty acids, which
are polyunsaturated fatty acids. They are well-recognized for having anti-­
inflammatory and anti-thrombotic qualities, and they could also help lower blood
pressure and improve lipid profiles. According to studies, people with CRD who
take omega-3 fatty acid supplements experience less proteinuria and a slower loss
of renal function (Saglimbene et al. 2020; Hirahashi 2017).

Another category of micronutrients that has been investigated in regard to CRD
is antioxidants. Antioxidants are chemicals that shield cells from oxidative stress,
which is thought to contribute to the onset of CRD. Antioxidants including vitamin
C (Hongsawong et al. 2021), vitamin E (Daenen et al. 2019), and beta-carotene may
lessen oxidative stress and enhance renal function in people with CRD, according to
studies. Antioxidant vitamin C helps lessen oxidative stress on the kidneys.
According to studies, vitamin C supplements may benefit CRD patients with proteinuria (excess protein in the urine) and renal function (Hongsawong et al. 2021).

Selenium, magnesium, and zinc have all been investigated in connection to CRD
(Fukasawa et al. 2023; Filler et al. 2021). Although magnesium is crucial for maintaining healthy bones and controlling blood pressure, zinc has a role in immunological health and wound healing. Antioxidant selenium has been found to lessen
oxidative stress and inflammation. Research has revealed that these individuals with
CRD frequently have mineral deficiencies, and supplementation may enhance kidney function and lessen proteinuria.

While medicinal therapies continue to be the predominant CRD management
method, it is important to recognize the impact that diet and micronutrients have in
halting or delaying the disease’s progression. It has been demonstrated that micronutrients including vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and minerals can
enhance kidney function, lessen proteinuria, and control oxidative stress and inflammation. Optimizing nutrient intake may be a beneficial adjunct therapy for people
with CRD, according to existing data, while further study is required to understand
the function of micronutrients in CRD management fully (Table 6.4).

|Micronutrient|Role in combating CRD|Natural sources|Reference|
|---|---|---|---|
|Vitamin D|Maintains bones strong and the body’s calcium and phosphorus levels stable, all of which are necessary for healthy kidney function. An increased risk of cardiovascular disease and the development of CKD is associated with low vitamin D levels|Fatty fish (including salmon, tuna, and mackerel), mushrooms, egg yolks, cheese, and meals supplemented with vitamins and minerals (such as milk and cereal)|Jean et al. (2017) and Kim and Kim (2014)|
|Vitamin C|Has antioxidant properties, protects against inflammation, and aids in the absorption of iron, which can be important for those with CRD who may experience frequent infections or anemia|Citrus fruits (such as oranges and grapefruits), strawberries, kiwi, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and bell peppers|Hongsawong et al. (2021)|
|Vitamin B6|Helps regulate homocysteine levels in the blood, which can contribute to kidney damage if levels are too high|Chickpeas, salmon, chicken|Chen et al. (2016)|
|Vitamin E|Has antioxidant properties and can protect against inflammation and oxidative stress|Nuts, seeds, spinach|Daenen et al. (2019)|
|Zinc|Helps support immune function and wound healing, zinc deficiency include ESA hyporesponsive anaemia, nutritional challenges, or cardiovascular problems|Oysters, beef, pork, chicken, beans, and nuts|Fukasawa et al. (2023)|
|Iron|Required for red blood cell formation and oxygen transport. Iron deficiency anemia is common in CKD patients and can worsen kidney function. Supplementation may improve anemia and slow the progression of CKD|Red meat, chicken, fish, beans, tofu, and fortified cereals|Batchelor et al. (2020)|
|Omega-3 fatty acids|Reduced proteinuria in patients with CKD, and also help to lower blood pressure, which is another common complication of CKD|Fatty fish (such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel), flaxseed, chia seeds, walnuts, and soybeans|Saglimbene et al. (2020) and Hirahashi (2017)|

###### **6 Role of Macronutrients in Controlling the Progression ** **of Chronic Renal Disease**

Macronutrients, which comprise carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, have been found
to have a substantial impact on how the body responds to CRD. Carbohydrates are
necessary for the body’s energy demands, but they can also contribute to the onset
of insulin resistance in CRD patients. Insulin resistance, which occurs when the
body’s cells cease reacting to the actions of insulin, is the cause of high blood sugar

S. Goswami et al.


levels. The loss of renal function can be accelerated and kidney disease can get
worse when blood sugar levels are high. As a result, patients with CRD must closely
watch their carbohydrate consumption. Whole grains, legumes, and non-starchy
vegetables, which have a low glycaemic index, can help manage blood sugar levels
and avoid insulin resistance.

Protein is required for tissue maintenance and repair, however, in CRD, high
protein consumption might hasten the loss of renal function (Isaka 2021). Waste
products are produced as a result of protein metabolism and are typically eliminated
by the kidneys. As a result of waste products building up in the circulation, damaged
kidneys and other organs suffer severe damage. Those with CRD are thus advised to
have a diet that contains very little or no protein. High-quality protein sources
including eggs, fish, poultry, and lean meats should be used since they supply the
body’s tissues with crucial amino acids. Beans, lentils, and tofu are plant-based
sources of protein that should only be used in moderation to preserve healthy renal
function (Tallman et al. 2022; Jakše et al. 2019). A balanced diet must include fats
since they are vital to the body’s cellular and hormonal processes. Nevertheless,
consuming too much fat can lead to the emergence of metabolic conditions such as
obesity, dyslipidaemia, and insulin resistance. Several disorders can further impede
renal function, and patients with CRD are more likely to develop them. As a result,
a diet high in unsaturated fats, such as those found in fatty fish, nuts, seeds, and
plant oils, and low in saturated fats is suggested.

Macronutrients are essential for controlling CRD. A balanced diet low in carbs,
moderate in protein, and moderate in fat should be consumed by those with
CRD. This dietary strategy can control blood sugar levels, manage metabolic diseases, and delay the onset of CRD (Table 6.5).
###### **7 Role of Proteins and Keto Analogues in Control of CRD**

**Proteins**

Low Protein Diet (LPD) reduces nitrogen side effects and decreases kidney activity
by lowering intraglomerular pressure, which may protect the kidneys, especially in
individuals with decreased nephron capital and renal capacity (Fouque et al. 2007;
Bellizzi et al. 2013). LPD prompts great metabolic impacts that can protect kidney
capability and uremic side effects as recorded underneath and portrayed in Fig. 6.2
(Kovesdy et al. 2016). Conversely, High Protein Diet (HPD) put an adverse consequence on CRD as displayed in Fig. 6.3.

LPD is effective in the treatment of metabolic acidosis in CRD.The quantity
of sulfur-containing amino acids created during protein digestion, as well as the
amount of predialysis serum bicarbonate fixed, were lower in individuals who
consumed more protein (Scialla et al. 2013; Goraya et al. 2012). In CRD, ongoing metabolic acidosis results in protein digestion inhibition, muscle catabolism, wasting, and bothers decrease in kidney ability and uremic symptoms
(Goraya et al. 2015). Indeed, LPD decreased metabolic acidosis in individuals

|Protein|Restricting protein intake slows the progression of CKD by reducing the workload on the kidneys and decreasing proteinuria|Chicken, fish, eggs, tofu, lentils, beans, quinoa|Ko et al. (2017)|
|Carbohydrates|Consuming complex carbs rather than simple sweets can aid in blood glucose regulation and insulin sensitivity. Low-­ carbohydrate diets enhance glycemic control in individuals with diabetic nephropathy, a frequent consequence of CKD|Whole grains, fruits, vegetables|Mirabelli et al. (2020) and Zainordin et al. (2021)|
|Fat|Limiting saturated and trans fats can help prevent cardiovascular disease, which is a common complication of chronic renal disease. Consuming healthy fats, such as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, may also improve lipid profiles and reduce inflammation|Nuts, seeds, avocado, olive oil, fatty fish|Mafra et al. (2021) and Sabatino et al. (2017)|
|Fiber|High-fiber diets improve lipid profiles and reduce inflammation, which are risk factors for CKD progression.|Whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds.|Ranganathan et al. (2022)|

with advanced CRD. A study investigating the effects of an Improved Very Low
Protein Diet showed that mean serum bicarbonate levels in the control (LPD)
group remained below 19 mmol/L, while they rose to normal levels in the VLPD
group (Garneata et al. 2016). LPD offers further developed control of ongoing
kidney illness mineral and bone problems (CRD-Minerals and Bone Disorder
(MBD)). The administration of hyperphosphatemia in CRD requires cautious
dietary control, as dietary protein, particularly from creature sources, is a critical donor of phosphorus (St-Jules et al. 2016; Streja et al. 2013; Cupisti et al.
2013). According to research, an LPD, particularly one that contains plantbased protein, is effective in lowering blood phosphorus levels and causing
decreases in serum levels of parathyroid hormone and fibroblast growth factor-23 (Di Iorio et al. 2012; Scialla et al. 2012). Albeit the advantages of an LPD
in CRD-MBD, like easing back the movement of vascular calcification and
working on cardiovascular well-being are recognized (Fouque et al. 2014), it is
essential to look at that as a low-protein diet exclusively used to control hyperphosphatemia may not be the best methodology and may bring about adverse
results (Jiang et al. 2016; Shah et al. 2015a, b).

**Keto Analogues**
Nutritional supplementation with essential amino acids (EAAs) and keto-analogues
has been recommended for persons on very low protein diets (VLPD) for optimal
health (Fouque et al. 2016). It is important to obtain EAAs from food sources as the
body cannot produce them on its own. On the other hand, keto-analogues, derived
from the transamination of EAAs excluding lysine and threonine, can be converted
into individual EAAs without producing nitrogen waste (Shah et al. 2015a, b).


-----

171


Protein-energy status can be maintained without the increase in nitrogen by-­products
with EAA and keto-analogue supplementation, phosphorus and acidic load can be
reduced because purified EAA and keto-analogues contain no phosphorus, and protein degradation and synthesis can be improved. However, it has been argued that a
long-term protein intake of less than 25% of recommended levels (as the minimum
protein requirement to avoid negative nitrogen balance is less than 0.6 g/kg/day)
may compromise overall health and well-being due to the risk of hypercatabolic
conditions such as illness. This has sparked a rising tendency in the field of renal
nutrition that contends that EAAs or keto-analogues should be added to even a protein intake of 0.6 g/kg/day (Kovesdy et al. 2013). It is recommended that at least
half of the daily protein intake on both low protein diets and VLPD come from high
biological value proteins. Although research on the use of keto-analogues in regulating CRD is still ongoing, the use of keto-analogues in conjunction with a VLPD
has been demonstrated in certain trials to enhance metabolic control in instances of

hyperphosphatemia and anaemia, two common consequences of CRD.
###### **8 Diet Profile/Pattern of Patients with Acute Renal Disease ** **and Chronic Renal Disease**

**Acute Renal Disease**
A fast and temporary reduction in kidney function is a defining feature of acute
renal disease, also known as acute kidney injury (AKI). If left untreated, AKI is a
dangerous and often fatal illness that raises the risk of developing chronic renal
disease and causes long-term kidney damage (CKD). Recent research has focused
on determining the causes, risk factors, and treatment options for AKI. The three
most prevalent causes of AKI, according to a 2019 systematic review published in
the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, are ischemia injury, nephrotoxic injury, and prerenal injury (Chawla et al. 2019). It demonstrates the need of
identifying and treating these underlying causes early on in order to avert AKI and
improve patient outcomes. According to a research published in the American
Journal of Kidney Diseases in 2020, age, prior kidney disease, and particular
medicines, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are all important risk factors for AKI. This study also discovered that these risk variables
should be continuously monitored and maintained in order to reduce the occurrence of AKI. Early identification and rapid treatment are critical for lowering the
severity and duration of AKI and improving patient outcomes, according to a
systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Clinical Journal of the
American Society of Nephrology in 2018. (Furth et al. 2018). According to the
authors, early identification and diagnosis of AKI can be aided by regular monitoring of renal function and the use of biomarkers such blood creatinine and urine
output. According to a 2017 research in the Journal of Renal Nutrition, supportive
care—which includes fluid management, electrolyte replacement, and nutrition

intervention—helps patients with AKI feel better and experience less time in the
hospital (Bhowmik et al. 2017).

The nutrition profile for individuals with acute renal illness is crucial for maintaining kidney function and avoiding additional injury. Recent study has highlighted the significance of customised dietary treatments in the treatment of acute
renal damage (AKI). Fluid restriction was reported to be an effective therapy for
minimising fluid buildup in patients with AKI in a comprehensive review and
meta-analysis published in the Journal of Renal Care in 2018. (Hsu et al. 2018). It
demonstrates that tailored fluid restriction based on patient-specific parameters
including hydration status and urine output may be the most effective. A 2017
study published in the Journal of Renal Nutrition discovered that a low-potassium
diet was beneficial in lowering potassium levels in the blood of AKI patients
(Bhowmik et al. 2017). The study suggests closely monitoring potassium levels
and tailored potassium limitation based on patient requirements. According to a
research published in the American Journal of Kidney Diseases in 2020, phosphorus restriction was helpful in lowering blood phosphorus levels in AKI patients
(van et al. 2020). The authors speculate that phosphorus restriction could benefit
certain AKI patients, but they caution that more studies are required to completely
comprehend how phosphorus restriction affects this population. Some medications and dietary supplements, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) and vitamin D, may have a negative effect on kidney function and
should be avoided or restricted in AKI patients, according to a comprehensive
study that was published in the Journal of Nephrology in 2021 (Beng et al. 2021).
The study suggests that AKI patients’ medication and supplement use be closely
monitored and controlled.

Patients with acute renal illness must eat a balanced and healthy diet to help
them restore kidney function and general health. Individuals with acute renal illness may need to reduce their protein consumption to prevent additional kidney
damage. However, it is still important for them to consume enough high-quality
protein to support their overall health and recovery. Good protein sources for
patients with the acute renal disease include lean meats, hens, fish, eggs, and dairy
products. Fluid intake is critical for patients with acute renal disease, as their kidneys may not be able to effectively remove excess fluid from the body. It is important for these patients to monitor their fluid intake and limit their consumption of
fluids if their doctor has advised them to do so. High sodium intake can increase
fluid retention and put extra strain on the kidneys. AKI patients should reduce
their sodium consumption and avoid high-sodium items including processed
foods, canned soups, and fast food. Potassium is an essential element that aids in
fluid equilibrium in the body. However, high potassium levels can be harmful to
patients with acute renal disease and may lead to further damage to the kidneys.
AKI sufferers should limit their potassium intake and avoid high-potassium foods
such as bananas, oranges, and potatoes. Phosphorus is another important mineral
that helps build and maintain strong bones. However, high phosphorus levels can
also be harmful to AKI sufferers. Patients with AKI should reduce their

phosphorus consumption and stay away from processed meals, meat, and dairy
products, which are all high in phosphorus.

Overall patients with acute renal disease should follow a diet that is low in protein, sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. They should also consume enough high-­
quality protein and monitor their fluid intake. Patients with the acute renal disease
need to work closely with a registered dietitian or a doctor to develop an individualized diet plan that meets their specific needs and supports their overall health and

recovery.

**Chronic Renal Disease**

Patients with CRD require special dietary management to support their kidney function and overall health. Patients with CRD often need to limit their protein intake to
reduce the workload on their kidneys (Kovesdy et al. 2013). However, it is important for these patients to still consume enough high-quality protein to support their
overall health and recovery. Good protein sources for patients with CRD include
lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy products (Levey et al. 2003). Fluid management is important for patients with CRD, as their kidneys may not be able to
effectively remove excess fluid from the body (Giamouzis et al. 2017). These
patients may need to limit their fluid intake, particularly if their kidney function is
severely compromised (Giamouzis et al. 2017). High sodium intake can increase
fluid retention and put extra strain on the kidneys (Giamouzis et al. 2017). Patients
with CRD should limit their sodium intake and avoid high-sodium foods such as
processed foods, canned soups, and fast food (Giamouzis et al. 2017). Potassium is
an important mineral that helps regulate fluid balance in the body (Levey et al.
2003). However, high potassium levels can be harmful to patients with CRD and
may lead to further damage to the kidneys (Levey et al. 2003). Patients with CRD
should limit their potassium intake and avoid high-potassium foods such as bananas,
oranges, and potatoes (Levey et al. 2003). Phosphorus is another important mineral
that helps build and maintain strong bones (Kovesdy et al. 2013). However, high
phosphorus levels can also be harmful to patients with CRD (Kovesdy et al. 2013).
Individuals who have CRD may need to watch their phosphorus intake and stay
away from items high in phosphorus such dairy, meat, and processed foods (Kovesdy
et al. 2013). When kidney function declines, patients with CRD may need to manage their consumption of additional vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin D and
iron (Levey et al. 2003). They may need to take supplements or consume fortified
foods to meet their nutritional needs (Levey et al. 2003).

Overall, patients with chronic renal disease should follow a diet that is low in
protein, sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. They should also monitor their fluid
intake and vitamin and mineral intake, as necessary. Patients with CRD need to
work closely with a registered dietitian or a doctor to develop an individualized diet
plan that meets their specific needs and supports their overall health and recovery.

**Acute vs Chronic Renal Disease in Diet Profile**
Acute renal disease is a sudden and severe impairment of renal function that
may result from an injury, illness, or exposure to certain medications or toxins.


-----

174


S. Goswami et al.


In this condition, the kidneys are still able to compensate and maintain fluid and
electrolyte balance, but they may require temporary changes in the intake of
certain nutrients. Individuals with acute renal disease may need to restrict their
intake of fluids, sodium, and potassium. They may also need to increase their
intake of protein, depending on the extent of the renal damage and their overall
health status. On the other hand, chronic renal disease is a long-term, progressive reduction in renal function that over time causes the loss of kidney function. Individuals with chronic renal disease often require ongoing management
of their dietary intake, as the disease progresses and the kidneys become less
able to perform their functions. They may need to limit their intake of protein,
phosphorus, potassium, and fluid, and may also need to take supplements of
vitamins and minerals that their kidneys can no longer adequately retain.
Furthermore, a low-sodium diet may also be necessary for patients who have
chronic renal illness in order to assist control high blood pressure, which is a
typical side effect of the condition.
###### **9 Types of Diet Pattern for CRD Patients**

The utilization of plant-based products has become progressively normal in the
administration of CRD. Such eating regimens comprise basically plant-based
food sources like organic products, vegetables, nuts, seeds, oils, entire grains,
vegetables, and beans, and might possibly incorporate restricted measures of creature items like meat, fish, fish, eggs, or dairy. Various instances of plant-based
counts calories incorporate veganism, the Mediterranean eating regimen, the
Dietary Ways to deal with Stop Hypertension (Run) diet, and good dieting designs
(Apetrii et al. 2021).

The DASH diet, also known as dietary approaches to stop hypertension, is an
all-encompassing eating plan that emphasizes the consumption of vegetables, whole
grains, fruits, low-fat dairy products, nuts, and moderate amounts of chicken, fish,
and nuts, while limiting the intake of red and processed meats, salt, and sweetened
beverages (Apetrii et al. 2021). On the other hand, the traditional Mediterranean diet
places a strong emphasis on fresh foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grain cereals, bread, beans, potatoes, nuts, and seeds, and recommends the use of extra virgin
olive oil. It also suggests moderate consumption of dairy products, fish, and chicken,
occasional use of wine during festivities, and rare consumption of red meat. Overall,
both diets prioritize the consumption of healthy, nutrient-dense foods while limiting
the intake of less nutritious options.

A healthy diet often includes a high intake of natural foods like fruits, vegetables,
seafood, whole grains, cereals, and fibre while consuming moderate amounts of red
meat, salt, and processed sweets. These dietary examples have been connected to
decreased cardiovascular occasions and death rates in both sound grown-ups and
those at high hazard for cardiovascular sickness (Apetrii et al. 2021) (Table 6.6).

###### **10 Correlation Between Ions Uptake and Progression ** **of Chronic Renal Disease**

The progression of CRD is associated with alterations in the renal handling of
ions, including sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorus. As the disease
advances, the kidney’s ability to regulate these ions becomes diminished, leading
to the development of several complications and co-morbidities. In people with
CRD, sodium is a vital element that needs to be carefully regulated since high
levels can cause fluid retention and higher blood pressure, both of which may
speed up the disease’s course (Cannata-Andia et al. 2018). Potassium is another
ion that must be managed in individuals with CRD, as high levels can be harmful
to the heart (Cannata-Andia et al. 2018). Calcium and phosphorus are also critical
ions in the context of CRD. Calcium is crucial for maintaining bone health, while
phosphorus is involved in various cellular processes (Cannata-Andia et al. 2018).
In CRD, the kidney’s ability to balance these ions becomes impaired, resulting in
low calcium levels and increased phosphorus levels, which can result in the development of bone disease and other complications (Cannata-Andia et al. 2018).
Alterations in the renal processing of ions are associated with the evolution of
CRD. In order to create a specific strategy for regulating their ion levels and preserving their best health, people with CRD must collaborate closely with a healthcare provider. Since these changes can cause a wide range of problems and
co-morbidities.

According to research, excessive sodium and low potassium levels are associated
with the development and development of CRD. Sodium is a positively charged ion
that is essential for maintaining fluid balance and blood pressure. Elevated degrees
of sodium in the blood can be unsafe, as they can prompt liquid maintenance and
expanded circulatory strain, the two of which are realized harmful factors for the
turn of events and movement of CRD (Nordmann et al. 2019). Then again, potassium is an adversely charged particle that is engaged with different physiological
cycles, including the guideline of circulatory strain and liquid equilibrium. Low
degrees of potassium in the blood have been related to an expanded hazard of cardiovascular sickness, including CRD (Nordmann et al. 2019). According to research,
people with CRD frequently have abnormal sodium and potassium levels, with
excessive sodium and low potassium levels being frequent results (Nordmann et al.
2019). These alterations in ion levels can exacerbate the progression of CRD and
contribute to the development of various complications and co-morbidities
(Nordmann et al. 2019). Risk factors for the onset and progression of CRD include
high salt and low potassium levels. As the disease progresses, alterations in ion
levels can contribute to the development of various complications and co-­morbidities,
making it imperative for individuals with CRD to work closely with a healthcare
professional to manage their ion levels and maintain optimal health (Nordmann
et al. 2019).

###### **11 Correlation Between Diet Pattern and Mortality Rate ** **in Chronic Renal Disease**


177


Diet is an indispensable component impacting the wellbeing results of people with
CRD. Several research have been conducted to investigate the association between
dietary patterns and the mortality rate in CRD. The findings of these research suggest that the quality of food intake might have a major influence on the health and
survival of CRD patients. The experimental studies show that consuming a lot of
animal protein (especially red and processed meats) increases the risk of mortality
in CRD patients (Kovesdy et al. 2016). On the other side, a decreased death rate in
CRD patients has been associated with a larger diet of plant-based protein, particularly legumes, nuts, and seeds (Levey et al. 2003). This suggests that the source of
protein in the diet is a crucial factor in determining the health outcomes of CRD
patients.

Fluid management is also an important aspect of diet in CRD patients, as their
kidneys may not be able to effectively remove excess fluid from the body (Giamouzis
et al. 2017). High sodium intake can increase fluid retention and put extra strain on
the kidneys (Giamouzis et al. 2017). Patients with CRD should consume less salt
and stay away from high-sodium items including processed meals, canned soups,
and fast food to lower their risk of passing away (Levey et al. 2003). The balance of
minerals in the diet can also affect the mortality rate of CRD patients. High potassium levels can be harmful to these patients and may lead to further damage to the
kidneys (Levey et al. 2003). Patients with CRD should limit their potassium intake
and avoid high-potassium foods, such as bananas, oranges, and potatoes, to reduce
the risk of death (Levey et al. 2003). High phosphorus levels can also be harmful to
CRD patients and may increase the risk of death (Kovesdy et al. 2016). To maintain
their health, people with CRD may need to reduce their phosphorus consumption
and stay away from high-phosphorus foods including dairy, meat, and processed
foods. (Kovesdy et al. 2016).

The health and life of CRD patients depend on consuming a balanced and nourishing diet. A diet that is high in plant-based protein should be consumed by
patients with CRD and low in animal protein, salt, potassium, and phosphorus.
They should also monitor their fluid and mineral intake, as necessary, and work
closely with a registered dietitian or doctor to develop an individualized diet plan
that meets their specific needs and supports their overall health and recovery
(Levey et al. 2003).
###### **12 Conclusion**

Nutraceuticals involving in the CRD therapy can complement traditional medical
treatments, offering several benefits in managing the symptoms and slowing down
the progression of the disease. Certain dietary supplements, such omega-3 fatty

inflammation. Others, like as calcium and vitamin D, are crucial for keeping bones
strong and avoiding difficulties in CRD patients. However, it is important to note
that while nutraceuticals can provide some therapeutic benefits, they should not be
seen as a substitute for medical treatment. To choose the best course of action for

treating their disease, patients with CRD should always consult carefully with their
healthcare physician. This may involve a combination of conventional medical
treatment, lifestyle changes, and the use of nutraceuticals, tailored to their individual needs. Overall, the use of nutraceuticals can provide a complementary approach
to the management of CRD, helping patients to achieve better health results.

A well-balanced diet that emphasizes fruits and vegetables and limits animal
protein can bring several benefits to individuals with CRD. It may alleviate the
severity of symptoms in advanced stages and even decrease mortality. Reducing
protein consumption may also lead to a reduction in sodium intake and improved
blood pressure control. However, it can be challenging to determine the long-term
health effects solely due to dietary changes, as other lifestyle factors like physical
activity, avoiding tobacco, and moderate alcohol consumption may also play a role.
Adherence to these dietary patterns may also be challenging for some patients, and
a personalized approach should be taken to determine the best course of action.
Comprehensive education, dietary advice, and routine monitoring by a renal dietitian are necessary to improve adherence. By effectively implementing a low- or
very-low-protein diet, patients could save their kidneys in the long run.

The current chapter provided a systematic literature review on the nutraceuticals
used in CRD prevention, such as antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds,
which play a role in reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which are
important factors in the development and progression of CRD. Furthermore, certain
nutraceuticals, including omega-3 fatty acids and phytochemicals, have demonstrated a protective impact on the kidneys by lowering oxidative stress and enhancing kidney performance. Research had shown that several metabolic pathways
altering CRD, including those involved in glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism,
and nitrogen metabolism provide a review for the development of effective treatments for CRD have been discussed. Genome and Proteome changes resulting in
alterations in the genetic expression involved in kidney function and the production
of proteins that have an impact on the disease. Micronutrients like vitamins, minerals and macronutrients like carbohydrates, proteins and omega-3 fatty acids etc.
having efficiency in treatment are reviewed. Additionally, keto analogues with low-­
protein, high-fat diets, reported to improve kidney function in some patients with
CRD, maintaining a healthy diet that is low in salt, fat, and sugar, and high in fiber
and micronutrients have been proposed. Moreover, the correlation between ions
uptake and progression of CRD indicated that sodium and potassium level i.e. high
and low could increase the risk of developing CRD, while a balanced intake of these
ions can help to reduce the risk describing the relation between diet pattern and
mortality rate have been highlighted. Hence, this chapter not only enhances the
understanding of reducing the role of pharmaceuticals while providing the efficiency of nutraceuticals for therapy in upcoming research and development.

###### **1 Introduction**

Chronic pancreatitis is a complex and debilitating disease characterized by inflammation and progressive destruction of the pancreas, which is a vital organ located
behind the stomach’s upper left side of the abdomen (Pham and Forsmark 2018).
This organ plays a crucial role in the digestion of food and the regulation of blood
sugar levels. The pancreas produces enzymes necessary for the digestion of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats in the small intestine. Additionally, it releases hormones such as insulin and glaucoma aetiology, which regulate blood sugar levels
(Karpińska and Czauderna 2022). In chronic pancreatitis, the pancreas becomes
chronically inflamed, leading to progressive damage, and scarring leading to persistent excruciating abdominal pain which can be constant or intermittent with the
possibility of radiating to the back, impaired digestion, and a host of other complications (Goulden 2013). This inflammation can be triggered by a variety of factors,
including heavy alcohol consumption, gallstones, genetic predisposition, autoimmune disorders, and certain medications (Weiss et al. 2019). However, in some

cases, the cause of chronic pancreatitis remains unknown, which adds to the complexity of the disease. Significantly, it’s been observed that pancreatitis pain often
worsens after meals or during periods of excessive alcohol consumption. As the
disease progresses, patients may experience weight loss, malnutrition, diarrhoea,
and steatorrhea (fatty stools). These symptoms arise from impaired digestion and
absorption of nutrients due to pancreatic insufficiency. Furthermore, chronic pancreatitis can lead to the development of complications such as pseudocysts, pancreatic duct strictures, diabetes mellitus, and even pancreatic cancer, further
exacerbating the challenges faced by patients (Tandon et al. 2002). The effective
management of chronic pancreatitis necessitates a collaborative approach involving
gastroenterology consultation, endocrinological medications, balanced nutritional
diet, pain management, and surgical interventions. The main objectives of treatment
include relieving pain, enhancing digestion and nutritional well-being, and preventing or handling potential complications. Pain management often involves a combination of medications, including analgesics, pancreatic enzyme supplements, and
sometimes opioids. However, due to the opioid crisis and concerns regarding addiction and tolerance, alternative approaches like nerve blocks, neuromodulation techniques, and psychological interventions are often being explored (Kosten and
George 2002).

Moreover, nutritional support is one of the essential approaches in chronic pancreatitis, as malabsorption and malnutrition are common consequences of the disease (Cañamares-Orbís et al. 2022). Patients may require a specialised diet that is
low in fat, high in protein, and supplemented with pancreatic enzymes (Rasmussen
et al. 2013). In severe cases where oral intake is inadequate, enteral, or parenteral
nutrition may be necessary. Controlling blood sugar levels is another critical management aspect, particularly in patients with concomitant diabetes mellitus (DM).
Thus, close monitoring, dietary modifications, and appropriate medication regimens
are essential to achieve optimal glycemic control. Although progress has been made
in comprehending chronic pancreatitis, considerable challenges remain. Firstly,
diagnosing the disease is intricate due to symptoms resembling other gastrointestinal disorders, and imaging studies may not always yield conclusive outcomes (Gilja
et al. 2007). Consequently, there are often delays in diagnosis and the implementation of suitable treatment. Furthermore, managing chronic pancreatitis demands a
personalized strategy that considers the patient’s symptoms, complications, and
nutritional requirements. The diverse presentation and progression of the disease
further hinder the establishment of standardized treatment guidelines. Moreover,
there is a paucity of effective therapies that can halt or reverse the progression of
chronic pancreatitis. Current treatment strategies primarily focus on symptom control and complication management (Banks et al. 2010). Researchers are actively
investigating potential targets for therapy, such as anti-inflammatory agents, antioxidants, and agents that promote pancreatic regeneration (Fig. 7.1).

###### **2 Nutritional Management of Chronic Pancreatitis**

Nutritional management plays a crucial role in the overall treatment plan for patients
with chronic pancreatitis. The primary goal of nutritional intervention is to ensure
adequate nutrient intake, manage symptoms, and prevent complications associated
with malnutrition. The pancreas produces digestive enzymes that help break down
proteins, carbohydrates, and fats but in chronic pancreatitis, the production of these
enzymes is reduced leading to malabsorption and malnutrition (Lakananurak and
Gramlich 2020). Therefore, pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) is
commonly prescribed by clinicians, which involves taking pancreatic enzyme supplements with meals and snacks to facilitate the digestion and absorption of nutrients. The dosage of pancreatic enzymes is determined based on the severity of

pancreatic insufficiency, the size of the meals, and individual patient response
(Brennan and Saif 2019). Dietary modifications with a low-fat diet are often recommended to minimize the inflammatory stimulation in the pancreas (Pan et al. 2017).
However, it is important to note that a low-fat diet does not mean eliminating all fats
from the diet as healthy fats, (Avocados, Nuts, Olive oil, etc.), are still necessary for
overall health. The focus is on reducing saturated fats and avoiding foods that are
fried, greasy, or high in trans fats. In addition to fat restriction, a diet high in protein
is usually recommended as it is essential for tissue repair and recovery, helping to
maintain muscle mass (Carbone and Pasiakos 2019). Subsequently, lean sources of
proteins (skinless poultry, fish, tofu, legumes, etc.) are preferred over fatty cuts of
meat. For some patients, a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet may be beneficial in
managing blood sugar levels as well, especially if they have concurrent DM.

Also, frequent small meals and snacks are often recommended to ease the pancreatic load and improve digestion. Regular meals spaced throughout the day, along
with nutritious snacks, help to maintain a steady supply of nutrients and prevent
excessive hunger or overeating. In cases where malnutrition or inadequate oral
intake is a concern, enteral (delivering nutrients directly into the gastrointestinal
tract through a feeding tube) or parenteral (administered intravenously) nutrition
may be required. These methods are typically used when the pancreas is severely
damaged, and the patient is unable to meet their nutritional needs through oral
intake alone. Enteral nutrition is preferred over parenteral nutrition whenever possible, as it helps to maintain gut integrity and function (Seres et al. 2013).

Furthermore, macronutrient (vitamins and minerals) management are essential
as malabsorption may lead to deficiencies in certain vitamins and minerals, such as
fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), calcium, magnesium, and zinc. Supplementation
may be necessary to address these deficiencies and ensure optimal nutrient status.
Regular monitoring of nutritional parameters, including blood levels of vitamins
and minerals, is essential to guide supplementation and identify deficiencies
(Montoro-Huguet et al. 2021). Pancreatitis can lead to digestive problems, including diarrhoea. Soluble fibres, such as pectin and psyllium, can help absorb water
and bulk up the stool, making it softer and easier to pass. Fibre can help regulate
bowel movements by adding bulk and promoting regularity. This can be particularly
helpful if pancreatitis has caused constipation or irregular bowel movements.
Dietary fibres act as prebiotics, providing nourishment to beneficial gut bacteria.
This helps maintain a healthy gut microbiota, which is crucial for overall digestive
health and immune function (McRorie Jr. 2015). Certain types of soluble fibres,
such as beta-glucan and oat bran, have been shown to reduce LDL cholesterol levels
(Sima et al. 2018). This is important because people with pancreatitis may have an
increased risk of developing heart disease. High-fibre foods have a lower glycemic
index, meaning they cause a slower rise in blood sugar levels (Eleazu 2016). This
can be beneficial for individuals with pancreatitis who may also have diabetes or
impaired glucose tolerance. Fibre-rich foods tend to be more filling and can help
control appetite, which is particularly useful for managing weight and preventing
overeating, as obesity is a risk factor for pancreatitis (Ribichini et al. 2019). A well-­
balanced diet that is low in fat, high in protein, and supplemented with pancreatic

enzymes is essential to alleviate symptoms, prevent malnutrition, and improve overall well-being (Cañamares-Orbís et al. 2022).
###### **3 Digestive Enzymes: Restoring Pancreatic Function ** **and Nutrient Absorption**

Digestive enzymes play a crucial role in the process of breaking down food into
smaller molecules that can be absorbed and utilized by the body, and they are
released by the pancreas (Ianiro et al. 2016). However, in chronic pancreatitis or
pancreatic insufficiency, the production and secretion of digestive enzymes are
impaired, leading to difficulties in nutrient absorption and digestion (Hackert
et al. 2014).

Digestive enzyme supplements have emerged as a valuable intervention for
restoring pancreatic function and optimising nutrient absorption in such patients.
Most recently, PERT which involves the administration of exogenous digestive
enzymes to compensate for pancreatic insufficiency has been recognised as a potential therapeutic approach (Olivier et al. 2015). Pancreatic enzyme supplements typically contain a combination of lipases, proteases, and amylases (as listed in
Table 7.1), which are encapsulated in enteric-coated tablets/capsules to be delivered
in the acidic environment of the stomach (Ketwaroo and Graham 2019). The enteric
coating allows the enzymes to reach the small intestine, where they can exert their
digestive effects.

**Table 7.1** This table highlights an array of digestive enzymes and their specific functions and
sources in the body. They are essential in digesting various nutrients, aiding their absorption and
promoting overall digestive well-being

|S.No|Name of the associated enzymes|Functional properties|Food sources|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Amylase|Converts carbohydrates into sugars|Saliva, pancreas, small intestines|

The administration of pancreatic enzyme supplements with meals helps to restore
the proper digestion and absorption of nutrients. These supplements should be taken
at the beginning or during a meal, depending on the individual’s digestive needs and
the specific formulation of the enzyme supplement (Trang et al. 2014). The dosage
of pancreatic enzymes is determined based on the severity of pancreatic insufficiency and the individual’s response to treatment. One of the primary benefits of
pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is the improvement in nutrient absorption.
By providing exogenous enzymes, PERT aids in the breakdown of fats, proteins,
and carbohydrates into smaller molecules that can be readily absorbed by the small
intestine (Boivin et al. 1990; Lowe 2002). This allows individuals with pancreatic
insufficiency to regain the ability to absorb essential nutrients and prevent malnutrition. Moreover, proper nutrient absorption can contribute to weight gain and the
restoration of healthy body composition in individuals who have experienced significant weight loss due to chronic pancreatitis. In addition to improving nutrient
absorption, digestive enzyme supplements can help alleviate the symptoms associated with pancreatic insufficiency.
###### **4 Anti-inflammatory Nutrients: Easing ** **Pancreatic Inflammation**

Certain nutrients possess anti-inflammatory properties that can help ease pancreatic
inflammation in conditions like chronic pancreatitis. Including these nutrients in the
diet can provide support for the pancreas and aid in managing inflammation-related
symptoms. Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fatty fish like salmon and mackerel (Krupa
and Parmar n.d.), as well as flaxseeds (Kajla et al. 2015) and chia seeds (Grancieri
et al. 2019), have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects. Incorporating these
foods into the diet can help reduce inflammation in the pancreas. Turmeric, a spice
commonly used in curry dishes, contains an active compound called curcumin that
exhibits potent anti-inflammatory properties (Table 7.2). Adding turmeric to meals
or consuming it as a supplement may help alleviate pancreatic inflammation
(Sharifi-Rad et al. 2020). Ginger, another spice known for its anti-inflammatory
effects, can be beneficial in reducing inflammation in the pancreas (Ballester et al.
2022). It can be consumed in various forms, including fresh ginger root, powdered
ginger, or ginger tea. Green leafy vegetables, such as spinach, kale, and broccoli, are
rich in antioxidants and other anti-inflammatory compounds. Including these vegetables in the diet can provide essential nutrients while helping to combat pancreatic
inflammation (Pollock 2016). Berries, such as blueberries and strawberries, are
packed with antioxidants that possess anti-inflammatory properties. These fruits can
be incorporated into meals and smoothies or consumed as snacks (Kalt et al. 2020).
However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian before making significant dietary changes, as individual needs and considerations may vary.

###### ***4.1 Omega-3 Fatty Acids***


D. Jindal et al.


Omega-3 fatty acids have shown promise in easing pancreatic inflammation, particularly in conditions such as chronic pancreatitis. These essential fatty acids have
anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce the severity of inflammation and
its associated symptoms. Omega-3 fatty acids, including eicosapentaenoic acid
(EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are primarily found in fatty fish such as
salmon, mackerel, sardines, and trout (Lei et al. 2015). They can also be obtained
from plant-based sources like flaxseeds, chia seeds, and walnuts (Gebauer et al.
2006). These fatty acids play a crucial role in modulating the body’s inflammatory
response. Studies have suggested that omega-3 fatty acids can help alleviate pancreatic inflammation by suppressing the production of pro-inflammatory molecules
called cytokines (Mori and Beilin 2004; Mayer et al. 2003). These cytokines play a
significant role in promoting inflammation in the pancreas (Mayer et al. 2000). By
reducing their production, omega-3 fatty acids help dampen the inflammatory
response and promote a more balanced immune system. In addition to their anti-­
inflammatory effects, omega-3 fatty acids have also been shown to improve blood
flow, reduce oxidative stress, and support overall pancreatic health (Wall et al.
2010). By enhancing blood flow to the pancreas, these fatty acids promote the delivery of oxygen and nutrients necessary for tissue repair and healing (Barchitta et al.
2019). To incorporate omega-3 fatty acids into the diet, it is recommended to consume fatty fish at least twice a week. If fish is not an option, plant-based sources like
flaxseeds, chia seeds, and walnuts can be included. Omega-3 supplements derived
from fish oil or algae are also available for those who have difficulty meeting their
needs through diet alone.

It is important to note that omega-3 fatty acids should be consumed as part of a
balanced diet and in consultation with a healthcare professional. While omega-3
fatty acids have shown anti-inflammatory effects, they should not be considered a
standalone treatment for pancreatic inflammation (Weylandt et al. 2008) A comprehensive approach, including medication management and lifestyle modifications, is
necessary for managing pancreatic conditions.
###### ***4.2 Curcumin***

Curcumin, the active compound found in the spice turmeric, has gained attention for
its potential to ease pancreatic inflammation. Turmeric has a long history of use in
traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties, and curcumin is considered its primary bioactive component (Hewlings and Kalman 2017). Studies have
shown that curcumin possesses strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which can help mitigate pancreatic inflammation (Jurenka 2009). It exerts its
effects by modulating various signalling pathways involved in the inflammatory
response, thereby reducing the production of pro-inflammatory molecules. In the
context of pancreatic inflammation, curcumin has demonstrated promising results.
It can inhibit the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), a transcription factor
that plays a pivotal role in promoting inflammation. By inhibiting NF-κB, curcumin
helps downregulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enzymes,
thereby reducing pancreatic inflammation (Wang et al. 2019). Additionally, curcumin has been found to possess antioxidant properties, which can counteract oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is known to contribute to pancreatic damage and
inflammation. By neutralizing harmful free radicals, curcumin helps protect pancreatic cells from oxidative damage and supports their overall health (Jakubczyk
et al. 2020).

Turmeric can be added to various dishes, including curries, soups, and stir-fries.
However, it is important to note that the bioavailability of curcumin is relatively low.
Its absorption and utilization by the body can be enhanced by consuming it with
black pepper or pairing it with fats, such as coconut oil (Han 2011). In addition to
dietary sources, curcumin supplements are available. These supplements typically
provide higher concentrations of curcumin than what can be obtained through food
alone. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before
starting any new supplements, as they may interact with certain medications or have
contraindications for specific health conditions. While curcumin shows promise in
easing pancreatic inflammation, it is important to recognize that it should not be
considered a standalone treatment for pancreatic conditions. A comprehensive
approach, including medical management and lifestyle modifications, is essential
for the management of pancreatic inflammation.

D. Jindal et al.


Ginger, a commonly used spice with a long history of medicinal use, has been studied for its potential to ease pancreatic inflammation. It contains various bioactive
compounds, including gingerols and shogaols, which contribute to its anti-­
inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Research suggests that ginger exhibits
anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enzymes (Shahrajabian et al. 2019). By modulating inflammatory pathways, ginger can help reduce pancreatic inflammation and its associated symptoms.
Moreover, ginger has been found to possess antioxidant activity, which helps protect pancreatic cells from oxidative stress. Oxidative stress plays a role in the development and progression of pancreatic inflammation. The antioxidants present in
ginger can scavenge free radicals and minimize cellular damage, supporting the
overall health of the pancreas. Studies specifically investigating the effects of ginger
on pancreatic inflammation are limited, but preliminary research and anecdotal evidence suggest its potential benefits. Ginger has been traditionally used to alleviate
digestive discomfort, including symptoms associated with pancreatic disorders
(Akimoto et al. 2015).

To incorporate ginger into the diet, fresh ginger root can be peeled and grated,
then added to various dishes, teas, or smoothies. Dried ginger powder can also be
used as a convenient option. Ginger supplements are available, but it is important to
consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplements, as they
may interact with certain medications or have contraindications for specific health
conditions. While ginger shows promise in easing pancreatic inflammation, it
should be considered as part of a comprehensive treatment plan, including medical
management and lifestyle modifications. It is not a substitute for professional medical advice or treatment.
###### **5 Antioxidant Nutrients: Protecting Pancreatic Cells ** **from Oxidative Stress**

Antioxidant nutrients play a crucial role in protecting pancreatic cells from oxidative stress, a condition characterized by an imbalance between the production of
harmful free radicals and the body’s ability to neutralize them. Oxidative stress can
contribute to pancreatic inflammation and damage, making antioxidant support
important for pancreatic health (Robles et al. 2013). Vitamin C, also known as
ascorbic acid, is a potent antioxidant that helps neutralize free radicals and reduce
oxidative stress (Chambial et al. 2013). It supports the regeneration of other antioxidants, such as vitamin E, and plays a vital role in maintaining the health of pancreatic tissues (Traber and Stevens 2011). Good sources of vitamin C include citrus
fruits, berries, kiwi, and leafy green vegetables (Doseděl et al. 2021). Vitamin E is
another important antioxidant that protects pancreatic cells from oxidative damage.
It helps maintain the integrity of cell membranes and prevents the oxidation of

lipids. Nuts, seeds, vegetable oils, and leafy green vegetables are rich sources of
vitamin E (Liao et al. 2022). Selenium is a trace mineral that acts as a cofactor for
antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase. These enzymes help neutralize free radicals and reduce oxidative stress. Selenium can be found in foods like
Brazil nuts, fish, shellfish, and whole grains (Zoidis et al. 2018). Beta-carotene is a
precursor to vitamin A and possesses potent antioxidant properties. It helps protect
pancreatic cells from oxidative damage and supports overall cellular health. Foods
rich in beta-carotene include carrots, sweet potatoes, spinach, and other brightly
coloured fruits and vegetables (Lavy et al. 2004). Flavonoids, a group of plant compounds with antioxidant activity, have been shown to have protective effects on
pancreatic cells. Foods rich in flavonoids include berries, citrus fruits, apples,
onions, and tea (Ullah et al. 2020) Incorporating a variety of antioxidant-rich foods
into the diet can provide the necessary nutrients to support pancreatic health. To
obtain a diverse array of antioxidants, consuming a wide range of fruits, vegetables,
nuts, seeds, whole grains, and healthy fats is recommended (Table 7.3).

While dietary sources are the preferred way to obtain antioxidants, supplements
can also be considered in consultation with a healthcare professional. However, it is
important to note that high-dose antioxidant supplementation may not always be
beneficial and can even have adverse effects in certain cases. Therefore, it is recommended to seek professional guidance before starting any antioxidant
supplements.

###### ***5.1 Vitamin C: Enhancing Pancreatic Defence Mechanisms***

Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, plays a significant role in enhancing pancreatic defence mechanisms against oxidative stress and inflammation. As a potent
antioxidant, vitamin C helps neutralize harmful free radicals and protects pancreatic
cells from oxidative damage. Here are some ways in which vitamin C enhances
pancreatic defence mechanisms:

1. ***Free Radical Scavenging*** : Vitamin C acts as a powerful antioxidant, donating

electrons to neutralize free radicals and prevent them from causing cellular damage. By scavenging free radicals, vitamin C helps protect pancreatic cells from
oxidative stress, which can contribute to inflammation and tissue damage
(Niki 1991).
2. ***Regeneration of Other Antioxidants*** : Vitamin C plays a key role in regenerating

other antioxidants, such as vitamin E. After vitamin E neutralizes free radicals,
it becomes oxidized. However, vitamin C can regenerate vitamin E, allowing it
to continue its antioxidant function. This synergy between vitamins C and E
helps maintain a robust antioxidant defence system in the pancreas (Kaźmierczak-­
Barańska et al. 2020).
3. ***Collagen Synthesis*** : Vitamin C is essential for collagen synthesis, a crucial com
ponent of connective tissues, including those found in the pancreas. Collagen
provides structural support to blood vessels, ensuring optimal blood flow and
nutrient delivery to pancreatic cells. By promoting collagen synthesis, vitamin C
supports pancreatic tissue integrity and overall health (Gref et al. 2020).
4. ***Immune Function:*** The pancreas contains immune cells that play a role in the

defence against pathogens and inflammation. Vitamin C supports immune function by enhancing the activity of various immune cells, such as lymphocytes and
phagocytes. This immune-boosting effect can aid in protecting the pancreas
from infections and inflammatory processes (Carr and Maggini 2017).
5. ***Anti-inflammatory Effects:*** In addition to its antioxidant properties, vitamin C

has anti-inflammatory effects. It can help modulate inflammatory pathways,
reduce the production of pro-inflammatory molecules, and promote a more balanced immune response. Vitamin C contributes to the overall defence mechanisms against pancreatic damage by mitigating inflammation in the pancreas
(Gęgotek and Skrzydlewska 2022).

To ensure adequate vitamin C intake, it is recommended to consume a varied diet
rich in fruits and vegetables, which are excellent sources of this vitamin. Citrus
fruits (such as oranges and grapefruits), berries, kiwi, peppers, and leafy green vegetables are particularly high in vitamin C. If needed, vitamin C supplements can be
considered, but it is important to follow the recommended dosage and consult with
a healthcare professional, as excessive intake can have adverse effects.

2. ***Lipid Peroxidation Prevention:*** The pancreas contains lipids (fats) that are vul
nerable to oxidation, leading to a process called lipid peroxidation. Vitamin E
plays a critical role in inhibiting lipid peroxidation by scavenging free radicals
that initiate this process. By preventing lipid peroxidation, vitamin E helps maintain the integrity of pancreatic cell membranes and protects against tissue damage (Niki 2021).
3. ***Enzyme Support:*** Vitamin E supports the activity of various enzymes involved

in critical pancreatic functions. It helps preserve the integrity and activity of
enzymes that are essential for proper digestion, nutrient absorption, and metabolism. By ensuring optimal enzyme function, vitamin E supports overall pancreatic health and efficient digestive processes (Coskun et al. 2020).
4. ***Anti-inflammatory Effects:*** Chronic inflammation can contribute to pancreatic

damage and dysfunction. Vitamin E has been shown to possess anti-­inflammatory
properties, helping to reduce inflammation in the pancreas. By modulating
inflammatory pathways and inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory molecules, vitamin E can help mitigate the harmful effects of inflammation on pancreatic tissues (Singh et al. 2005).
5. ***Immune System Support:*** The immune system plays a vital role in pancreatic

health, as it helps protect against infections and inflammation. Vitamin E supports immune function by enhancing the activity of immune cells, promoting a
healthy immune response, and aiding in the defence against pathogens that can
affect pancreatic tissues (Lewis et al. 2019).

Good dietary sources of vitamin E include nuts (such as almonds and sunflower
seeds), seeds, vegetable oils (such as wheat germ oil and sunflower oil), spinach,
and fortified cereals. Incorporating these foods into the diet can help ensure an adequate intake of vitamin E. Vitamin E supplements are also available, but it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplements

ing in redox reactions. It helps regenerate other antioxidants, such as vitamin C
and vitamin E, which have a protective role against oxidative stress. By replenishing these antioxidants, selenium enhances the antioxidant defence system in
the pancreas, reducing the burden of oxidative stress on pancreatic tissues
(Tinggi 2008).
3. ***Anti-Inflammatory Effects:*** Chronic inflammation is closely linked to pancre
atic damage and dysfunction. Selenium has been shown to possess anti-­
inflammatory properties, helping to reduce inflammation in the pancreas. By
modulating the activity of inflammatory mediators and signalling pathways,
selenium can help mitigate inflammation and protect pancreatic tissues from
inflammatory damage (Mahmoodpoor et al. 2022).
4. ***Immune System Support:*** The immune system plays a vital role in pancreatic

health, defending against infections and inflammation. Selenium supports
immune function by influencing the activity of immune cells, including lymphocytes and macrophages. By optimizing immune responses, selenium aids in protecting pancreatic tissues from immune-mediated damage and contributes to
overall pancreatic health (Huang et al. 2012).
5. ***DNA Repair and Cell Growth Regulation:*** Selenium is involved in DNA repair

mechanisms and the regulation of cell growth and proliferation. These functions
are crucial for maintaining the integrity of pancreatic cells and preventing the
development of abnormal cell growth. By ensuring proper DNA repair and cell
growth regulation, selenium helps safeguard the pancreas against cellular damage and dysfunction (Bera et al. 2013).

Selenium can be obtained through dietary sources such as Brazil nuts, seafood (particularly tuna, sardines, and shrimp), meat, poultry, eggs, and whole grains. However,
the selenium content of foods can vary depending on the soil in which they are

dietitian or gastroenterologist, is crucial to assess nutrient status, determine appropriate supplementation needs, and monitor the effectiveness of supplementation.

Supplementation should be accompanied by a well-balanced diet that focuses on
meeting nutrient needs as much as possible through food sources. The goal is to
optimize nutrient intake through dietary modifications and targeted supplementation to address deficiencies and support overall health and well-being in individuals
with chronic pancreatitis.
###### ***7.1 Vitamin D: Strengthening Pancreatic Immunity***

Vitamin D, often referred to as the “sunshine vitamin,” plays a crucial role in supporting immune function and has been found to have a positive impact on pancreatic
health and immunity. Here’s how vitamin D strengthens pancreatic immunity:

1. ***Immune Cell Regulation:*** Vitamin D plays a vital role in modulating the immune

system. It helps regulate the function of immune cells, including T cells, B cells,
and macrophages, which are involved in immune responses and defence against
pathogens. By promoting the proper functioning of immune cells, vitamin D
supports a balanced immune response in the pancreas (Lewis et al. 2019; Prietl
et al. 2013).
2. ***Anti-inflammatory Effects:*** Chronic inflammation is a characteristic feature of

pancreatic diseases, including chronic pancreatitis. Vitamin D exhibits anti-­
inflammatory properties, helping to reduce inflammation in the pancreas. By
modulating inflammatory responses, vitamin D supports a healthier immune
environment in the pancreas and may help alleviate inflammation-related symptoms (Lewis et al. 2019).
3. ***Antimicrobial Activity:*** Vitamin D has antimicrobial properties and helps protect

against infections. In the pancreas, vitamin D enhances the production of antimicrobial peptides, which are small proteins that help fight against various pathogens, including bacteria and viruses. By bolstering the immune defences in the
pancreas, vitamin D contributes to a stronger immune response against potential
infections (Hewison 2011).
4. ***Insulin Sensitivity:*** Vitamin D has been associated with improved insulin sensi
tivity and glucose regulation. Proper insulin sensitivity is essential for maintain

ing blood sugar levels and preventing metabolic imbalances that can contribute
to pancreatic dysfunction. By supporting insulin sensitivity, vitamin D helps
maintain pancreatic health and function (Sung et al. 2012).
5. ***Pancreatic Cancer Prevention:*** Vitamin D has been linked to a reduced risk of

pancreatic cancer, a malignancy that often has a poor prognosis. Studies have
shown that vitamin D may inhibit the growth of pancreatic cancer cells, induce
cell differentiation, and suppress tumour cell proliferation. While more research
is needed to fully understand the mechanisms involved, vitamin D’s potential
protective effects against pancreatic cancer highlight its importance in maintaining pancreatic health (Bulathsinghala et al. 2010).

It is worth noting that vitamin D deficiency is common worldwide, especially in
regions with limited sunlight exposure or individuals with reduced sun exposure.
Dietary sources of vitamin D include fatty fish (such as salmon and mackerel), fortified dairy products, eggs, and certain mushrooms. However, it can be challenging to
obtain adequate amounts of vitamin D through diet alone. In such cases, vitamin D
supplementation may be recommended, particularly for individuals with chronic
pancreatitis or other pancreatic conditions.

It is important to consult with a healthcare professional to assess vitamin D levels
and determine the appropriate dosage for supplementation. They can help determine
the optimal blood levels of vitamin D and provide guidance on safe and effective
supplementation.
###### ***7.2 B Vitamins: Nourishing Pancreatic Cells***

B vitamins play a vital role in nourishing pancreatic cells and supporting their
proper functioning. These water-soluble vitamins are involved in numerous metabolic processes and cellular functions that are essential for pancreatic health. Here’s
how B vitamins nourish pancreatic cells:

4. ***Pyridoxine (B6):*** Pyridoxine is involved in a wide range of enzymatic reactions,

including protein metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, and immune function.
It supports the proper functioning of pancreatic cells by participating in various
metabolic pathways and assisting in synthesising important molecules
(Srinivasan et al. 2019).
5. ***Cobalamin (B12):*** Cobalamin is necessary for the synthesis of DNA and red

blood cell production. It plays a crucial role in nerve function and helps maintain
the integrity of nerve cells, including those in the pancreas. Cobalamin supports
the overall health and function of pancreatic cells (Yuan et al. 2021).
6. ***Folate (B9):*** Folate is essential for DNA synthesis and repair. It is involved in

cell division and growth, supporting the regeneration and maintenance of pancreatic tissues. Adequate folate levels are important for the proper functioning of
pancreatic cells and the overall health of the pancreas (Said et al. 2010).

Vitamin B is found in a variety of foods, including whole grains, legumes, leafy
green vegetables, meat, fish, and dairy products. A balanced diet that includes these
food sources can help ensure an adequate intake of B vitamins. However, certain
factors, such as malabsorption or specific dietary restrictions, may increase the risk
of B vitamin deficiencies in individuals with chronic pancreatitis. In such cases,
supplementation may be recommended under the guidance of a healthcare
professional.
###### ***7.3 Zinc: Supporting Pancreatic Enzyme Production***

Zinc is an essential mineral that plays a vital role in supporting pancreatic enzyme
production. Pancreatic enzymes are crucial for the digestion and absorption of nutrients. Here’s how zinc supports pancreatic enzyme production:

1. ***Enzyme Synthesis:*** Zinc is involved in the synthesis and secretion of pancreatic

enzymes, including amylase, lipase, and proteases. These enzymes are responsible for breaking down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, respectively, into
smaller molecules that can be absorbed by the body. Adequate zinc levels are
necessary for the proper production and secretion of these enzymes by pancreatic cells (Wang et al. 2020).
2. ***Enzyme Activation:*** Zinc also plays a role in activating certain pancreatic

enzymes. For example, zinc is required for the activation of pancreatic lipase,
which is necessary for the breakdown and absorption of dietary fats. Without
sufficient zinc, the activation of these enzymes may be impaired, leading to
reduced digestive capacity (Brugger and Windisch 2016).
3. ***DNA and Protein Synthesis:*** Zinc is involved in DNA synthesis and protein

synthesis, both of which are essential for the growth and maintenance of pancreatic tissues. Zinc supports the synthesis of proteins, including the enzymes pro

proper functioning of pancreatic cells (Kelleher et al. 2011).
4. ***Immune Function:*** Zinc is crucial for maintaining a healthy immune system,

and a well-functioning immune system is important for pancreatic health. The
pancreas is susceptible to inflammation and damage, and a balanced immune
response is necessary to protect and support its optimal functioning. Zinc supports immune cell function and helps regulate immune responses in the pancreas, contributing to its overall health (Wang et al. 2020).
5. ***Antioxidant Défense:*** The pancreas is susceptible to oxidative stress, which can

lead to tissue damage and inflammation. Zinc acts as an antioxidant and helps
protect pancreatic cells from oxidative damage. It participates in the antioxidant
defence system, supporting the neutralization of free radicals and reducing oxidative stress in the pancreas (Prasad and Bao 2019).

Dietary sources of zinc include seafood, meat, poultry, dairy products, legumes,
nuts, and seeds. However, individuals with chronic pancreatitis may have impaired
absorption and increased zinc losses, which can lead to zinc deficiency. In such
cases, zinc supplementation may be recommended under the guidance of a healthcare professional to ensure adequate zinc levels and support pancreatic enzyme
production.
###### **8 Targeted Nutrient Synergy: Enhancing Treatment Efficacy**

Targeted nutrient synergy refers to the strategic combination of specific nutrients to
enhance treatment efficacy for chronic pancreatitis. By synergistically targeting key
mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the disease, this approach aims to optimize the management and outcomes of chronic pancreatitis. Here’s how targeted
nutrient synergy can enhance treatment efficacy for chronic pancreatitis:

1. ***Digestive Enzymes and*** ***Micronutrients:*** The supplementation of pancreatic

enzymes, along with targeted micronutrient supplementation, can address nutrient deficiencies and optimize nutrient absorption. Pancreatic enzyme supplements aid in the digestion and absorption of macronutrients, while micronutrients
such as fat-soluble vitamins, B vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants replenish
deficiencies and support pancreatic health (Lakananurak and Gramlich 2020).
2. ***Anti-Inflammatory Nutrients and Antioxidants:*** Chronic pancreatitis involves

inflammation and oxidative stress. By combining anti-inflammatory nutrients
such as omega-3 fatty acids, curcumin, and ginger with antioxidant nutrients like
vitamins C, E, and selenium, treatment can target both inflammatory processes
and oxidative damage, reducing pancreatic inflammation and protecting pancreatic cells from further injury (Ko et al. 2019).

techniques and strategies to find what suits you best. Remember, it is crucial to
integrate stress management into your overall treatment plan for chronic pancreatitis and work closely with your healthcare team to ensure comprehensive care.
###### **11 Conclusion**

Chronic pancreatitis is a complex and debilitating disease wherein its management
requires a multidisciplinary approach, with a focused treatment strategy to relieve
pain, enhance digestion and nutritional well-being, and prevent potential complications. Pain management in chronic pancreatitis often involves a combination of
medications, pancreatic enzyme supplements, and alternative approaches such as
nerve blocks, neuromodulation techniques, and psychological interventions.
However, nutritional support is crucial due to malabsorption and malnutrition associated with the disease. Thus, patients require specialized diets, depending upon
their conditions (low in fat, high in protein) and supplemented with pancreatic
enzymes. Moreover, diagnosing chronic pancreatitis is challenging which leads to
delays in appropriate treatment. The personalized nature of the disease and its
diverse presentation further complicate the establishment of standardized treatment
guidelines. Additionally, there is a lack of effective therapies that can halt or reverse
the progression of the disease, with current strategies primarily focused on symptom control and complication management. Nevertheless, researchers are actively
exploring potential therapeutic targets, such as anti-inflammatory agents, antioxidants, and other agents that promote pancreatic regeneration. Continued research
and advancements in understanding chronic pancreatitis are needed to improve
diagnostic accuracy, develop personalized treatment approaches, and ultimately
find interventions that can halt or even reverse the progression of this debilitating
disease.

###### **1 Introduction**

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of mortality and
mobility worldwide after cardiovascular diseases. A dramatic surge in the COPD
burden and comorbidities associated has been ascertained due to COVID-19 pandemic. COPD is defined as progressive obstruction in the lung airways on exposure
to toxic inhalants. COPD is caused by a mixture of pulmonary disorders such as
emphysema, obstructive bronchitis, and chronic inflammation in airways and parenchyma of lungs. The COPD symptoms includes persistent cough with sputum production and dyspnea. Tobacco and cigarette smoking, air pollution, inhalation of
toxic gases and chemicals are the major risk factors in the onset and development of
COPD (Adeloye et al. 2015; Singh et al. 2022; Collins et al. 2019). Even though
there are models to examine the variations in the inflammatory influx brought on by

this exposure (to smoke, fumes, and biomass), the pathogenetic pathways involved
in the onset and development of COPD have not yet been fully elucidated. In recent
years, the focus of researchers is to recognize and uncovers the risk factors and
genetic predisposition involved in the onset of COPD (Ingebrigtsen et al. 2011).
Genetically predisposed individuals who experience a non-reversible bronchial
blockage due to prolonged exposure to harmful gases and gaseous particles are at
high risk of developing COPD (Vogelmeier et al. 2017).

Progression of this disease negatively affects the quality of life and physic functioning of individual with a frequent hospitalization and high costs of healthcare
facilities. Numerous studies in recent decades have shown that the pathogenesis of
COPD is also influenced by the nutritional components of various diets. Poor diet
and nutrient deficiency are addition factors that worsen the recovery in COPD
patients. Additionally, recent research has started to highlight the potential role of
diet in altering gene expression through epigenetic changes that may predispose the
subject to developing a non-reversible bronchial obstruction (Adcock 2017). The
modification of DNA, lipids, or proteins as a result of lung damage caused by oxidative stress can start cellular responses that promote lung inflammation and lead to
tissue degradation.

The associations between diet and COPD addresses a complex interfacing network that might impact the presence of a persistent airway stress in COPD patients.
As a result, these interactions might also affect COPD treatment. Healthy eating
habits and adequate nutritional intake help reduce COPD-related oxidative stress,
pulmonary and systemic inflammation. Therefore, dietary intake of balanced and
essential nutrition’s is necessary to lower the risk of pulmonary failure and death
among COPD patients. Healthy dietary patterns and specific nutrient intake attenuates the oxidative stress, pulmonary and systemic inflammation associated with
COPD. The dietary guidelines for patients who are at risk of developing COPD are
consistent with the dietary guidelines for the general population. However, it is suggested to consume a diet that is low in fat, high in dietary fibre, complex carbohydrates, fruits, and vegetables. Dietary proposals in patients with cutting edge COPD
ought to be resolved independently for every patient, considering the level of hunger, as well as the financial states of individual patients (Collins et al. 2019; Mekal
et al. 2021). The chapter discusses in detail about the pathophysiology, progression
and treatment of COPD focussing on the association of dietary intake and decline
in COPD.
###### **2 Pathophysiology of COPD**

Pathophysiology of COPD deals with the physiological evolution and progression
of the disease. It is a heterogenous reversible disease caused by the long-term
obstruction and inflammation in the airways of lungs (Leap et al. 2021). Inhalation
of the toxic gases or noxious inhalants present in cigarettes causes inflammation in
the airways due to the immune response against the toxin. As a result of immune

response, an epithelial barrier prevents the entering of foreign substance through the
lungs and removes the pathogen from the upper airways. The humoral memory
response against the foreign toxic inhalant develops slowly. The process of invasion,
immune response, inflammation and remodelling of lung parenchyma on interaction with toxic inhalant leads to bronchiolitis, emphysema, chronic bronchitis and
subsequent development of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Hogg et al.
2004). Apart from cigarettes smoking, the other major risk factors of COPD involve
poor-lung growth due to aging, inflammatory response due to inhalation of toxic
agents, exposure to fumes, dust and chemical agents, air pollution burning of wood
and biomass fuels, and asthma (Lange et al. 2015; Eisner et al. 2010). SARS-Cov-2
has also appeared to be a major risk factor of morbidity and mortality in COPD
patients in the past two years. The clinical representation of COPD is highly variable. About 60% of COPD patients have a history of cigarette, smoking or inhalation of toxic gases for prolonged period. The commonly reported signs and
symptoms of COPD includes mucus production, chronic cough, obstruction in airway, dyspnea, low forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ), chest tightness
and whizzing. In severe cases of COPD emphysema in associated with chronic
bronchitis is also observed (Lange et al. 2015; Kessler et al. 2011). Chronic obstruction of airways often occurs as two overlapping chronic lung inflammatory process
(Fig. 8.1):

- Emphysema, a condition refers to the destruction of parenchymal, and loss of

alveolar units (air passages of lungs)

**Fig. 8.1** Pathophysiology of COPD

226


R. Soni et al.



- Chronic bronchitis, refers to the inflammation, mucus production and remodelling of bronchial tubes

Prolonged inflammation, oxidative stress, protease imbalance, signal transduction
pathways, and chronic inflammation leads to bronchial epithelial goblet cell metaplasia including submucosal bronchial gland hyperplasia and hypertrophy. The
obstructed airflow hastens the deterioration of lung function, that further increases
acute lung exacerbations. The mucus attachments block the lung airways routes and
cause steady colonization of the respiratory airway with bacterial pathogens.
Patients with ongoing bronchitis have lower physical activity and quality of life
(Tian and Wen 2015). Emphysema is the persistent, abnormal enlargement of the
respiratory airspaces, or alveoli, accompanied by destruction of the alveolar walls
without apparent macroscopic fibrosis. On microscopy, there are more CD8 T lymphocytes and macrophages. The loss of epithelial and endothelial cells damages
alveolar walls in addition to bulla, or emphysematous airspaces larger than 1 cm are
observed. The destruction of the alveolar walls results in the loss of the lungs’ elastic recoil. This prompts airflow hindrance, decreased regions for gas trade, and
expanded dead space (Berg and Wright 2016; Higham et al. 2019). Pulmonary
hypertension is also one of the significant reasons behind COPD comorbidity as it
develops in later stages of COPD. Intimal thickening of the arteries adjacent to the
bronchioles is caused by smooth muscle proliferation and the deposition of elastin
and collagen, which results in pulmonary arterial constriction in the presence of
chronic hypoxia. These arteries are unable to fully dilate in response to exercise,
acetylcholine, or an increase in airflow (Berg and Wright 2016).
###### ***2.1 Physiological Processes and COPD***

Several physiological processes contribute to the progression of COPD. These processes include local, systematic and eosinophil mediated inflammation, apoptosis,
alteration in cellular responses and destruction of lung parenchyma. Majority of
COPD patients have an accelerated systematic inflammatory response that cause an
increase in the levels of immune cells (T-lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils) in the lung airways. Few cohorts of COPD patients have eosinophil-mediated
inflammation. The inflammatory responses secrete inflammatory biomarkers (cytokines and chemotactic factors) that further progress the severity of COPD. Neutrophils
and macrophages secrete leukotriene B4, IL-8, oncogenes-α, CXC chemokines
stimulate the T-cells activation, neutrophil infiltration, and cellular migration.
Proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-β and TNF-α) and growth factors are released
that cause inflammatory injury, subsequent scarring and lung fibrosis. Cardiac failure and poor-prognosis are observed in case of persistent systematic inflammation
in COPD patients (Duffy and Criner 2019; MacNee 2006). Oxidative stress modulates the DNA, lipids and proteins, initiating a cascade of cellular and inflammatory
responses releasing proteases, elastase, cathepsin A, E, L, G and S,


-----

227


metalloproteinases. The inflammatory response triggers the activation of redox-­
sensitive transcription factors like unfolded protein response, induction of autophagy, and nuclear factor (NF)-B. These proteases cause mucus production, alveolar
and lung tissue destruction thereof. Elevated serum levels of IL-6 and C-reactive
protein (CRP) are associated with the high risk of COPD and loss of lung function
in individuals with a history of smoking (Szmidt et al. 2020).
###### ***2.2 Environmental and Genetic Causes of COPD***

In addition to smoking, poor ventilation and cooking fumes from indoor wood
stoves, environmental pollution, dust and gases from underground tunnel workers
from coal and gold mining, gas from cadmium mining have all been linked to an
increase in COPD prevalence. Patients with lower socioeconomic status are more
likely to develop the disease (Higham et al. 2019). About 80% of COPD cases prevail dur to cigarette smoking. However, only 15–20% smokers develop COPD, suggesting the involvement of genetic factors in COPD development. Free radicals in
cigarettes damage the lungs through oxidative stress. COPD may be caused by
defects in the mechanisms that protect against this damage. Epigenetics changes in
humans are associated with both the environment and genetic changes. It is found
that epigenetics is involved in the pathogenesis of COPD. Several studies have demonstrated that in lung tissue, sputum and blood, abnormal changes in miRNAs,
chromatin remodelling, histone modifications, and DNA methylation are present in
COPD patients. Subsequently, persistent respiratory circumstances have epigenetic
markers that upholds the advancement of novel respiratory medication diagnostics
and therapeutics (Yang and Schwartz 2011). The epigenetic mechanisms and their
associated signalling pathways in COPD can be regulated through the beneficial
impacts of nutrient. Numerous studies demonstrated that nutrients can regulate transcription and translational processes and alter the structure of chromatin, thus
affecting metabolic traits. This field of study known as nutriepigenomics or nutritional epigenomics studies dealing with preventive measures of nutrients in COPD
via epigenetic regulation (Cherneva and Kostadinov 2019). Moreover, Low BMI is
associated with the poor prognosis in COPD patients (Higham et al. 2019). ***2.3 COPD and Gut-Lung Axis***

Microbiota of our whole body and the gut have developed a strong symbiotic relationship that is essential for maintaining health, vitamin synthesis, nutrient metabolism, prevention of pathogen colonisation, and immune response control. Despite
having similar embryonic origin, gut and lung differ anatomically and microbiologically. The transient microorganisms that make up the lung microbiota mostly
come from the upper respiratory tract (URT), which includes the nose, oropharynx,


-----

228


R. Soni et al.


nasopharynx, paranasal sinuses, and nasal passages. However, a balanced microbiota in gut and lungs is necessary for the regulation of immune system and overall
growth of the body. Gut-lung axis is defined as the cross-talk between the lungs and
gut microbes. The bloodstream links the microbiota of the gut and lung, making it
easier for microbial metabolites, hormones, cytokines, and endotoxins to interact
with one another (Jandhyala et al. 2015; Mjösberg and Rao 2018; Qu et al. 2022a).
The pathophysiology of COPD is significantly influenced by imbalances in the
microbiota of the lungs and the gut. Asthma, malnutrition, smoking, chronic lung
infections and medications all have the potential to affect the microbiota in both the
gut and lungs. The gut-lung axis is disrupted in COPD, which results in a dysfunctional immune response, disturbances in metabolites, increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, altered microbiota composition, microbiota diversity, and
poor lung infection clearance or gastrointestinal symptoms or diseases. Use of antibiotics in COPD patients disturbs the long-term micro flora of both gut and lungs,
thereby increasing the antibiotic resistance. COPD is profoundly connected with the
dysbiosis in the stomach and lungs, which can be actuated by epigenetic changes or
managed through NLRP3 inflammasome (Sun et al. 2020; Qu et al. 2022b). Zang L
study reports that respiratory infection and COPD, asthma, cystic fibrosis, emphysema diseases such as can be prevented by intervening the gut microbiota with natural products, balanced diet, nutrient supplementation, and probiotics (Zhang
et al. 2020).
###### **3 Malnutrition and COPD**

Malnutrition refers to an imbalance (deficiency or excess) of nutrients and energy
levels in the human body. Decreased nutritional intake and an increased bodily need
for vitamins, minerals, energy, and proteins refers to malnutrition (Stratton et al.
2003). The risk and prevalence of malnutrition are higher in COPD patients. An
increase in the chances of weight and nutrient loss is directly proportional to the
COPD severity among COPD patients (Ingadottir et al. 2018). Cachexia and
Sarcopenia are two conditions that develop in patients with prolonged stable COPD
with nutritional deficiency (Collins et al. 2010; Jones et al. 2015). Cachexia is
defined as a yearly weight loss of 5% accompanied by anorexia, fatigue, decrease in
the fat-free mass index (FFMI), and muscle strength increased. It is quite common
in COPD patients and is referred to as pulmonary cachexia. BMI and FFMI in
COPD patients are quite low, thus contributing to the poor prognosis and increases
hospital stay. Serious consequences are observed in decreased levels of
FFM. Whereas Sarcopenia is a regular sickness of COPD patients and is defined by
low skeletal muscle strength and mass. About 16% of COPD patients are sarcopenic, while 20–40% exhibit decline in muscle mass only. Notably, mortality is higher
in COPD patients in case of MSS (malnutrition-sarcopenia syndrome) when both
the conditions are combined (Cederholm et al. 2019). Sarcopenia, weight loss, muscle loss and malnutrition contribute to an increase in fatality among COPD patients

and a high protein diet with cereals and fibres have proven to elevate this COPD
severity. Thus, a nutrition-based treatment for COPD may be a viable non-­
pharmaceutical strategy for managing the disease progression.

Patients with COPD may also develop osteoporosis as a result of anorexia, which
causes them to consume fewer dairy products and engage in less physical activity
daily. Osteoporosis is also highly prevalent among COPD patients. Low bone mineral density and low serum vitamin D levels are strongly correlated in COPD
patients. The regulation of calcium metabolism depends on vitamin D. Patients with
pulmonary fibrosis and other pulmonary conditions have also been found to have
decreased lung function due to low serum levels of vitamin D. Serum levels of the
GC-globulin (GC gene-encoded vitamin D binding protein (VDBP)), appear to
have an impact on vitamin D levels. VDBP stabilizes the vitamin D molecule ensuring its transportation to the target tissues due to very short lifespan if Vitamin D in
serum. The role of this carrier protein is unclear in declining the lung function;
however, it regulates immunological responses like the chemotaxis of neutrophils
and macrophage activation (Franco et al. 2009; Tramontano and Palange 2023).
Figure 8.2 briefly illustrates the mechanism of malnutrition in COPD patients.
These factors contribute to malnutrition and subsequently increase rate of mortality
and morbidity in COPD individuals. Medications, low-grade systemic inflammation, tissue hypoxia, muscle loss and atrophy, aging and changes in metabolism are
the primary factors that contribute to nutritional impairment and poor muscle

energetics in COPD patients. The chronic obstruction in the airways causes difficulty in breathing as a result the COPD patient is in a hypermetabolism state with
an increased resting energy metabolism consuming more calories. As a result of an
obstruction in airflow and increased load on breathing, blood flow to the critical
organs (heart, ventilatory muscles, central nervous system) is maintained by the
body. This results in the development of hypoxia and nutrition-deficient condition
in the skeleton tissues, thus weakening muscle strength and bones. Hypoxia
adversely influence muscle capability in association with the ongoing hypoxemia
and the frequently concurrent paleness that promotes further muscle hypoxia
because of a decrease in oxygen conveyance that led to elevated protein turnover
and lacking muscle regeneration. Muscle endurance is affected by impaired muscle
mass and oxidative capacity as a result of all these mechanisms (Tramontano and
Palange 2023).

Aging is directly linked to the free-fat mass loss, particularly muscle tissue.
Diminished muscle strength and basal metabolic rate due to depletion in muscle
mass result in a decreased physical movement and exercise. A reduction in nutritious diet altogether results in loss of appetite, systemic inflammation and physical
activity (Tramontano and Palange 2023; Langen et al. 2013; Schols et al. 1991;
Barreiro and Gea 2016). Systematic inflammation occurs in COPD patients due to
the increased serum levels of inflammatory markers such as chemokines, TNF-α,
IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8. Several studies have reported that an increased level of IL-6 is
directly linked to loss of appetite, and weight loss is associated with elevated levels
serum levels of TNF-α among COPD patients (Barreiro and Gea 2016; Rawal and
Yadav 2015). IL-6, TNF-α, Leptin, and adiponectin are some of the bioactive proteins secreted by adipocytes that are referred to as adipokines. It has been demonstrated in COPD individuals, a low-grade systemic inflammation is caused by
dysregulation of adipokines, also they are influencing nutritional status and regulate
appetite (Breyer et al. 2012).

Malnutrition in COPD patients is treated with glucocorticoid medication.
However, nutritional intervention-based therapy has proven to be more effective in
maintaining the appetite and muscle strength in COPD patients. An increase in the
nutrient supply to the body increases body weight by improving muscle efficiency,
and respiratory muscles and suppresses the inflammatory response. This prevents
further progression and exacerbations of COPD (Rawal and Yadav 2015; Mete et al.
2018). In COPD patients with malnutrition, traditional high-carbohydrate diet is
avoided and a high protein and fat is preferred. High protein in the diet significantly
improves the growth and strength of skeletal muscles (Rawal and Yadav 2015).
Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids anti-inflammatory properties and antioxidants
in fruits highly reduce the inflammatory response in COPD patients. Vitamin supplementation (Vit A, C, and E) efficiently elevate COPD symptoms and improves its
prognosis. Immunomodulatory effects of Vitamin D improve the muscle’s overall
strength (Mete et al. 2018). A diet with a small frequent nutritional meal, and multivitamin supplementation in association with Pulmonary rehabilitation (physical
exercise, yoga) is a recommended treatment for malnutrition in COPD patients.

###### **4 Dietary Nutrients as Metabolic Modulator in COPD** ***4.1 Fruits and Vegetables***


231


The dietary quality, nutritional status, and oxidative-inflammatory pathogenic
underpinnings of COPD provided the justification for confirming the benefits of
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory dietary components for the respiratory system.
Consistent epidemiologic evidence from longitudinal and cross-sectional studies
reported potential beneficial effects of a high intake of antioxidant nutrients, and of
foods rich in antioxidants, mostly fresh, hard fruits and, to a lesser extent, vegetables, on lung function and decline in incidence of COPD associated mortality
(Rodríguez-Rodríguez et al. 2016; Walda et al. 2002; Kaluza et al. 2018; Scoditti
et al. 2019) (Table 8.1).

After one week of diet supplementation of Beetroot juice, a dietary source of
nitrates improved the mitochondrial respiration and energy production via nitric
oxide formation, increased plasma nitrate levels and decreased diastolic blood pressure in COPD patients, though no effects on submaximal exercise’s oxygen consumption, physical activity level, or walking capacity was observed (Friis et al.
2017). Nonetheless, one more randomized preliminary detailed that COPD patients
following an eating routine wealthy in leafy foods showed a yearly expansion in
FEV1 contrasted and the benchmark group following a free eating routine north of
3 years (p = 0.03), after change for actual work, liquor consumption, co-morbidities,

and fuel recurrence (Keranis et al. 2010). These findings suggest that fruit and vegetable consumption is a significant factor in pulmonary function and COPD risk. It
is important to note that eating fresh fruit may be one part of a healthier lifestyle that
also includes less smoking, more exercise, eating less Western food (like meat) and
more vegetables.
###### ***4.2 Vitamin C***

Oxidative overload in COPD is quite common and is typically brought on by infection and hypoxia. Oxidative overload plays a crucial role in the impairment and
remodelling of lung tissue. Emphysema in COPD is primarily caused by dysregulated antiproteases in lung tissue caused by elevated oxidative stress. Vitamin C is a
potent antioxidant that is commonly consumed as a natural supplement and dietary
intake of Vitamin C, is associated with the higher levels of FEV1. Many in vivo and
clinical based research studies over the past years have showed that Vitamin C has
high potential in elevating COPD exacerbations and improving the overall function
of lungs. According to in vitro data from endothelial cell lines, vitamin C could
block the production of IL-8 and inhibit NF-B activation by IL-1 and TNF-α by
means that were not dependent on the antioxidant activity of vitamin C (Bowie and
O'Neill 2000). Observational examinations in youngsters showed utilization of
fruits rich in L-ascorbic acid (Vitamin-C), directly related to diminished wheezing
(Forastiere et al. 2000). Experimental and observational research suggests that
Vitamin C plays an important role in the COPD pathogenesis and progression. A
study by Koike et al. found that vitamin C supplementation prevented smoke-­
induced emphysema, reduced oxidative stress, and restored damaged lung tissue in
knock-out mice that were unable to synthesize vitamin C (Koike et al. 2014). Also,
in one of the epidemiological studies conducted in the United Kingdom of over
7000 grown-ups aged 45–74 times reported that increase in plasma concentration of
Vitamin-C has preventive effects in COPD patients by lowering the risk of obstructive airways (Sargeant et al. 2000). Vitamin C is important for lung function and
intake of vitamin C-rich whole foods like fruit and vegetables is effective in reducing the COPD exacerbations. Vitamin C in association with Vitamin E protect lungs
against oxidative damage reducing COPD related moralities. Vitamin C supplementation in COPD patients improves their nutritional status by promoting lung function and serum antioxidant levels by decreasing oxidative damage to the lung. ***4.3 Vitamin D***

Epidemiological investigations show promising relationship between vitamin D and
lung wellbeing; However, little is known about the mechanisms that underlie these
effects. Vitamin D can be obtained through food or through supplements; sunlight

233


being the fundamental source of vitamin D levels (van Iersel et al. 2022). Low levels
of vitamin D in the blood are linked to decreased lung function, increased use of
corticosteroids, and more frequent exacerbations in children. Studies have shown a
correlation between higher intake of vitamin D and improved lung function, as evidenced by higher FEV1 and lower prevalence of COPD in the general population.
Conversely, individuals with lower serum vitamin D levels, especially smokers,
were found to have increased odds of developing COPD. Vitamin D deficiency was
linked to decreased FEV1 and FVC in certain populations, with variations noted
between genders and medical condition (Afzal et al. 2014). While several studies
have reported positive associations between serum vitamin D levels and FEV1 in
various populations, some cross-sectional studies did not confirm these findings.
Prospective analyses, however, revealed that lower vitamin D concentrations were
associated with a faster decline in lung function over time and a higher risk of developing COPD. In patients with COPD, studies consistently showed lower dietary
intake and serum levels of vitamin D compared to healthy individuals. Vitamin D
deficiency was inversely associated with lung function parameters in COPD patients,
and supplementation appeared to have beneficial effects, particularly in those who
were deficient (Sluyter et al. 2017).

Overall, while evidence is mixed regarding the association between vitamin D
intake and serum levels and the risk of COPD in the general population, there is
strong evidence supporting the beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation on
lung function decline in COPD patients, especially in those with existing deficiency.
###### ***4.4 Whole Grains***

Intake of Whole grains in a diet are beneficial for maintaining good lung health and
preventing COPD associated mortality. Whole grains are plentiful in selenium, vitamin E, flavonoids, phytic corrosive, phenolic acids, and fundamental unsaturated
fats, which may additively or synergistically add to wholegrains’ beneficiary impact
on both the respiratory and non-respiratory illnesses (Adeloye et al. 2015). Fibre
present in Whole grains, fruits, and vegetables contribute to their antioxidant and
anti-inflammatory. Optimal level of fibre intake in diet is directly associated with
the high serum levels of Adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing adipocytokine having
anti-inflammatory properties, and lower serum levels of cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α)
and C-Reactive protein (CRP) (Singh et al. 2022; Collins et al. 2019). Intake of
higher fibre diet decreases the prevalence of COPD by 40% in a large cohort of the
population. Considered in terms of the types of fibre (fruit, vegetables, and cereals),
the beneficial association specifically among current smokers and ex-smokers was
found to be strongest in diet having cereal fibre (Ingebrigtsen et al. 2011).

###### ***4.5 Coffee***


R. Soni et al.


Coffee’s widespread use has sparked a growing interest in its potential contribution
to respiratory health. Coffee’s constituents, caffeine and polyphenols, have been
linked to improvements in lung function and decreased mortality from respiratory
diseases, but less in case of COPD patients. Caffeine has anti-inflammatory properties and acts as a bronchodilator improving respiratory health. Phenolic compounds
in coffee have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory activity that further add to its contribution to a healthy lung function (Vogelmeier et al. 2017).
###### ***4.6 PUFAs***

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are a part of n-3 (omega-3) family that includes
linolenic acid, its long-chain derivatives docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid. The endogenous production of omega-3 fatty acids is quite low and its
nutritional intake relies upon exogenous sources. The main source of PUFAs are
seafoods and fish. Omega-3 fatty acids have potent anti-inflammatory properties
that have beneficial effects in several diseases including COPD, cardiovascular disease, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes (Adcock 2017). Metabolism of
PUFAs produces leukotriene, prostaglandin and eicosanoids which are strong mediators of bronco-constriction, thrombosis, vaso-constriction, and inflammation.
Cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are highly expressed in the lungs, produce some
fatty acid compounds such as EPA and DHA metabolites that are potent anti-­
inflammators, bronchodilators, and vasodilators. The eicosanoids resolvins and protectins, metabolites of long-chain n-3 PUFAs, eliminates inflammatory mediators
and promote healing of inflamed lung parenchyma tissue (Mekal et al. 2021).

The synthesis of generally less biologically active eicosanoids is favoured after
the dietary intake of n-3 PUFA that is further accompanied by a partial substitution
of n-6 PUFA in cell membranes, thereby competing for the metabolizing enzymes.
Apart from the synthesis of beneficial lipid metabolites, n-3 PUFA mediates anti-­
inflammatory by the direct regulation of inflammatory gene expression (cyclooxygenase-­2, matrix degrading enzymes, cytokines, and adhesion molecules) through
nuclear transcription factors regulation (pro-inflammatory NF-B), which is involved
in the pathogenesis of lung inflammation. **5 COPD and Dietary Patterns**

All the essential nutrients have the ability to regulate the oxidative stress and inflammatory processes that contributes to the onset of COPD, thus making them potential
future therapeutic targets. Studies have demonstrated a link between certain dietary


-----

235


habits and the risk of COPD. However, specific dietary modifications as a clinically
relevant tool to promote lung health and congruently indicated that the pattern of
dietary intake is an important factor in the pathogenesis and prevention of
COPD. Cross sectional and cohort studies typically use food questionnaires to collect diet-related data, which may not be as accurate as circulating concentrations.
On the other hand, because it incorporates the variety, quantities, proportions, and a
combination of the various foods and beverages that are included in the diet, the
analysis of dietary patterns may be more effective than that of individual nutrients
(Table 8.2). Also, the evaluation of the effects of individual food and nutrient intake
on COPD is also enhanced by examining dietary patterns. As diet and its nutrients
vary from region to region, dietary patterns may vary, preventing comparisons
between nations and continents (Scoditti et al. 2019; Friis et al. 2017). A diet high
in fruits, vegetables, fish, and whole-grain products is a hallmark of a healthy diet.
This dietary pattern has been linked to a lower risk of COPD. Diets high in fruits
and vegetables have a positive correlation with FEV1 and FVC in the general population and daily fish consumption reduced FEV1 decline. A lower prevalence of
COPD has been linked to higher scores in a healthy dietary pattern. In another
cohort study by Kaluza et al. (2018) on mammography founds that woman who
consumed more fruit per day had a lower risk of COPD than women who consumed
less fruit. Moreover, it was observed that consuming vegetables for an extended
period of time did not maintain this risk difference (Bowie and O'Neill 2000).
###### ***5.1 Western Diet***

A higher incidence of COPD has been linked to western diet pattern that emphasizes food intake of refined grains, red and processed meats, chips, eggs, and flavoured drinks. Cured and red meats, desserts, and refined grains are all examples of

**Table 8.2** Dietary pattern and outcome in COPD patients

Scoditti et al. (2019), Friis et al. (2017), Keranis et al. (2010)

|Dietary pattern|Nutrients involved|Outcome|
|---|---|---|
|Western diet|Processed meat (cured, red meat), coffee, fat, boiled vegetables, eggs, cereals, salt, beer, potatoes, refined grains and sugar, chips and fizzy drinks|Respiratory symptoms (cough, phlegm, wheeze), FEV1, FEV1/FVC, COPD prevalence|
|DASH dietary|Sweetened beverages, salt, whole grains, processed red meat, nuts, legumes, fruits and vegetables|COPD and cough|
|“Meat dim sum” dietary pattern|Eggs, rice, desserts preserved food, processed red meat and noodle-based dishes|Cough and phlegm|
|Mediterranean diet|Red wine, nuts, legumes, fish, dairy products, fruits and vegetables, extra virgin olive oil, seafood, poultry.|Oxidative stress, inflammatory response and impaired lung function|

western diet foods that contributes to the development of COPD. Consuming processed meat has been linked to a high risk of COPD exacerbation readmission. The
Western diet has been linked to frequent complaints of wheezing, coughing, and
phlegm, as well as a decline in COPD patients’ lung function and lower predicted
concentrations of FEV1 and FVC and the ratio of FEV1/FVC. Likewise, an eating
regimen wealthy in cereals, refined sugars, salt, and lager moreover is related with
lower FEV1, a more serious risk for COPD, and a critical decrease in lung capability (Scoditti et al. 2019; Forastiere et al. 2000).

This positive association between COPD risk and Western-style dietary patterns
may have been generated by multiple mechanisms, even though the role of processed meat in the pathogenesis of COPD is largely unknown and there are no
definitive mechanistic studies. In the first place, handled or restored meat has a high
level of nitrosamine and nitrate or nitrite compounds. These nitrites might cause
DNA harm, hindrance of mitochondrial breath, and nitrosative pressure by expanding provocative cycles in the lung parenchyma and aviation routes related with this
nitrosative pressure. Eminently, this cycle can have advantageous impacts at physiological focuses by shielding the vascular tissues from incendiary cells. A beneficial
effect of dietary nitrite on the destruction of the alveolar structure and subsequent
inflammation of the airways was found in a mouse study. As a result, pulmonary
emphysema, which is characterized by proteolytic destruction of the alveolar structure, was prevented from developing by these nutrients.

Second, Western diets are low in n-3 PUFAs and high in n-6 PUFAs and saturated fatty acids (SFAs). Increased systemic inflammation has been linked to a
decline in pulmonary function when SFAs and trans fats are consumed. The utilization of pentadecanoic corrosive (C15:0), an odd chain SFA, usefully affected
patients with COPD, working on the FEV1/FVC proportion. This fatty acid is considered a biomarker of fat consumption in dairy products, particularly milk, which
contains approximately 1.2% pentadecanoic acid, and it is found in lower concentrations in fish, lamb, and beef. In addition, the Western diet, which is high in high-­
energy macronutrients and high in SFA and n-6 PUFA, encourages obesity, which
is bad for health. SFA and n-6 PUFA have negative effects on inflammation and are
linked to asthma and other lung diseases (Koike et al. 2014).
###### ***5.2 Dietary Pattern “Meat—Dim-Sum”***

The “meat—dim-sum” diet emphasizes the consumption of rice, noodles, preserved
foods, pork, chicken, and fish. Subjects who followed a “meat—dim-sum” dietary
pattern had a higher risk of coughing up phlegm in a male and female population.
Consuming a lot of different kinds of meat raises the risk of COPD (Sargeant
et al. 2000).


-----

###### ***5.3 Mediterranean Diet***


237


Having a high intake of extra virgin olive oil, fruit, vegetables, fresh produce, nuts,
and legumes; a low intake of red meat and prepared foods; and a moderate intake of
fish and seafood, poultry, fermented dairy products, and red wine (with meals) are
all characteristics of the Mediterranean diet. This eating pattern favours poly- and
monounsaturated fats, especially those derived from the oleic acid found in olive
oil, over “trans” and saturated fats, which are higher in cholesterol. It is also rich in
phytoestrogens, folates, and selenium (Rondanelli et al. 2020) Over the past ten
years, a correlation between lung function and adherence to the Mediterranean diet
has been noted. Low FVC and FEV1 values in smokers and older persons, as well
as a higher prevalence of decreased lung function, have been linked to poor adherence to the Mediterranean diet. It has been demonstrated that several elements of
this dietary pattern, including fruit and vegetables, vitamins C and E, flavonoids,
ß-carotene, fatty acids, and various minerals, have a protective influence on oxidative and inflammatory processes and may also have a protective effect on lung function (Rondanelli et al. 2020). It is well-known that N-3 PUFAs are important
nutrients with a variety of physiological roles as well as positive impacts on health,
such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidative qualities. Consuming n-3 PUFAs
(eicosapentanoic acid and docosahexanoic acid), which are found in fatty fish (such
as tuna, mackerel, and salmon) and in the oil derived from these species, may help
to slow the decline in respiratory function.

Finally, compared to a Western diet high in saturated fat, the Mediterranean diet
intake over a 4-week period reduced serum levels of advanced glycation end products. Lower spirometric values and abnormal ventilatory patterns were linked to the
deposition of these products. The effect of the Mediterranean diet on lung function
revealed sexual dimorphism, with healthy women’s central airways being smaller
than men’s, and female smokers’ FEV1 declines being more pronounced than those
of male smokers (Scoditti et al. 2019).
###### ***5.4 DASH Diet***

The DASH dietary pattern is the example of a one of the major healthy eating patterns, calls for a higher intake of fruit, legumes, vegetables, nuts, low fat dairy products, and whole grains and a lower intake of red meat, processed foods, sweetened
beverages, and salt. A case-control study showed that COPD patients adhered to a
DASH diet pattern less frequently than the control group without COPD. Respiratory
function tests did not reveal a significant difference across tertials of a DASH diet,
even though patients with COPD had FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC concentrations
that were significantly lower compared with the control group prior to the intervention research. Adherence to a DASH dietary pattern only considerably reduced
cough as a symptom (Walda et al. 2002).

###### **6 Conclusion**


R. Soni et al.


Identification of modifiable risk factors for COPD prevention and therapy is highly
demanded given the alarmingly rising incidence of COPD worldwide. Based on the
information now available, increased knowledge of nutrition and dietary determinants affecting respiratory health may be of importance for public health due to
their implications on disease modification. There are many chances for changes and
interventions given how poorly the existing dietary practises in the general population and in people with respiratory diseases are reported to be. A two-hit lifestyle
burden (smoking and an unhealthy diet) is presently on the rise due to the rising
smoking habit in emerging nations and the inexorable global phenomena of
Westernisation of lifestyle variables, which includes a more processed and
convenience-­oriented diet. Numerous scientific organisations endorse the
cautious/Mediterranean diets as good eating patterns because of the significant evidence linking them to enhanced cardiometabolic health, including a decreased risk
of CV disease, diabetes, and obesity. Published studies also consistently demonstrate the detrimental effects of the Western diet, which is high in refined foods,
saturated fat, meat, and sugar, on lung function and the risk of developing COPD. In
contrast, specific dietary factors and diets, primarily the prudent/Mediterranean
diets, which are high in plant-based foods and healthy fats, have been shown to
preserve lung function and reduce the risk of developing COPD or its long-term
progression. It’s interesting to note that the size of diet’s influence on lung function
is reportedly equivalent to that of chronic smoking (van Iersel et al. 2022), highlighting the possibility that good dietary practises may have a significant impact on
the development of COPD as well as the related metabolic and CV risk. Asthma risk
and lung function were positively impacted by particular dietary patterns and/or
nutrients in several trials, but not COPD risk or asthma, which clearly suggests a
genuine underlying effect rather thana generalised and most likely confounded
effect. While asthma has an immunological aetiology, COPD and CV disorders both
have a systemic inflammatory pathophysiology. Therefore, nutritional targeting of
oxidative balance and extreme inflammation may provide a special opportunity to
preventor cure COPD and its associated cardiovascular co-morbidities. To establish
the efficacy and mechanisms of food in preventing and treating COPD, further animal research and human intervention trials are required. The manipulation of the
microbiota by food is a recent field of study that has promise for improving health
and reducing illness risk. To address the inter-individual variability in response to
food and enhance a personalised nutrition intervention to prevent/treat COPD, the
field of nutrigenetics (i.e., the interaction between genetic variations and diet) also
merits consideration.

In conclusion, the multifaceted interplay between nutrition, lifestyle factors, and
respiratory health, particularly in the context of COPD prevention and management,
underscores the significance of dietary interventions as a critical component of public health strategies. The escalating global incidence of COPD, coupled with the
pervasive adoption of Westernized dietary patterns, necessitates urgent attention to

the role of nutrition in mitigating disease burden. While smoking cessation and
pharmacologic therapies remain cornerstone interventions in COPD management,
the integration of dietary modifications represents a pivotal frontier in disease prevention and management. Embracing holistic approaches that encompass lifestyle
modifications, including dietary interventions, holds promise for alleviating the burgeoning global burden of COPD and improving respiratory health outcomes. By
harnessing the potential of nutrition as a modifiable risk factor, concerted efforts can
be directed towards mitigating the socioeconomic and healthcare burdens associated with COPD worldwide.

##### **Chapter 9**
#### **Nutraceuticals in Inflammatory ** **Autoimmune Diseases**

**Lovely M. Annamma, Sabrin Ali Azim, and Naglaa S. Ashmawy**
###### **1 Introduction**

A broad category of illnesses known as autoimmune disorders (AD) are caused by
the body’s immune system attacking its own tissues. The body’s natural defensive
mechanism views its own cells as alien body cells in those disorders. This mistaken
attack on the normal cells causes various body organs to be affected. There are over
80 types of autoimmune disorders. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis
(MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD), and psoriasis are the most prevalent inflammatory autoimmune illnesses. Both the pathogenesis and the etiology of AD are currently poorly
understood. Environmental and genetic variables work together to set off the development of inflammatory autoimmune disorders (Genetic risk and a primary role for
cell-mediated immune mechanisms in multiple sclerosis 2011; Cotsapas and
Hafler 2013).
While medical interventions play a crucial role in managing these conditions,
emerging research highlights the impact of nutrition and diet on disease progression, severity of the symptoms, and the overall quality of life (Manzel et al. 2014).

The relationship between inflammatory autoimmune diseases and nutrition has
shown a growing interest among researchers as well as clinicians. It is now widely
recognized that dietary factors can modulate the immune system, affect inflammation levels, and significantly contribute to disease development or attenuation
(Vieira et al. 2014). Understanding the interplay between nutrition and autoimmune
diseases holds promise for optimizing patient care through targeted dietary
interventions.

This book chapter aims to investigate the complex connections between inflammatory autoimmune diseases and nutrition, exploring the scientific evidence linking
dietary components, such as specific nutrients, bioactive compounds, and dietary
patterns, to disease outcomes. By examining the latest research findings, we seek to
shed light on how nutrition and different diet regimens can influence the inflammatory processes underlying autoimmune diseases and impact disease progression,
symptom management, and even the risk of developing additional comorbidities.
Additionally, the potential mechanisms through which specific dietary factors exert
their effects on the immune system and inflammation pathways will be explored.

Additionally, the book chapter will evaluate critically the state of nutritional
therapies now used in the management and control of autoimmune disorders that are
inflammatory, covering the data supporting dietary changes, supplements, and the
function of specialty diets.. We will also address challenges and gaps in research,
emphasizing the need for further investigations and clinical trials to establish robust
dietary recommendations for patients.

As the scientific understanding of the relationship between nutrition and inflammatory autoimmune diseases continues to expand, it becomes increasingly important to bridge the gap between research findings and clinical practice. By enhancing
our knowledge in this field, we can empower healthcare professionals, patients, and
individuals at risk of developing these conditions to make informed choices about
their diet and lifestyle, potentially improving disease outcomes and overall
well-being.

As various reports have studied the effects of nutrients and the diet type on the
development and progression of AD. This chapter could be to highlight the latest
evidence-based nutrient management options for the most commonly occurring
inflammatory autoimmune disorders.
###### **2 Effect of Diet Type on Autoimmune Diseases**

It was reported that autoimmune diseases have a higher prevalence in Western societies in comparison to developing countries and the Eastern world. It was observed
that socioeconomic improvement is associated directly with the consumption of
high amounts of Western diet which led to a higher prevalence of autoimmune diseases (Venter et al. 2020; Rose 2016).

There are many reasons explaining the relationship between the Western diet and
AD development. High standards of hygiene are always found in Western countries

which reduces the occurrence of infection diseases, but this also can limit the exposure to beneficial microbes which play significant part for the suitable functioning
of the defense mechanism (Bach 2002; Okada et al. 2010; Rook 2012). Furthermore,
lifestyle factors such as psychosocial stress as well as smoking may act as additional
risk factors for autoimmune diseases. It was reported that the lack of physical activity, together with high-calorie consumption through fast food, contributes to the
high prevalence of obesity and AD in developed societies (Manzel et al. 2014).

Western diet (WD) is a term referring to certain dietary habits where foods of
high fats, cholesterol, simple sugars, proteins, salts as well as processed food are
consumed (Gioia et al. 2020). While the Mediterranean diet (MD) as defined by
UNESCO in 2010 it is not limited to a dietary regimen, but it involves a collection
of cultural traditions to establish sound nutrition as the foundation of a healthy life
pattern from all perspectives. MD is described as a diet with high amounts of olive
oil, vegetables, fruits as well as whole grains together with a controlled intake of
fish, meat, as well as dairy products. MD incorporates also various spices, condiments, and water (Mazzucca et al. 2021).

The mechanisms by which specific nutrients alter immune function and have an
anti-inflammatory effect activity have been extensively reported. Certain nutrients
like polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) which are abundant in sea food as well as
plant oil seeds have been reported to decrease inflammation by reducing cytokine
production and leukocyte migration (Kostoglou-Athanassiou et al. 2020).

Moreover, a diet which is abundant in fruits and vegetables can provide the body
with polyphenols, which are commonly found in tea, coffee, as well as some
legumes. Epigallocatechin gallate, capsaicin, and curcumin are common examples
of polyphenols having potent anti-inflammatory characteristics. Those compounds
can modulate pathways for signaling that control the expression of genes known as
the pro-inflammatory, like cyclooxygenase (COX), phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and
lipoxygenase (LOX). Numerous studies have been carried out to evaluate the beneficial effects of these polyphenols on the autoimmune diseases (ADs) (Nelson
et al. 2020).

Isoflavones, another type of polyphenol, found in soybeans, black beans, and
olive oil have been also reported for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant characteristics and help alleviate inflammatory symptoms (Klack et al. 2012; Terahara
2015). Additionally, minerals, found naturally in milk, soybean, and mollusks as
zinc and selenium have been shown to improve symptoms of AD by decreasing
antibodies levels such as anti-dsDNA (Klack et al. 2012; Constantin et al. 2019).

The abundant ingestion of vegetables, fruits, as well as whole grains in the diet
of the Mediterranean (MD) is very advantageous because of its richness in fiber
content, which is essential to supporting the gut microbiome. While fiber itself is
not considered as a direct source of energy for humans, it undergoes bacterial fermentation in the gut, producing fatty acids which serve as an energy substrate for
colonocytes, thus protecting the intestinal barrier integrity (García-Montero et al.
2021). The microbiota derived from fatty acids have a significant impact on the
growth and differentiation of regulatory T cells, which are vital for maintaining the
immunological balance.. Dietary composition has a major impact on the

communication that occurs between the microbiota and the immune system of the
body (Arpaia et al. 2013).

It was reported that in the Mediterranean region, the consumption of processed
food as well as food additives has been expanding especially in young generations
in comparison to elderly people who prefer to stick to the Mediterranean diet
(Castelló et al. 2022; Russo et al. 2021).
###### **3 Mechanisms by Which the Western Diet Affects AD** ***3.1 Effect of Western Diet on Gut Microbiome and Regulation *** ***of T Cells***

There is an increase in the incidence of AD in the last three decades which may be
caused by the increased intestinal permeability resulted from the consumption of
fast food as well as industrial food additives (Mazzucca et al. 2021). This increase
in permeability led to the entrance of food toxins, bacteria and immunogenic antigens (Aaron et al. 2019). Moreover, the absence of fibers in the Western diet leads
to deprivation of the intestinal gut microbiota which will stimulate the induction of
the enzymes that cause the intestinal mucin layer to break down, resulting in a condition known as “leaky gut” (Desai et al. 2016). This condition induces an autoimmune response, through different mechanisms, among them the molecular similarity
either through the interaction of self-molecules with certain chemical products,
resulting in the creation of new antigenic molecules, or between food and antigens
(Lerner and Matthias 2015). Moreover, people who have a genetic predisposition
may experience the onset and progression of autoimmune diseases (ADs) due to
leaky gut conditions.

Besides increasing inflammation, a leaky gut has an additional effect related to
the risk of inadequate absorption of crucial macronutrients and micronutrients. This
is significant because deficiencies in vitamins, such as vitamin D, which have been
linked to an increased risk of developing some autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (Gioia et al. 2020). ***3.2 Effects of Western Diet on Obesity***

Increased fat content in the Western diet is associated with the development of obesity, leading to white adipose tissue accumulation and systemic inflammation (Luo
et al. 2016). In addition to being a tissue used to store energy, white adipose tissue
also releases adipokines, which are distinct pro-inflammatory mediators like TNF-­
α, IL-6, and C-reactive protein. It has been reported that these adipokines contribute
to obesity-related chronic inflammation (Conde et al. 2011) which disrupts The

247


immunity system’s capacity to function properly (Haneishi et al. 2023). The high
consumption of saturated fats found in WD is reported to influence the innate
immune system by means of toll-like receptor activation, which subsequently trigger pro-inflammatory signaling pathways (Li et al. 2020).

Western diet not just affects T lymphocyte differentiation, but it also affects how
T cells operate.. High Saturated fat intake by T cells and added sugars, common in
Western diets, has been shown to impair T cell responsiveness and cytokine production. Studies have indicated that obesity can lead to exhaustion of adipose tissue T
cells (Porsche et al. 2021). Additionally, excess fructose consumption, prevalent in
Western diets due to the widespread has been linked to T cell dysfunction, impairing
their ability to respond to pathogens and regulate inflammation (Ma et al. 2022).

In mouse models of Multiple Sclerosis, high infiltration of T cells as well as
macrophages was observed as a result of the effect of high-fat diets on the body’s
adaptive immune system, which was correlated with the deterioration in the clinical
parameters (Mazzucca et al. 2021). Diet-induced obesity has been observed to exacerbate various autoimmune disease models, including inflammatory bowel disease
(Manzel et al. 2014). Furthermore, Leptin, an adipose-derived hormone, was
reported to stimulate T-cell proliferation and promote TH1 responses (Kiernan et al.
2023). Fasting has been observed to decrease circulating leptin levels and improve
the severity of autoimmune conditions (Javanbakht et al. 2023).
###### ***3.3 Effects of Western Diet on Sodium Intake and TH17 Cells***

The Western diet involves the consumption of high amounts of processed foods as
well as fast food which contain high salt content. Salt intake through this type of
diet can contain over 100 times more sodium in comparison to homemade meals.
Les effets d’une consommation excessive de sel on autoimmune diseases was

reported (Jobin et al. 2021). Studies have shown that a high-sodium diet, commonly
found in the Western diet, can influence the immune system and promote the differentiation of TH17 cells. TH17 cells are a subgroup of the T helper cells that play
a significant role in the immune response, particularly in the defense against certain
infections and autoimmune disorders (Jobin et al. 2021; Kleinewietfeld et al. 2013).
However, an increased activation or dysregulation of the TH17 cells can play a role
in chronic inflammation and pathologies autoimmunes (Milovanovic et al. 2020;
Guo 2016). Excessive sodium intake has been found to produce more of interleukin­17, which is a pro-inflammatory cytokine formed by the TH17 cells. IL-17 is known
to play a role in the pathogenesis as well as the progression of arthrose (RA)
(Salgado et al. 2015), several sclerosis (MS) (Cortese et al. 2017), and inflammatory
bowel disease. The increased production of IL-17 driven by a high-sodium Western
diet can contribute to the emergence of these conditions or their worsening (Manzel
et al. 2014).

Furthermore, the Western diet’s impact on the gut microbiota may also influence
TH17 cell differentiation. The gut microbiota regulates significantly the immune

system which affects the overall health. It has been observed that a high-sodium diet
can disrupts the gut microbiome, resulting in changes to the microbial communities
and this potentially affects the immune cell function, including TH17 cells.

Reducing sodium intake and adopting a more balanced and wholesome diet can
help mitigate the adverse effects of the Western diet on TH17 cell activation and
chronic inflammation. Emphasizing whole foods, such as lean proteins, fruits,
whole grains as well as vegetables can provide sufficient nutrients without increased
sodium consumption. Additionally, incorporating probiotic-rich foods and prebiotic
fibers can support healthy gut microbiota and promote immune system balance
(Richards et al. 2016).

In conclusion, the high sodium content of the Western diet may activate and
dysregulate TH17 cells, which may result in autoimmune disorders and chronic
inflammation. Reducing sodium intake and emphasizing whole foods in your diet
can help mitigate these effects and support the immune system’s overall balance and
wellbeing.
###### **4 Inflammatory Autoimmune Diseases and Nutrition** ***4.1 Rheumatoid Arthritis and Nutrition***

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a disease, where hands, wrists, and knees joints are
attacked by the individual’s immune system, and this causes inflammation of the
joint lining causing joint tissue damage. On account of the resulting damage, chronic
pain, imbalance, and joint deformity ensue. Sometimes, in addition to joints, other
tissues may also be impacted, including the eyes and lungs. X-rays, MRIs, ultrasounds, and blood tests can all be used to diagnose RA. Treatments for RA-related
pain and other symptoms are currently available (Radu and Bungau 2021).

Management of RA can be performed by either using modern medicine like
medication and surgical intervention or by utilizing an alternative medicine, and
nutrient management. The commonest medication given for RA to reduce symptoms is called DMARD (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs). Biological
response modifiers are the second-in-line treatment option.

In cases where the DMARD alone cannot alleviate the symptoms of RA, biological drugs such as abatacept, adalimumab, etanercept, tofacitinib, upadacitinib, and
tocilizumab are prescribed along with DMARD. Glucocorticoids and nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are also used to treat RA symptoms. Self-­
management strategies are highly recommended including physical activity, weight
loss, and protecting joints by limiting repetitive joint actions (Sepriano et al. 2020;
Shams et al. 2021).

It is reported that the combination of DMARD with biological treatments has
shown side effects including infections like Herpes Zoster, increased probability of
malignant effects along with a higher chance of developing venous

thromboembolism. Some other side effects are also reported including gastrointestinal perforations, nasopharyngitis, and headaches (Sepriano et al. 2023).

The research findings indicate that a significant portion of individuals with RA
have experimented with herbal remedies, including thyme, chamomile, borage, lavender, ginger, and cinnamon, to alleviate symptoms. These natural herbs have been
noted for their potential anti-inflammatory properties (Fazeli et al. 2021). Moreover,
Curcumin supplementation when used in doses ranging between 250–1500 mg for
8–12 weeks has been reported to induce a decrease in both Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C Reactive Protein (CRP) in rheumatoid arthritis patients aged
18 and up arthritis and ulcerative colitis (Ebrahimzadeh et al. 2021). The underlying
mechanism of action includes suppression of the pro-inflammatory signaling pathways and induction of the activation of the intracellular antioxidant defense system
(Chandran and Goel 2012; Jacob et al. 2019). Furthermore, Curcumin has an antioxidant effect and acts on fibroblast-like synoviocytes by inhibiting Tumor Necrosis
Factor- α (TNF- α) and proinflammatory pathways. These effects have improved the
inflammation-associated symptoms in RA patients (Kloesch et al. 2013). It has been
demonstrated that several other spices, like cinnamon and ginger, reduce the Disease
Activity Score. (DAS28) in RA patients thus reducing the inflammatory symptoms
(Aryaeian et al. 2019; Letarouilly et al. 2020; Shishehbor et al. 2018). In contrast,
extensive research has been conducted on the impact of vitamin D supplements on
individuals with RA. Vitamin D plays an important function in calcium and phosphate metabolism, contributing to the maintenance of bone mass through the regulation of calcium absorption from the gastrointestinal system (Holick and M. 2011).
Its synthesis occurs in the skin through the action of ultraviolet rays, and it exhibits
immunomodulatory effects (Bikle 2011). It has been reported that the deficiency of
vitamin D can be an underlying factor in various autoimmune disorders (Merlino
et al. 2004; Song et al. 2012). The mechanism by which vitamin D improves RA
symptoms is reported to be by inhibiting the proinflammatory T helper type 1 profile and suppressing proliferation and immunoglobulin production (Correale et al.
2009). It has been also observed that vitamin D can suppress the differentiation of
precursor B cells to plasma cells (Chen et al. 2007). Higgins et al. also stated that
vitamin D affected the innate as well as the adaptive immune systems through differentiation of T-cells (Higgins et al. 2013). It has been also reported that vitamin D
receptor agonist can suppress collagen-induced arthritis. Hence, Vitamin D supplementation induces immune tolerance, and since RA patients are subjected to osteoporosis, vitamin D helps in maintaining bone mass (Higgins et al. 2013). Vitamin D
deficiency has been reported to be common between RA patients and this deficiency
may be part of corticosteroids side effects. Corticosteroids are given to RA patients
to reduce pain and inflammation. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants have
been reported to reduce calcium absorption as well as altering vitamin D metabolism (Adorini 2005). Hence supplementing Vitamin D in RA indirectly reduces
inflammation, minimizes pain, strengthens bone disabilities, and improves the quality of life.

###### ***4.2 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Nutrition***


L. M. Annamma et al.


Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an auto-inflammatory disease affecting
both the innate and the adaptive human immune systems. It can affect various body
parts including joints, skin, brain, kidneys, lungs, as well as blood vessels. It is more
common in females and the disease can be very debilitating, causing significant
psychological distress, and scarring (Aparicio-Soto et al. 2017). SLE can cause
damage to multiple organs in the body due to circulating antibodies which leads to
chronic inflammation together with cardiovascular diseases (Schoenfeld et al.
2013), metabolic syndrome, thyroid diseases (Gergianaki et al. 2021) and cancer
(Noble et al. 2016). Diagnosis of SLE is performed through the performance of
confirmatory tests for antibodies against nuclear proteins (DNA & RNA). SLE
treatment includes antimalarials, biologic therapies, synthetic DMARDs, corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, thalidomide, laser and other topical applications such as calcineurin inhibitors, sunscreens, and salbutamol creams.
Hydroxychloroquine is reported to be used as the first line of the treatment (Mok
et al. 2021).

Unwanted side effects are commonly observed with the current anti-­inflammatory
treatments used to manage SLE. The SLE medications when used over long periods
can cause adverse effects such as osteoporosis and organ damage in the case of
glucocorticoids (Ruiz-Irastorza et al. 2012; Abdelrahman et al. 2023) hence alternative medications are being a resort for the patients to avoid the side effects of modern medications. Dietary management is safe and effective along with conventional
treatment, evidence of effects on SLE as such is not clear. The literature has reported
many supplements such as vitamins, omega-3, fish oil, and curcumin to be beneficial in improving the symptoms associated with SLE (de Medeiros et al. 2019;
Islam et al. 2020). Omega-3 has been proven to reduce the parameters including
Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), C-reactive protein, and various inflammatory markers, and oxidative stress as well as improve lipid levels and glycemic index
(Jiao et al. 2022). The mechanism of action of omega-3 in alleviating the symptoms
of SLE has been reported to be through the reduction of inflammation by regulating
the inflammatory mediators. SLE patients are reported to have altered lipid profiles
which can cause cardiovascular complications. Studies have demonstrated the beneficial impact of omega-3 fatty acids on vascular tone, attributed to their ability to
decrease oxidative stress (Duarte-Garcia et al. 2020). Another nutrient that has been
reported to decrease inflammation is curcumin. It is the main active constituent
found in turmeric and it has been recognized for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In patients of SLE with a renal involvement, a study reported that
supplementation with curcumin led to a decrease in proteinuria, hematuria, and systolic blood pressure. This suggests that curcumin can have beneficial effects in managing renal manifestations of SLE (Jiao et al. 2022). Moreover, a study reported by
Momtazi et al. demonstrated that curcumin possesses anti-inflammatory properties
by modulating the inflammatory pathways in the body. These findings highlighted
the potential of curcumin as a therapeutic agent in reducing inflammation associated
with SLE (Momtazi-Borojeni et al. 2018).

251


Additionally, vitamins D, C, A, E, and B have been observed to be of a great
value to SLE patients within the recommended dosage as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy. Vitamin D supplementation was reported to reduce inflammatory characteristics of SLE by action on inflammatory markers (Jiao et al. 2022). Vitamin D has
been reported to reduce apoptosis and modify the cell cycle progression in SLE
(Zou et al. 2023). Vitamin D deficiency has been reported in SLE patients due to
avoidance of sunlight, renal failure, and also because of the effects of glucocorticoids (Correa-Rodríguez et al. 2021). Thus, vitamin D supplements are given to
SLE patients to avoid as well as treat its deficiency Studies have indicated a noteworthy impact of vitamin D supplements on the management of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) by suppressing inflammatory damage and
preventing adverse bone events during the treatment of SLE with medications (Ao
et al. 2021). In regards to vitamin E, it has been reported for its beneficial effect on
SLE patients, where vitamin E supplements have antioxidant properties that can
regulate antibody production and improve the symptoms of SLE (Constantin et al.
2019). Moreover, Vitamin C has been reported to be essential in the management of
SLE as it reduces oxidative stress as well as decreases inflammation and lowers the
Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels. This can in turn prevent cardiovascular
complications associated with SLE. The approved dose for vitamin C indicated for
SLE patients is 500 mg along with vitamin E 800 IU supplement (Klack et al. 2012).
Hence a high dietary regimen containing all the above natural components like in
the Mediterranean diet is preferred over supplements unless prescribed by the physician for SLE as many supplements can interact with medications.
###### ***4.3 Psoriasis and Nutrition***

The autoimmune skin condition psoriasis is typified by the excessive growth of
keratinocytes due to an overactive immune system. It presents as raised, well-­
defined red plaques with irregular borders and silvery scales, primarily affecting
areas like the knees, elbows, trunk, and scalp. The condition, initially defined as a
distinct entity by Ferdinand von Hebra in 1841 and is known by various names such
as Psoriasis Vulgaris, guttate psoriasis and erythrodermic psoriasis (Al-Shobaili and
Qureshi 2013).
Understanding the complex interactions between different cells involved in psoriasis has been a subject of ongoing debate. Recent advancements in cellular immunology, biology, and genetic studies have provided valuable insights into the causes
and treatment of this condition. The disease begins with the activation of T lymphocytes by an unknown antigen or gene product. This activation triggers the release of
various cytokines by T cells, leading to processes such as increased keratinocyte
growth, migration of neutrophils, enhanced immune response, formation of new
blood vessels, and increased cell production in the outermost layer of the skin.
Symptoms and classification of psoriasis vary depending on its type. Various
aspects, including morphological features of elementary lesions, degree of


-----

252


L. M. Annamma et al.


inflammation, distribution pattern, extent, time of onset, and rate of spread, are considered in classifying psoriasis (Tripathi and Bhardwaj 2020).

In the management of psoriasis, there is currently no universally accepted standard of care for patients with moderate to severe symptoms. The choice of systemic
therapy should be carefully considered, weighing the benefits and risks for each
patient (Martin et al. 2019). Phototherapy is often the first line of treatment, especially for those with extensive psoriasis or severe symptoms, however, the most
effective treatment plan is the one that the patient is most likely to adhere to. If
phototherapy is not feasible or ineffective, systemic treatments with oral medications or biologics may be necessary. Psoriasis requires long-term treatment due to
its high prevalence and as it is affecting the quality of life (Arrieta Valero 2019). The
function of nutrients, especially vitamin D, in the onset and treatment of inflammatory autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis has drawn a lot of attention in recent
years. Extensive research has been conducted to investigate the role of vitamin D in
the proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes, the predominant cells in the
epidermis, after it was discovered that these cells have vitamin D receptors. It has
been discovered that vitamin D inhibits keratinocytes’ excessive growth and encourages their appropriate differentiation. As a result, research into the role of vitamin D
in the pathophysiology of psoriasis has been conducted, indicating that elevated
keratinocyte proliferation and cutaneous inflammation may be facilitated by a drop
in vitamin D levels (Pona et al. 2019). Diverse findings from studies examining the
connection between psoriasis and serum vitamin D levels have given rise to a continuing discussion (Marek-Jozefowicz et al. 2022). In 2018, a meta-analysis revealed
a strong correlation between low vitamin D levels and psoriasis; however, the limitations in sample size and study heterogeneity precluded the establishment of causality. There have been mixed results from subsequent case-control studies; some
have found a strong correlation between vitamin D levels and psoriasis, while others
have not found a significant correlation (Stanescu et al. 2021).

A study was carried out to assess serum vitamin D levels in a larger cohort of
psoriasis patients and investigate the relationship between vitamin D levels and disease severity and duration, given the contradictory evidence and the need for a more
thorough understanding of the relationship between vitamin D and psoriasis. This
study attempted to offer important insights into the course of psoriasis patients and
the possible advantages of oral vitamin D supplementation as part of their management, while accounting for potential confounding variables. Research on the function of nutrients, especially vitamin D, in inflammatory autoimmune diseases such
as psoriasis is generally an important field of study. Comprehending the intricate
relationship among vitamin D, immune responses, and the etiology of psoriasis may
facilitate the development of more effective therapeutic approaches and enhanced
patient outcomes (Pokharel et al. 2022).

Given that psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is influenced
by a number of factors, such as immune dysregulation and inflammation, it is reasonable to assume that the etiology of psoriasis involves the stimulation of T-helper
(Th-1) and (Th-17) lymphocytes, which results in an increase in the production of
inflammatory cytokines. Certain dietary components have an impact on the

inflammatory response, and nutrition plays a role in modulating inflammation
(Miyagawa et al. 2022).

Lipids, especially saturated fats like those in butter and red meat, can raise interleukins’ concentration and aid in the development of inflammation (Saghafi-Asl
et al. 2021). Overconsumption of the n-6 family of unsaturated fatty acids, which is
present in refined vegetable oils and margarine, can also contribute to inflammation.
On the other hand, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) from
nuts, fish, and plant-based oils have anti-inflammatory qualities and are beneficial to
health (Mattavelli et al. 2021).

Simple sugars in the diet, when consumed excessively, may exacerbate inflammation in psoriasis. Lowering the glycemic index (GI) has been associated with
reduced inflammation. Some studies suggest that dietary interventions, including
low-carbohydrate diets and polyphenol supplementation, may improve the condition of psoriasis patients, although results have been conflicting (Fu et al. 2021).
Compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties are essential for psoriasis sufferers’ diet. These consist of substances like dietary fibers, polyphenols,
omega-3 acids, and vitamins A, E, and C. They also include trace minerals like
copper, manganese, zinc, and selenium. Probiotics, fruits, vegetables, vitamin D,
fish oil, and vitamin E have all been shown to help psoriasis sufferers’ condition
(Pokharel et al. 2022).

Additionally, inflammatory skin diseases are significantly influenced by the gut
microbiota (Polkowska-Pruszyńska et al. 2020). For those with psoriasis, probiotics
and prebiotics are advised as vital components of a well-balanced diet. Psoriasis can
be made worse by dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, but complex carbohydrates,
which are present in fruits and vegetables, have been shown to reduce inflammation
(Gioia et al. 2020).

Certain food ingredients, such as cyclitols, genistein, and selenium, have shown
the potential in inhibiting psoriasis development. Cyclitols have immunomodulatory effects, while genistein, found in soybeans, may reduce inflammation, and
inhibit disease progression. Selenium, as a trace element, contributes to the cellular
antioxidant defense system and serves to inhibit. Inflammation-related pathways
(Fu et al. 2021).

Psoriasis sufferers need to be aware of dietary triggers, which include processed
foods, nightshade vegetables, gluten, dairy products, and white sugar (Garbicz et al.
2022). These substances have the capacity to upset the immune system, irritate the
gut epithelium, and disrupt the gut microbiome. Antioxidants and high-fiber complex carbohydrates from fruits and vegetables, on the other hand, have been shown
to have an inverse relationship with inflammatory markers. All things considered,
diet affects how inflammation is modulated in psoriasis. It has been suggested that
managing the illness and enhancing general health can be accomplished with a balanced diet that excludes dietary triggers and contains anti-inflammatory and antioxidant components (Kanda et al. 2020).

The inflammatory and itchy skin condition known as psoriasis can be supported
by a variety of diets and nutritional regimens. Numerous studies have demonstrated
the benefits of various diets in controlling the symptoms of psoriasis. Diets

emphasizing lower energy intake, vegetarian diets, and weight loss programs incorporating dietary modifications are among the diets that are helpful for psoriasis
patients. These diets are usually high in fruits and vegetables, which provide you
plenty of essential vitamins, minerals, and other beneficial substances with less
calories (Duchnik et al. 2023). Particularly the Mediterranean diet has been linked
to improvements in inflammatory conditions like psoriasis (Wu and Weinberg
2019). This diet lowers animal fats and simple carbs while increasing fresh fruits
and vegetables, olive oil, legumes, and seeds. It is thought that the polyphenols and
antioxidants present in Mediterranean diets have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant
qualities. This diet’s monounsaturated fatty acids also have other health benefits,
like lowering the risk of osteoporosis, altering immunological and inflammatory
responses, and lowering the risk of cancer and heart disease. The Mediterranean
diet‘s signature nutrients—beta-carotenoids, polyphenols, folic acid, and fiber—are
essential for preventing oxidative stress (Guasch-Ferré and Willett 2021). Certain
components of the Mediterranean diet, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and
seafood, have been related in studies to lower levels of inflammatory markers (Pona
et al. 2019).

An alternative dietary approach for individuals with psoriasis is the ketogenic
diet, which involves reducing carbohydrate intake and increasing protein and fat
consumption. This diet shifts the body to ketone metabolism, using fat as the primary energy source and decreasing glucose levels. Research has indicated that
adopting a low-calorie ketogenic diet can lead to a reduction in pro-inflammatory
cytokines and a decrease in the severity of symptoms associated with psoriasis
(Kanda et al. 2020).
There is q study by Ewa et al. didn’t strongly support the idea of some literature
that suggests the therapeutic role and current reports suggest limited evidence
regarding the effectiveness of a gluten-free diet in managing psoriasis. Elevated
levels of anti-gliadin antibodies in certain psoriasis patients might signal the presence of coexisting celiac disease, warranting a gluten-free diet exclusively for those
with established gluten intolerance (Passali et al. 2020).

Another recommended dietary approach for individuals with psoriasis is a vegetarian diet, comprising legumes, grains, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and mushrooms.
Variations may include the inclusion of dairy products and eggs. Because this diet
excludes meat, it lowers intake of cholesterol and saturated fats, which are important for controlling uric acid levels and preventing cardiovascular diseases (Islam
et al. 2021). It has been noted that eating a vegetarian diet can result in decreased
blood levels of triglycerides and C-reactive protein (CRP), a decreased risk of being
overweight, and a decrease in the production of pro-inflammatory chemicals
(Garbicz et al. 2022; Wu and Weinberg 2019).

In summary, psoriasis is a long-term skin condition marked by keratinocyte
hyperproliferation brought on by an inflammatory response. Numerous types of
psoriasis are linked to the disease, such as erythrodermic psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, guttate psoriasis, inverse psoriasis, psoriasis vulgaris, and palmoplantar

psoriasis.. Various diets, such as low-energy and vegetarian diets, the Mediterranean
diet, and the ketogenic diet, can have positive effects on psoriasis by reducing
inflammation and improving overall health. However, the therapeutic role of a
gluten-­free diet in psoriasis treatment remains uncertain and Should be adopted
exclusively by individuals who have confirmed gluten intolerance (Bruzzese et al.
2020). Recent advancements in cellular immunology, biology, and genetic studies
have provided valuable insights into the causes and treatment of psoriasis, highlighting the complex interactions between different cells. Maintaining a balanced
diet that incorporates anti-inflammatory and antioxidant components while avoiding dietary triggers can help manage psoriasis and enhance overall health (Caso
et al. 2020).
###### ***4.4 Multiple Sclerosis and Nutrition***

Multiple sclerosis is described as an immune-mediated condition affecting the central nervous system. It is marked by persistent inflammation, demyelination, gliosis,
and neuronal damage, which often result in physical or cognitive disabilities and
various neurological impairments (Noyes and Weinstock-Guttman 2013). It is estimated that in 2020 a worldwide population of 2.8 million are affected by MS
(Walton et al. 2020). The symptoms of MS include numbness of limbs, optic neuritis, visual loss, tremor and ataxic gait, double vision, dysarthria, and fatigue.
Increased risk of stroke (Hong et al. 2019) and a decrease in life expectancy (Scalfari
et al. 2013) have also been reported. Multiple sclerosis is linked to conditions such
as disability, fatigue, depression, cognitive challenges, and reduced employment
opportunities (Gil-González et al. 2020), hence suicide tendencies (Fredrikson et al.
2003) are more in MS patients.

Common medications used for MS as the first line are baclofen, tizanidine, and
gabapentin. Other medications such as diazepam and Nabiximols, and intrathecal
phenols are used as add-on therapy along with the first-line treatment to reduce
symptoms associated with MS (Otero-Romero et al. 2016). The medications given
to patients with MS do not cure the disease but only relieve the associated symptoms, hence many alternative therapies have been reported (Cavalli et al. 2019). It
has been reported that the reasons for resorting to the alternative treatment options
is dare to reduced long-term efficacy and lack of access to immunomodulators such
as interferon-b and glatiramer acetate. The commonest alternative option was
Oenothera seed oil and vitamin supplements (Fryze et al. 2006).

The commonest vitamin supplement in MS is Vitamin D which is observed to
improve the quality of life in MS patients (Niino and Miyazaki 2017). The mechanism of action of Vitamin D on antiinflammation is its regulatory action on lymphocyte and cell proliferation (Piec et al. 2021). It has been reported that no significant
benefit in Vitamin D supplements on the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) on

which MS patients are assessed (Doosti-Irani et al. 2019). Though studies relating
to the use of Vitamin D did not directly treat MS they are recommended as supplements due to various reasons. One such reason is that Vitamin D plays a significant
role in mental health. Many studies have observed that MS patients are prone to
depression and suicidal tendencies (Vellekkatt and Menon 2019; Cheng et al. 2020)
Apart from mental health Vitamin D supplement has proved to have health benefits
for patients with various diseases to counter osteoporosis. MS patients have been
reported widely to have Vitamin D deficiency (Amrein et al. 2020; Haines and Park
2012; Feige et al. 2020).

One of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis is neuronal degeneration. Neuronal
degeneration is directly linked to increased oxidative stress leading to mitochondrial
dysfunction and neuronal cell death (Blagov et al. 2022). Diets such as Vitamin D,
fatty acids, and curcumin have been reported to dampen oxidative stress (Stoiloudis
et al. 2022). Antioxidants have been observed to reduce inflammatory factors and
oxidative stresses and prevent chronic demyelination as well as axonal damage
(Theodosis-Nobelos and Rekka 2023). Vitamin A has been reported among the vitamin supplements indicated for MS. Vitamin A is a fat-soluble nutrient that includes
retinoids and carotenoids in diets. Dairy products such as milk, cheese, and oil have
Vitamin A. A dosage of 400 IU/day is recommended for fatigue in MS patients
(Bitarafan et al. 2016). Another dietary supplement that has proved to have benefits
in the quality of life for MS is Omega-3. Some studies proved Omega 3 to be beneficial (Ovcharova et al. 2022) and some reported otherwise (AlAmmar et al. 2021).

Marine n-3 PUFAs have been recently reported to improve the quality of life in
patients diagnosed with MS. The mechanism of action includes its antioxidant, anti-­
inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties by suppressing inflammatory transcription factors, reducing oxidative stresses, and blocking proinflammatory
interleukins (La Rosa et al. 2023). They also possess protective action against nerve
demyelination (Bagur et al. 2017). Amongst the polyunsaturated fatty acids,
α-linolenic acid (ALA) when consumed is reported to have reduced chances of MS
(AlAmmar et al. 2021). Omega 3 fatty acids enriched fish oil was observed by
Riccio et al. To reduce inflammation and oxidative stress (Moles and Otaegui 2020).

Both pre and probiotics have been reported for their effects in the reduction of
MS symptoms. Prebiotics consist of living microorganisms that benefit the host
microbiota. Dairy products are a rich source of prebiotics such as Lactobacillus in
curds (Lombardi et al. 2018; Jiang et al. 2021). Pre and probiotic supplements help
in the reduction of inflammatory markers and balance the gut microbiota in MS
(Kouchaki et al. 2017). The Commonest Dietary regiments containing the recommended supplements for MS include the Mediterranean diet (Katz Sand et al. 2023),
Paleolithic diet (Wahls et al. 2019), Ketogenic diet (Lin et al. 2022), McDougall
Diet (Evans et al. 2019), restricted carbohydrate diet (Fanara et al. 2021), Swank
diet (Shemirani et al. 2023) as well as the MIND diet (Noormohammadi et al. 2022)
and DASH diet (Rotstein et al. 2019).

9 Nutraceuticals in Inflammatory Autoimmune Diseases
###### ***4.5 Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis (HT) and Nutrition***


257


Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) is an autoimmune condition characterized by infiltration of lymphocytes, causing the damage of the thyroid gland. The primary cause of
this disease is an elevated level of antibodies against thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin. As a result, HT patients experience various physical and psychological
symptoms due to alterations in thyroid hormone levels and metabolism. The severity of symptoms is often associated with higher levels of antibodies targeting thyroid antigens. Environmental factors are required to initiate the immune system’s
attack on the thyroid gland, even though genetic factors are a major contributing
factor to the development of hypothyroidism (HT). Stress, exposure to toxins, an
imbalance in gut flora, and insufficient nutrition are a few examples of these factors
(Ralli et al. 2020).

The role of diet intervention a crucial role in Hashimoto’s treatment. The objective is to consume an anti-inflammatory diet in order to give the body the right
nutrients and control the immune system. Studies have indicated that HT patients
frequently experience nutritional deficits. The significance of potassium, selenium,
copper, iodine, magnesium, zinc, and vitamins A, D, C, and B in the diet of HT
patients has been shown in a number of studies. Furthermore, it has been recommended to consume dietary fiber, keep your protein intake at a suitable level, and
include unsaturated fatty acids—especially those in the omega-3 family (Ihnatowicz
et al. 2020).

It is recommended that HT patients avoid lactose from their diet due to lactose
intolerance and potential interactions with levothyroxine, a medication commonly
used to manage the condition. Furthermore, gluten elimination is recommended due
to potential interactions between gliadin (a component of gluten) and thyroid antigens. This article provides an overview of the nutritional factors relevant to HT
patients and offers dietary recommendations for managing the condition (Asik
et al. 2014).

However, it’s still not clear which strategy of diet would be the best, as diet can
be a complementary treatment for Hashimoto’s disease possibly by affecting thyroid function and anti-inflammatory properties (Osowiecka and Myszkowska-­
Ryciak 2023). Excessive and prolonged consumption of iodine can result in
autoimmune thyroiditis due to the triggering of a strong immune response thyroglobulin (Tg), which has been highly iodinated. Similar results may be obtained
from the recently implemented universal salt iodization program. Although it is
temporary (Mikulska et al. 2022). Conversely, selenium proteins are essential for
thyroid function; in particular, they shield the thyroid by removing excess hydrogen
peroxide generated during Tg iodination. Genetic data indicates that a higher risk of
autoimmune thyroiditis is associated with the anti-inflammatory selenoprotein S
(Hu and Rayman 2017). Selenium and selenoproteins have been shown to lower
thyroid peroxidase (TPO)-antibody levels and the incidence of hypothyroidism and
postpartum thyroiditis, according to observational studies and randomized

controlled trials. A low iron intake is linked to impaired thyroid metabolism
(Rayman 2019). Heme, an iron-containing molecule, is necessary for TPO, the
enzyme that produces thyroid hormone, to become active on the surface of thyrocytes. People with autoimmune thyroiditis frequently have iron deficiency because
autoimmune gastritis, which impairs iron absorption, is a common comorbidity.
Iron therapy raises thyroid hormone levels in anemic women with impaired thyroid
function, but thyroxine plus iron works better to improve iron status. Vitamin D
levels have been found to be lower in HT patients (those with autoimmune thyroiditis) than in healthy individuals. Additionally, there have been reports of an inverse
relationship between TPO/Tg antibodies and serum vitamin D levels. Nevertheless,
additional information and the absence of trial evidence point to the possibility that
autoimmune disease processes involving vitamin D receptor dysfunction are more
likely to be the cause of low vitamin D status. In order to address any deficiency,
clinicians are advised to check their patients’ iron levels and inquire about the menstrual cycle and vitamin D status in female patients. It is imperative to ensure adequate consumption of selenium in areas where iodine levels are either excessive or
inadequate. When the body doesn’t get enough selenium from food, it could be a
good idea to take a 50–100 μg daily supplement (Hu and Rayman 2017).

Indeed, vitamin D supplementation can help HT patients experience less disease
activity; however, more large-scale, carefully monitored studies are required to
determine whether or not this treatment can be implemented in clinical settings
(Chahardoli et al. 2019). When levothyroxine is being used to treat Hashimoto’s
thyroiditis in women with normal vitamin D levels, vitamin D preparations have
been shown to reduce thyroid autoimmunity (Krysiak et al. 2017).
###### ***4.6 Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and Nutrition***

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammation of the Gastrointestinal
tract with an excess of immune response to normal gut flora and is grouped with
Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. It (Santacroce et al. 2021). Chronic inflammation causes cytokines, chemokines, eicosanoids, and other inflammatory mediators as nitric oxide to cause tissue destruction (Vezza et al. 2016). The current
medications used to treat IBD cause systemic immunosuppression and cannot be
used for a longer duration. The most common medications used are steroids such as
prednisone which can cause side effects such as elevated blood sugar and osteoporosis. The other medications are 5-aminosalicylates, and immunomodulators such
as Azathioprine, 6-Mercaptopurine, and Methotrexate. They reduce the activity of
cells causing inflammation of GIT. They have adverse effects such as liver and pancreas inflammation. They are suggested to be still safer than steroids. The other
group of medications used are biologics which block the effect of tumor necrosis
factor-alpha thereby decreasing cell activity and inflammation. Examples are

infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab pegol. They have adverse effects reported
as lymphoma. There is another group that blocks the ability of white blood cells to
cause inflammation as Natalizumab. Adverse effects have been reported as a rare
chance of developing progressive multifocal encephalopathy (Triantafillidis et al.
2011). The serious adverse effects of these medications have led to the search for
alternative medicine as a treatment option. In 1800 a substance salicin was extracted
from willow trees and used for RA. The present-day acetylsalicylic acid was refined
from the salicin preparation (Mahdi et al. 2006). Herbs has been haveorted to possess anti-inflammatory properties and were used in traditional Chinese medicine
with a successful reduction in inflammation (Wang et al. 2023). Probiotics are the
most frequently used alternative therapy for inflammatory bowel disease. The gut
microbiota has been studied in individuals suffering from Crohn’s disease and it
was observed that there is an increase in levels of aerobic and facultative anaerobes
which are prone to invade the gut epithelium leading to inflammation. Crohn’s
patients also showed a decrease in the beneficial obligate anaerobes (Liu et al.
2021). Probiotic therapy alters intestinal pH, competes for nutrients, and produces
antimicrobial compounds decreasing the bacteria causing inflammation thereby
reducing the symptoms (Coqueiro et al. 2019). In dietary regulation, anti-­
inflammatory foods such as low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides,
monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) are recommended. The FODMAPs
consist of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and gluten-free oats and rice. This dietary regulation needs to be done under the supervision of a dietician or treating doctor. A low-­
fat diet is also recommended in inflammatory bowel disease patients (Jorgensen and
Santer 2023; Boradyn et al. 2021). The specific carbohydrate diet used is reported
to be effective in ulcerative colitis. The mechanism of action is only the consumption of monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, and galactose). It was observed from
the evidence that di and polysaccharides go undigested into the colon producing
bacterial and yeast growth with excessive mucous that can damage the gastrointestinal mucosa. This diet includes fruits, vegetables, honey, lentils, split peas, and
lactose-free dairy products (Walsh et al. 2020). Another diet plan is the Palaeolithic
diet. This consists of lean meat and plant-based food up to 100 gm daily. The limitation is that it can lead to vitamin D deficiency (Bland 2021). Another dietary regimen that was reported by Olendzki et al. was an anti-inflammatory diet which is
based on dysbiosis theory. This diet limits all refined sugars and gluten-based diets
that cause inflammatory bacteria in the gut. The diet consists of fibrous food such as
leek and onion, fermented food, and food sources rich in Omega-3 fatty acids
(Agrawal et al. 2020). It was reported also that the elimination of the inflammatory
substances from diet regimens has improved both symptoms associated with IBD as
well as endoscopic inflammation which is known as Autoimmune Protocol Diet
(AIP) (Konijeti et al. 2017).

###### **5 Summary of Diet Regimens for Inflammatory ** **Autoimmune Diseases**


L. M. Annamma et al.


An anti-inflammatory agent is defined as any substance that reduces inflammation
symptoms. Inflammation can be acute, characterized by sudden flare-ups of inflammatory symptoms, or chronic, lasting for months or even years. Anti-inflammatory
substances can be natural or synthetic in nature. This chapter focuses on natural
anti-inflammatory substances and diet regimens that have been proven to alleviate
most of the symptoms of inflammatory autoimmune diseases. By incorporating a
diet rich in anti-inflammatory agents, patients with autoimmune diseases such as
rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus and inflammatory bowel disease can experience an improved quality of life. These diet plans,
such as the Mitterrandian diet, have shown effectiveness in reducing symptoms such
as inflammation, swelling, tenderness, pain, and fatigue. They are rich in food substances such as flavonoids, polyphenols, fibers, herbs, vitamins, and other anti-­
inflammatory compounds.

Among the commonly used herbs and spices, turmeric stands out for its high
content of polyphenol curcumin, which is widely recommended for all types of
inflammation. Garlic contains diallyl disulfide, cinnamon contains cinnamaldehyde
and cinnamic acid, and cardamom has been shown to block inflammatory pathways.
Ginger is known for its ability to suppress leukotrienes, while thyme, an herb rich in
antioxidants, also exhibits anti-inflammatory properties. Green tea, which contains
epigallocatechin-3-gallate, caffeine, and chlorogenic acid, has been beneficial in
reducing inflammatory symptoms. Pepper, specifically piperine, possesses antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties. Cayenne, found in chili peppers, is also known for its anti-inflammatory action, according to the Arthritis
Foundation. Other herbs and plants, such as willow bark, borage seed oil, and thunder god vine (used in traditional Chinese medicine), have been used to reduce
inflammation. However, caution must be exercised as some of these substances can
interfere with other medications and may not be suitable for individuals with specific medical conditions.

Seafood is another category of food that contains anti-inflammatory substances,
particularly omega-3 fatty acids. Fatty fish like mackerel, bluefin tuna, sardines, anchovies, cod, and whitefish are rich sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Green-lipped mussels
and oysters also provide substantial amounts of these beneficial fatty acids. Omega-3
fatty acids in seafood are most effective when the fish is baked, grilled, or steamed.

Fruits and vegetables are a third category of food that contains anti-inflammatory
substances, mainly antioxidants. Tomatoes, for example, contain the antioxidant
lycopene, while kale and spinach are rich in vitamin K. Broccoli contains phenolics
and sulforaphane, and various berries are abundant in flavonols. Fruits with purple
skin, such as grapes, berries, and plums, as well as red wine, peanuts, and dark
chocolate, contain resveratrol, another powerful antioxidant. Pineapple contains
bromelain, an enzyme known for its anti-inflammatory effects. Consuming these
fruits and vegetables in their raw form provides the greatest benefit.

Nuts and seeds make up the fourth category and are good sources of PUFAs and
vitamin E, both of which possess antioxidant properties. Incorporating these foods
into a balanced diet can help inhibit inflammatory pathways and promote healthy
gut microbiota. Therefore, a balanced diet that is composed of high-fiber, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and legumes is desired to ease symptoms inflammatory autoimmune disorders. This dietary approach should be part of a comprehensive treatment
regimen that also includes medications, physical activity, stress control, and avoidance of a Western diet.

Among the various dietary studies conducted, vegetarian diets consisting of
whole grains, vegetables, legumes, fruits, and nuts have been shown to reduce
inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein when followed for extended periods. The Mediterranean diet is another widely recommended approach for autoimmune disorders. This diet includes whole grains, fish, olive oil, nuts, vegetables, and
fruits and is commonly consumed in Greece and Southern Italy. The MIND diet, a
variation of the Mediterranean as well as DASH diets, has been recognized as the
best diet by experts in a study of 39 diets conducted by US News and World Report
in 2021. The DASH diet, originally developed to tackle blood pressure, cholesterol,
and heart diseases, emphasizes vitamin and mineral-rich foods, low-fat and low-­
sodium options, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean meats, proteins, fish, fat-free
or low-fat dairy products, herbal seasonings instead of salt, and limited consumption of processed foods. The Mediterranean diet includes vegetables, fruits, whole
grains, berries, olive oil, beans, nuts, and fish. The MIND diet combines elements of
both the DASH and Mediterranean diets and has shown significant effectiveness in
reducing inflammatory symptoms in autoimmune disorders.

Another diet plan that is gaining attention is the macrobiotic diet. In addition to
grains, vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, and legumes, this diet allows for the consumption of seasoned foods, soups, fermented foods, and natural sweeteners, along with
mild beverages. The macrobiotic diet is relatively easier to follow as a lifestyle, with
equal portions of 25% for grains, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds. Other popular
diet plans include vegan diets, ketogenic diets, low-carbohydrate diets, intermittent
fasting, raw food diets, and paleo diets. However, it is important to note that these
regimens are primarily focused on weight loss rather than specifically targeting
inflammation.

The Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) diet is another recommended diet plan for individuals with autoimmune disorders. This diet involves the elimination of all foods
known to cause inflammation, followed by a gradual reintroduction of foods once
symptoms improve. The AIP diet consists of two phases: the elimination and reintroduction phase. During the elimination phase, foods such as grains, nuts, seeds,
dairy products, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, processed foods, oils, and
certain spices are avoided. The effects of nutritional consideration to different
inflammatory autoimmune diseases is provided in Table 9.1 and Fig. 9.1.

###### **1 Introduction**

Infertility is a disease affecting the reproductive system of both sexes defined as the
inability to conceive after 1 year or more without barrier contraception or 6 months
for women over 35 years old. The World Health Organization has also reported that
one in six adults experience infertility (World Health Organization (WHO) 2023). It
is a prevalent health condition that is getting higher over the time and affecting millions of couples worldwide, reaching around 15–17.5% of pairs (Boivin et al. 2007;
Mascarenhas et al. 2012; World Health Organization (WHO) 2023). However, this
prevalence of infertility varies among different populations, with a wider range
from 10% to 17.5% globally, and observing greater prevalence amounts in African,
European countries, Western Pacific and The Americas (Cox et al. 2022; World
Health Organization (WHO) 2023). There are not enough studies focusing on gender, but female infertility seems to be more common than male infertility,

accounting for approximately 40% to 50% of all cases, although more studies are
focused on males. Moreover, the current lifestyle leads to seek pregnancy at older
ages, observing that the highest prevalence of infertility appears in the 35–39 age
groups (Cox et al. 2022), In addition, different researchers have used modified definitions of infertility or different study designs to assess this inability to conceive so
the results obtained may differ and may not be comparable (Fig. 10.1). For instance,
the time-to-pregnancy (TTP), considered the gold standard, is defined as the menstrual cycles or months that elapse until pregnancy (Baird et al. 1986; Joffe 1989),
but it could differ depending on several factors, for instance the contraceptive methods or the frequency of sexual activity (Olsen et al. 1998; Weinberg et al. 1994).
Another example is related to primary and secondary infertility which are not
always described, taking into account that primary infertility denotes to the inability
of an individual to attain pregnancy, whereas secondary infertility is characterized
by the situation where one prior pregnancy or more has been reached before (World
Health Organization (WHO) 2023).

Infertility can have significant psychological and emotional impacts on individuals and couples, including depression, anxiety, and social isolation (Gdanska et al.
2017). Therefore, efforts in identifying risk factors that can be modified, such as
diet, would be crucial in the prevention and management of this inability.

###### **2 Infertility in the Society**


273


Around 15% of couples attempting to achieve pregnancy face fertility problems
(Tamrakar and Bastakoti 2019) and a signal of this issue is the number of couples
that ask for assisted reproductive technologies (de Geyter et al. 2020). The causes of
infertility in couples can be both male and female **,** with combined factors being
identified in around 40% of cases (Tamrakar and Bastakoti 2019). Infertility can
result from several medical conditions, such as ovulatory disorders, tubal factor
infertility, endometriosis, and uterine factors in females (Practice Committee of the
American Society for Reproductive Medicine 2015; Tamrakar and Bastakoti 2019),
and abnormal semen parameters, testicular disorders, obstructive azoospermia, and
hormonal imbalances in males (Tamrakar and Bastakoti 2019; Winters and Walsh
2014). However, infertility could also be a combined problem of both female and
male abnormalities.

In addition, there are risk factors for infertility that include age, obesity, smoking, alcohol consumption, exposure to toxins in the environment, and lifestyle factors including diet, exercise, and pressure in couples. In fact, last years, there has
been growing attention in the impact of diet in the development of infertility. A
number of studies have suggested that dietary factors, such as high consumption of
red meat, trans fats, and processed foods, could rise the risk of infertility, while a
healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins may improve
fertility (Afeiche et al. 2014; Çekici and Akdevelioğlu 2019; Gaskins and Chavarro
2018; Salas-Huetos et al. 2017) For instance, a higher chance of achieving pregnancy through *in vitro* fertilization (IVF), with a 40% increased chance of successful conception, was described in pairs following a Mediterranean diet (Karayiannis
et al. 2018).

Male infertility has increased last decades, observing changes in sperm quality
and an increase in testicular tumours (Sengupta et al. 2017; World Health
Organization 2021); indeed, male infertility has been associated to a higher risk of
cancer, malignancies, and chronic and cardiovascular diseases (Calogero et al.
2023). Genetics could play a crucial function to detect abnormality in males, currently accounting ~15%, with the Klinefelter or XXY syndrome being the most
common alteration (Bojesen et al. 2003). However, this percentage could be different as new methodologies are arising and many genes are implicated in spermatogenesis (Hotaling and Carrell 2014).

Moreover, infertility in men is also correlated with the role that the reactive oxygen species (ROS) play. For a proper physiological function, ROS are important;
and among these physiological functions are the development of spermatozoa in
sperm and acrosome reaction and sperm-oocyte fusion during fertilisation (Ávila
et al. 2022). However, an excess of ROS, exceeding the ability of seminal fluid to
remove them, results in oxidative stress that initiates an assault on the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) found in the sperm plasma membrane. These can induce
the formation of reactive aldehydes (such as malondialdehyde), that contribute to
mitochondrial dysfunction, triggering additional ROS production and further


-----

disruption of sperm function, such as the acrosome reaction or sperm–oocyte recognition and fusion (Aitken 2020; Takeshima et al. 2020). This could also result in
DNA damage (i.e. 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine as a mutagenic product) (Aitken
and Baker 2020) and fragmentation in the sperm DNA (Agarwal et al. 2020; Cho
and Agarwal 2017) which has been related to abnormality in semen analysis or to
azoospermia (Aitken and Baker 2020).

Although the hormonal effects in men are not fully studied, male infertility can
also be related to hormonal defects or imbalances. Various studies have associated

obesity in men with hormonal changes that ultimately affect fertility. In obese men,
there are alterations of the endocrine system, such as incorrect hormonal secretion,
unusual circulating concentrations of hormones or alterations in their transport.
This is based on the fact that obesity is linked to decreased levels of testosterone,
which leads to alterations in sperm parameters. The hypothalamus-pituitary-testis
axis is affected in men with increased body mass index, due to the blocking of sex
hormone binding globulin because of the effect of elevated insulin concentrations,
resulting in a rise in the concentrations of free androgens which are aromatized in
fatty tissue (Hammoud et al. 2008). Thus, there is an increase in oestrogen levels,
which by negative feedback inhibit the hypothalamic secretion of gonadotropin-­
releasing hormone, and in consequence, the hypothalamus-pituitary-testis axis
decreases testosterone production. In fact, it has been described hypotestosteronaemia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in obesity, which impair fertility
(Pasquali 2006). Varicocele is a disorder in which there is an enlargement of veins
within the scrotum, resulting in impaired blood flow and potential negative effects
on sperm production and fertility. As it is known, temperature is important for testicular physiology. In this sense, varicocele induces an increase in the testes’ temperature, so that reducing the synthesis of testosterone by the Leydig cells and
diminishing the functionality of the Sertoli cells (Khera and Lipshultz 2008). The
alterations in these last cells include low inhibin-B secretion whose role is the inhib
itory feedback in the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) production by the hypophysis, so that a rise of FSH levels in the circulation is also observed in patients with
varicocele (Comhaire and Vermeulen 1975; Pierik et al. 2001).

Male fertility is also affected by other factors, including oncological diseases
whose treatments affect the initial sperm quality and spermatogenesis phase
(Vakalopoulos et al. 2015), inflammation and infections, atrophy or congenital
hypoplastic testes (Ahmed et al. 2010), or other sexual dysfunctions (Lotti and
Maggi 2018). Furthermore, different environmental risk factors can induce deleterious effects over spermatozoa in males and, consequently, infertility arises because
those are exogenous ROS sources. Among the risk issues, it should be cited obesity
together with sedentary patterns (Hammoud et al. 2008; Pasquali 2006), smoking
and alcohol, exposition to radiation, and pollution. In fact, there has been cited a
direct correlation between abnormal semen and smoking and sexually transmitted
diseases (Garba-Alkali et al. 2018).

Smoking cigarettes are usual in reproductive individuals especially in countries
of the First World, being Europe the leader regarding to smoking (Sharma et al.
2016). Both active and passive smoking have been related to infertility (Anderson

et al. 2011). The many chemicals (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals,
mutagenic substances) present in tobacco smoke are responsible for alterations in
hormonal parameters and spermatogenesis, affecting viability and motility, morphology (such as in sperm tail) and concentration of sperm (Künzle et al. 2003;
Sharma et al. 2016). Also, it has been described alterations in oocyte fertilization,
being affected the acrosome reaction and capacitation in smokers (Kumosani et al.
2008; Shrivastava et al. 2014). Smokers presented an increment of inflammatory
protein levels in their seminal plasma (Antoniassi et al. 2016). For this reason,
smoking is related to an inflammatory condition, which can cause the alteration of
the above cited spermatozoid and mitochondrial qualities, integrity of the acrosome,
and the increment of DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, smoker parents affect to the
health of their infants transmitting damaged DNA by oxidative stress. For instance,
in male smokers, it has been related modifications in the methylation of sperm DNA
to alterations in their children (Jenkins et al. 2017). Altogether, tobacco consumption is linked to a significant rise in delay (6 months) in conception in men (Practice
Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine American Society
for Reproductive Medicine 2018). Not only tobacco is related to infertility in men,
but also other consumption such as cannabis. It has been shown that infertile men
who were regular cannabis users presented significantly higher sperm aneuploidy,
total chromosome, and DNA fragmentation than non-cannabis users. So, sperm
nuclear quality and progression of spermatogenesis have been deleteriously affected
by cannabis consumption (Verhaeghe et al. 2020).

Alcohol abuse disorder is a serious condition associated with infertility.
Spermatogenesis and testosterone metabolism are also affected by alcohol consumption, although there is more evidence of chronic and abuse consumption. Not
only alcohol has been related to lesser seminal fluid, the morphology, motility and
concentration of sperm, but also the hormone responses are altered. It has been
found that alcohol caused oxidative stress and it induces a genotoxic effect on the
DNA integrity and regulation of hormones, disturbing the health of the offspring
(Finelli et al. 2021). Even chronic high consumption of alcohol can point to azoospermia, and it has been observed a reduction in the testosterone levels, and a rise
in the FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) in drinkers (Muthusami and Chinnaswamy
2005; Pajarinen and Karhunen 1994). However, if excessive alcohol consumption is
avoided in humans, it could restore normal spermatogenesis (Jensen et al. 2014).

Drug consumers are also related to alcohol and smoking, so the studies only
focused on drugs are lesser. Anyway, it has been described that the consumption of
several drugs can interact with several receptors present in the pituitary gland, testicular tissues and Leydig and Sertoli cells in men. This leads to alteration in the
hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis that affects fertility. Consequently, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, sperm function, spermatogenesis, sperm DNA fragmentation and apoptosis have been observed under drug abuse (Ajayi and Akhigbe
2020; Payne et al. 2019; du Plessis et al. 2015). Air pollution exposition is also
related to fertility in men affecting motility, morphology and fragmentation of the
DNA of sperm (Jurewicz et al. 2018). More recently, a retrospective study showed
azoospermia and a reduction of the motility and volume of the sperm in men exposed

to atmospheric pollution from industrial sources due to the chemical products causing endocrine disruption (Ramsay et al. 2023). Comparable results were observed in
a retrospective longitudinal study in healthy and young men exposed to environmental air pollution, relating particulate matter and carbon oxygen with spermatogenesis (Qiu et al. 2020). Although it is clear that many factors can influence male
fertility, the treatment for males is difficult and limited, and the trouble is normally
resolved by several insemination methods or *in vitro* fertilization (Okonofua
et al. 2022).

Infertility in women has also been described and studied, though the studies are
retrospective and methodologically inconsistent, making the comparison among
them difficult. The reproductive potential in women can be measured by the ovarian
reserve, as the quality and number of oocytes (Practice Committee of the American
Society for Reproductive Medicine. 2020) using transvaginal ultrasonography and
together with the evaluation of the concentrations of several hormones, such as anti-­
mullerian hormone (AMH) or FSH.

The leading causes of female infertility are ovulatory disorders, tubal factor
infertility (e.g., unilateral/bilateral blockage of fallopian tubes), endometriosis,
uterine factors, and age, among others (Table 10.1).

Genetics play a complex and not well-known role in the reproductive outcomes
in females; in the last decade, many common genetic risk factors have been described
to modify hormone concentrations, reproductive characteristics or to be related to
pathologies (Gajbhiye et al. 2018). In a review study, the variations in the hormones
FSH, LH, AMH and oestradiol concentrations were related to different variants on
chromosomes in females pointing out the importance that phenotypes can have in
the age of menopause, ovarian reserve, and infertility (McGrath et al. 2021). Some
treatments have the goal to increase the diminished levels of the hormones in
females. When the pituitary gland suffers from a blockage of the negative feedback,
it allows a rise of the hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH, or
also direct treatments to increase this hormone), which in turn increases the release
of the FSH and LH inducing the growth and stimulation of the follicles (Adashi
1984; Christou et al. 2017; Legro et al. 2014).

There are different alterations or diseases in women that can affect conception,
including anatomical alterations such as malformations in the uterus that can be
corrected through surgery in order to improve fertility and achieve pregnancy
(Bosteels et al. 2018). Among them, ovulatory dysfunctions are usual, being the
polycystic ovary syndrome the main cause of anovulation (Sirmans and Pate 2013).
In this sense, galactorrhoea is another cause of infertility due to a luteal phase defect
and ovulatory cycles (El Mahgoub 1978). As in males, oxidative stress is also implicated in the oocyte quality, viability and fertilization in women. Although there is a
lack of clinical trials in this line, the physiological levels of ROS allow the selection
of the leading follicle (Devine et al. 2012; Shkolnik et al. 2011), and these levels are
higher in a post-ovulatory oocyte since it is part of the mechanisms participating in
the initiation of the apoptosis process when the fertilization does not occur (Aitken
2020; Lord et al. 2015). However, if the antioxidant capacity is diminished in the
ovarian, it could induce local inflammation and fibrosis, which lead to alterations in

the function of the tissue and fertility problems (Shi et al. 2016). It also seems that
sex hormones modulate ROS levels, so that they regulate endometrium shedding.
However, high levels of ROS in the uterus tissue could alter this process in some
diseases, like endometriosis (Mier-Cabrera et al. 2011). Endometriosis is a chronic
inflammatory disease that is oestrogen-dependent in which the proliferation of the
endometrial cells occurs external to the uterine cavity; in consequence, this


-----

alteration affects an important percentage of women in reproductive age since endometrium is basic for implantation and growth of the embryo. The alterations
observed included alterations of the gene profile and the expression of related proteins for implantation; for instance, the progesterone response in females with this
pathology is lower which could explain, at least in part, some of the infertility problems (Zondervan et al. 2020).

Women, in contrast to men, experience a finite period of reproductive capability
determined by the number of primordial follicles. Consequently, traditional chemotherapy drugs can induce an irreversible loss of the function of the ovary and the
absence of menstruation due to a depletion of oocytes (Bedoschi et al. 2016).
Tumour cells can disrupt the normal functioning of reproductive organs, such as the
ovaries or uterus, by occupying space or causing structural changes. This can affect
the release and maturation of oocytes, the ability of the uterus to support a pregnancy, or the production of related hormones (Fabiani et al. 2022; Volodarsky-Perel
et al. 2019). Additionally, cancer can induce an imbalance in hormonal production,
leading to irregular menstrual cycles that can impair fertility. In fact, adnexal
tumours are common in infertile women growing near the uterus, principally in fallopian tubes, ovaries, or closed connective tissues. It can induce irregular menstrual
periods. However, most adnexal tumours are non-cancerous but require treatment
including surgery (Biggs and Marks 2016).

As in men, environmental risk factors, including obesity and sedentary patterns
(Hammoud et al. 2008; Pasquali 2006) smoking and alcohol, exposition to radiation, and pollution, can also alter the reproduction function in females, so as a consequence, infertility problems appear. The overweight and obesity on women’s
fertility influence the ovarian and endometrial functions as consequence of the alterations in the endocrine mechanisms. The main cause derives from the functional

alteration of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis (HPO) (Marinelli et al. 2022).
Higher plasma concentrations of insulin are generally observed in obese women,
which induces a rise in the production ovarian androgen. These androgens are substrates for aromatase that convert them into oestrogens in adipose tissue, which
generates negative feedback on the HPO axis, resulting in a longer follicular phase
and a shortened luteal phase. This manifests as menstrual abnormalities and ovulatory dysfunction (Marinelli et al. 2022). Related to this, polycystic ovarian disease
is a pathology normally found in obese patients. In this case, it has been observed a
diminished abundance of the insulin receptor b-subunit in the adipose tissue of the
women affected by that disease which reduces the sensitivity for the insulin; moreover, these patients show abnormal function of the β-cells and high levels of leptin
that is related to diminished fertility (Macut et al. 2017).

Active and passive smoking also affect fertility in women (Anderson et al. 2011).
The chemicals present in cigarettes induce alterations in hormonal parameters
(lower oestrogens and progesterone levels), ovarian reserve and quality, ovarian
dysfunction, menstrual cycle disorders, endometrial receptivity and early placentation. In fact, tobacco consumption has been related to a significant rise in delay in
conception, greater than 1 year in smoking women (Anderson et al. 2011). It seems
that the current smokers and passive ones (and also the women that suffered utero

exposition) diminish the options of fertilization, but the former smokers recover the
normal capability to get a pregnancy. According to research studies, alcohol consumption has been related to reduced female fertility and a higher risk of suffering
menstrual pathologies, although the mechanism has not been determined. A possible theory for the undesirable effect of alcohol consumption on the fertility in
females could be the alteration of the concentrations of endogenous hormones, a
direct influence on the development of the oocyte, ovulation, the development of the
early blastocyst and implantation (Skoracka et al. 2021). Similarly, addictive drugs
studies in infertility are scarce in humans and mainly focused only on marijuana.
Although many studies are focused on animal models, it has been described that
cannabinoids alter the ovulatory function by means of the interaction with the hypothalamus so that in the HPO axis decreases the pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing
hormone in a dose-dependent manner (Fonseca and Rebelo 2022).
###### **3 Infertility and Dietary Patterns**

The basis of a balanced life is based on maintaining adequate nutrition and a healthy
lifestyle. Following a balanced and complete diet and having active habits are the
foundations of a healthy lifestyle that supports maintaining an adequate weight and
diminishing the risk of non-communicable chronic illnesses (Ng et al. 2020). The
nutritional needs of an individual correspond to the sum of their basic needs and
other variables depending on their age, sex, physiological state, activity and the
environment in which they live. Today it is necessary to think about the importance
of the social cost derived from inadequate nutritional states that lead to an increase
in disorders and pathologies with a clear nutritional background.

At present, there is a consensus that changes in diet can promote health protection and prevent disorders caused by excesses, deficits and, above all, dietary imbalances. Today, perhaps the concept that best defines the message to be conveyed in
relation to recommended nutrition is healthy eating. In this term are added the concepts of sufficiency both in energy and nutrients), variety to ensure the contributions
of macro and micronutrients, balance in the recommended proportions and adaptation to the social and cultural characteristics of each person. All this should promote
a healthy lifestyle and that is supported by the agreed nutritional recommendations
for the population of our environment.

Nutritional epidemiology basically seeks to identify elements of the diet that are
linked to a greater or lesser risk of disease. Scientific evidence supports the relevant
role of numerous dietary and nutritional aspects in the development of various diseases of high importance in public health, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases,
diabetes or mental illnesses. Although the effects of micronutrients, such as antioxidants, have been demonstrated, the complex relationships established between
nutrients have led to working with global indices or dietary patterns, for instance,
the Mediterranean diet pattern. The great variety of foods, with their combinations
of nutrients that make up a specific dietary pattern, can interact and have both


-----

synergistic and antagonistic effects, making it necessary to evaluate their global
effects.

Infertility is a common phenomenon today, increasing every year the number of
couples who cannot conceive. Fertility in humankind is influenced by numerous
factors, including aspects that affect the females such as uterine disorders or ovulation disturbances, and other aspects that affect the males such as abnormal sperm
production and function, various non-modifiable factors such as genetics or age, and
most significantly, lifestyle factors that can be modified such as nutrition, physical
activity / sedentary lifestyle, overweight, alcohol, smoking, chronic stress and prolonged utilization of contraceptives (Acharya and Gowda 2017). Although it is
widely acknowledged that nutrition significantly influences fertility outcomes for
both women and men, there are currently no official recommendations provided for
couples in the reproductive age group. (Rossi et al. 2016). Nutrition can exert positive or negative effects on fertility in both women and men, and the influence is
dependent on different properties of the diet, both measurable and descriptive ones,
including caloric content and profiles of fatty acids, proteins, and carbohydrate and
micronutrient balance (Panth et al. 2018).

Diverse studies have revealed that nutritional patterns can play a basic part in the
development of fertility disorders when considered as a whole and not as individual
food components. This makes sense since people generally eat a complex combination of meals and not separate nutrients. A dietary pattern could be explained as the
quantity, and how diverse foods and beverages are combined in diets, along with
their consumption frequency. In addition, studying the effects of eating patterns can
provide more accurate information on the association among disease and diet than
the information based on individual nutrients or foods. In fact, for both sexes, a
prevalent aspect in many cases of infertility is the presence of chronic inflammation
and oxidative stress; these challenges can be ameliorated through adopting healthy
practices, including the incorporation of an antioxidant-rich diet and bioactive compounds with anti-inflammatory activity (Barati et al. 2020; Ojo et al. 2023).

Within the healthiest dietary patterns, the traditional Mediterranean diet would
be the most relevant example (Fig. 10.2). This dietary pattern has been associated
with numerous helpful health effects, from reduced risk of death from any cause to
numerous illnesses as it can be cancer, cognitive deterioration or cardiovascular
disease (Ros et al. 2014).

In various meta-analyses, it has been shown that in recent years semen quality
has decreased in men and ovulatory infertility increased in women which have been
largely associated with progressive worsening in diet (Chavarro and Schlaff 2018;
Chiu et al. 2018; Nassan et al. 2018a). It has been described that following the
Mediterranean diet closely has the potential to enhance rates of pregnancy and live
births, although the results are not entirely clear because of the heterogeneity of the
works analysed (Winter et al. 2023). An interesting study has shown that following
a Mediterranean pattern rose wealthy pregnancies by nearly 40% among couples
who underwent in vitro fertilization (Vujkovic et al. 2010). In addition, the
Mediterranean dietary model was also positively related to blood vitamin B6 and
folate and in follicular fluid for vitamin B6, important for the homocysteine

**Fig. 10.2** Basic features of the Mediterranean and Western diets with potential positive and negative effects of fertility

pathway. In the case of men, various studies have shown improvements in sperm
parameters associated with the Mediterranean diet pattern.

In a cross-sectional work, 225 men joining a fertility health centre were classified into tertiles based on their degree of adherence to the Mediterranean diet
(Karayiannis et al. 2017). The results revealed that men in the highest adherent tertile had lesser probabilities of presenting non-standard total sperm count and motility and sperm concentration, with respect to men in the lowest tertile. The authors
conclude, however, whether these observed changes translate into increased male
fertility is still incomplete. In a second study, it has been investigated whether there
is a relation between semen quality factors and following the Mediterranean dietary
model in 106 healthy and young men (Salas-Huetos et al. 2019). Using a multivariate linear regression model applied to evaluate the association between the parameters of the sperm quality and tertiles of adherence to the Mediterranean diet, higher
total sperm motility was observed in the tertile with the highest adherence.

Regarding women, in a prospective study (Nurses Health Cohort Study II)
17,544 women without previous infertility problems were included, it was evidenced that those women with lesser consumption of food related to ovulatory disorder infertility presented an inferior risk of alterations in fertility than those who
had a higher consumption after 8 years of follow-up (Chavarro et al. 2007). The
work concluded that most cases of infertility because of ovulation alterations could
be avoided or significantly reduced by diet and lifestyle modifications. However, in
this same cohort of women, no relationship was observed concerning a higher
adherence to the Mediterranean pattern and the risk of suffering incident spontaneous abortions and stillbirths (Gaskins et al. 2014b). In a nested work involving 485
young women that had difficulties to get pregnant and 1669 controls, lesser difficulties to conceive were observed in women in the highest quartile of adherence to the
Mediterranean pattern when compared with the lowest one (Toledo et al. 2011). The
authors conclude the need to create nutritional strategies for women who wish to


-----

become pregnant since it will reduce infertility rates. In a cohort study with 244
women who were non-obese, undertook prospectively a first IVF treatment, no relationship was found with the grade of adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern
on embryo quality measures, fertilization rate, and oocyte yield, nor with the establishment process (Karayiannis et al. 2018). In contrast, higher adherence was related
to higher amounts of pregnancy and live birth suggesting that women undergoing
IVF treatment will have a higher successful pregnancy if the adherence to the
Mediterranean dietary pattern was stronger. Also, in a randomized controlled clinical trial, it was observed how a two-year nutritional intervention with a Mediterranean
diet in women with sexual dysfunction together with metabolic syndrome improved
the sexual function index (Esposito et al. 2007).

Conversely, following a Westernized diet model, based on high caloric intake,
red meat consumption, added sugars, refined carbohydrates, unhealthy fats, and
processed foods, is linked to obesity and negative effects on fertility. In this sense,
the Western diet affects parameters such as the amounts of hormones, and function
and concentration of sperm, and gamete composition (Meldrum et al. 2017). When
comparing different parameters of sperm quality among 209 young and healthy
subjects who followed the Mediterranean diet with respect to others who adhered to
a more Western diet, it has been observed that those who followed more to the
Mediterranean dietary pattern had not only higher sperm levels, but also better body
mass index and healthier lifestyle (Cutillas-Toĺn et al. 2015). Nevertheless, it
remains to be clarified if the described differences in the parameters of the semen
translate into differences in fertility rates between pairs who wish to conceive. In a
retrospective study carried out on 5598 pregnant women, it was described that
higher consumption of fast food and a lesser consumption of fruit were related to
increases in time to pregnancy, revealing how a more Western diet can make conception difficult (Grieger et al. 2018). The importance of changes in some elements
of the diet is evident in a study in which healthy men following a Western diet were
supplemented with nuts (60 grams during 14 weeks), where improvements were
achieved in overall sperm count, motility and morphology when compared to the
control individuals (Salas-Huetos et al. 2018). In addition, a decrease in the degree
of damage and fragmentation of sperm DNA was observed, which could justify the
improvements observed.

An important factor related to diet, in addition to a sedentary lifestyle which can
lead to infertility is overweight and obesity. These terms included an abnormal or
excessive build-up of fat, are a global burden due to their effects on health and at the
socio-sanitary level. In both women and men, overweight/obesity are related to a
longer term for conception, in addition to being a risk issue for the development of
chronic diseases that affect the evolution of pregnancy (Baheerati and Devi 2018).
In this sense, in a study where a total of 159 infertile subjects (men and women) and
143 fertile subjects were analysed, it was shown that physical inactivity and having
values of fat mass above the reference values were positively associated with infertility (Foucaut et al. 2019). From a fertility point of view, the influence of overweight and obesity is mainly due to endocrine mechanisms mostly derived from the
functional alteration of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG) (Broughton

283


and Moley 2017; Hammoud et al. 2008). In the case of women, ovulatory dysfunction is the main reason of female infertility, which in many cases is a consequence
of PCOS that usually occurs with obesity. In addition, obesity is related to a rise in
the degree of oxidative stress and a state of subclinical chronic inflammation that
also contributes to reduced fertility (Manna and Jain 2015). In this sense, it has been
shown that following a Mediterranean diet significantly reduces the risk of insulin
resistance and weight gain, which can favour fertility and the probability of pregnancy. Furthermore, the Mediterranean diet is characterized by being rich in bioactive compounds that can help reduce oxidative stress and the proinflammatory state.
Thus, it should be emphasized that weight loss should be established as a strategy
for obese people with infertility troubles, since it allows normalizing the hormonal
balance and reducing the pro-oxidative state (McGrice and Porter 2017; Ricci et al.
2018). A meta-analysis examining weight loss interventions in infertile and overweight women found that participants assigned to a food regime and exercise intervention were more prone to achieving pregnancy and a live birth than women in
control groups (Hunter et al. 2021). In another work, the combined effects of a
4-month nutritional and physical activity intervention were investigated in a randomized controlled trial including 263 healthy young men (Montano et al. 2022).
After the intervention, an increase in the concentration of the sperm and progressive
motility was observed, while the proportion of spermatozoa with abnormal morphology was reduced in the individuals of the intervention group. The authors conclude that lifestyle interventions are recommendable strategies to protect and
improve semen quality in young men. Conversely, it has also been shown that low-­
weight women (body mass index <19 kg/m [2] ) take longer to become pregnant than
normal-weight women, probably due to inhibition of the HPG axis due to chronic
energy deficiency (Fontana and Della Torre 2016).

However, sometimes following a presumably healthy diet can hide risks that
should be taken into consideration. In this sense, healthy diets are usually associated
with an increase in foods of plant origin, which may contain chemical substances
derived from pest control. Many of the pesticides used to act as endocrine disruptors
can have effects even in minute concentrations. Results proposes that intake of
foods from plants with considerable amounts of pesticides affects fertility in both
men (testicular atrophy, reduced spermatogenesis, lower total sperm concentration
and motility, etc.) and women (oestrous cycle defects, altered folliculogenesis, follicular atresia, etc.), in addition to being related to implantation defects, endometriosis, spontaneous abortions, foetal, and other birth defects (Bhardwaj et al. 2020;
Mehrpour et al. 2014). Another factor to consider is the recommendation to increase
the consumption of fish, especially oily fish with heart-healthy fats. However, these
fish are usually large pelagic animals that accumulate methylmercury in their tissues, a compound with the capacity to produce neurotoxicity and reproductive disorders if consumed in excess (Mínguez-Alarcón et al. 2018). Alcohol consumption
is another element to consider in relation to fertility. Although the Mediterranean
dietary pattern comprises a modest amount of alcohol consumption (low-proof and
non-distilled), its consumption is related to a decline in sperm quality and menstrual
dysfunction, abortion, and ovulation disorders (Gabrielsen and Tanrikut 2016;


-----

284


A. Sureda et al.


María del Mendoza-López et al. 2015). In this sense, it has been shown that patients
with azoospermia associated with chronic alcohol consumption recovered normal
semen parameters in less than 3 months (Sermondade et al. 2010).
###### **4 Nutrients and Infertility**

Nutrients play a pivotal role in fertility for both men and women (González-­
Rodríguez et al. 2018). Proper nutrition plays a crucial role in ensuring the optimal
operation of the reproductive system and the overall health of individuals.
Additionally, a balanced and varied diet, along with a healthy lifestyle, can help
ensure an adequate intake of nutrients for overall reproductive health (Silva et al.
2019). While certain nutrients are important for reproductive health, it is essential to
note that nutrient deficiencies have also been related to a higher risk of infertility
(Bindari et al. 2013). Therefore, adhering to a nutritious and diverse diet holds significant promise for the reproductive well-being of both men and women.
Nevertheless, beyond achieving a balance in macronutrients, the specific sources
and quantities of individual micronutrients are crucial, as they dictate the impact of
diet on fertility. ***4.1 Macronutrients***

When dealing with macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins and lipids) not only is
important their caloric content, but for a good state of health dietary macronutrient
balance and quality must be considered (Senior et al. 2019). In this sense, Western
diets also frequently comprise excessively refined sugars, with negative impacts on
health by promoting insulin resistance and type II diabetes. Typically, Western diets
exhibit an abundance of saturated fats (SFAs) and trans fatty acids, along with an
unfavourable ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids. Furthermore, maintaining a
good balance of amino acids is vital for development, reproductive health, as well
as cardiometabolic well-being and aging.

**4.1.1 Fats**

The prevention of fertility-related issues is significantly influenced by both the
quantity and quality of consumed fatty acids. SFAs are abundant in foods derived
from animals including processed meat, red meat, and whole-fat dairy products,
may have adverse effects on fertility. On the contrary, monounsaturated and PUFAs
are fats mainly present in vegetable foods and fish with positive effects on fertility
(Benatta et al. 2020). However, among the fats, trans fatty acids, present mainly in


-----

10 Nutraceuticals and Infertility


285


fast and processed food, snacks and ready-made confectionery, tend to exert the
most detrimental influence on fertility.

Trans fatty acids have proinflammatory characteristics and also induce insulin
resistance, rising the probability of evolving type 2 diabetes or other metabolic disorders, including polycystic ovary syndrome (Çekici and Akdevelioğlu 2019)
directly related to infertility. In this sense, in a study where 2416 healthy women
were followed for a minimum of 1 year or until they got pregnant, a relationship was
observed between an elevated consumption of trans fatty acids and a low omega-3
consumption with reduced fertility (Wise et al. 2018). Moreover, there is evidence
indicating that the intake of trans fatty acids and SFAs is linked to a high risk of
anovulatory infertility and endometriosis. Conversely, the consumption of PUFAs is
related to elevated levels of luteal progesterone and estrogen, along with a reduced
probability of anovulation (Chiu et al. 2018; Jurkiewicz-Przondziono et al. 2017).
In the case on men, it has been reported negative effects of dietary trans and saturated fat on sperm parameters, specifically, it has been related to decreased total
amounts and concentration of the sperm, and poor quality of the semen (Attaman
et al. 2012; Jensen et al. 2013). On the one hand, the consumption of trans-saturated
fat has been linked to reduced testosterone levels and decreased testicular volume,
both indicative of compromised testicular function (Chavarro et al. 2014; Mínguez-­
Alarcón et al. 2017). Additionally, omega-3 PUFAs were related to greater seminal
parameters and testicular volume (Attaman et al. 2012; Chavarro et al. 2014; Jensen
et al. 2013; Mínguez-Alarcón et al. 2017). Specifically, it has been indicated that
palmitic acid (C16:0) concentration was greater in infertile men in front of decreased
concentrations of PUFAs (Gulaya et al. 2001; Khosrowbeygi and Zarghami 2007;
Tavilani et al. 2006). As well as, researchers have shown that a main PUFA in human
spermatozoa is docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3). So, a lack of it in sperm cells
is a common indication of infertility in men (Aksoy et al. 2006; Martínez-Soto et al.
2013). The importance of the fatty acid profile in men is due to the structure of the
membrane of the sperm cell, a critical component for its proper functioning. This
membrane has a fundamental part in the fertilization steps, including uptake, the
reaction of the acrosome, and the fusion of sperm and oocytes. Long-chain PUFAs
in the human sperm membrane cannot be synthesized endogenously, so they require
to be obtained from the diet (vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, shellfish), which is why the
consumption of such Food in men has been linked to a greater percentage of sperm
with normal morphology and higher sperm parameters (Nassan et al. 2018a).

**4.1.2 Proteins**

Another important component of the diet for fertility is the origin and quality of the
protein ingested. A deficiency in protein can play a role in infertility by affecting the
necessary structural components. This is evident in reported reductions in the weight
of the epididymis, testicles, and seminal vesicles, as well as a decrease in the circulating concentration of testosterone in men (Ferramosca and Zara 2022). However,
the main problem usually comes from an excess protein intake, especially of animal


-----

A. Sureda et al.


origin, while that from vegetables is reduced. In accordance, it has been shown that
elevated intake of animal proteins is associated with a greater risk of ovulatory disorders, while if proteins of vegetable origin predominate, fertility increases in
women aged over 32 years. (Chavarro et al. 2008a). In another study carried out in
healthy women without dietary restrictions, it was observed that those located in the
tertile with the lowest intake of plant-based proteins presented lower luteal phase
progesterone, higher follicle-stimulating hormone, and a higher risk of anovulation
(Kim et al. 2021). In relation to men, an inverse relationship has been observed
between higher consumption of animal protein and a poor quality of the sperm
(Chavarro et al. 2011). Similarly, in a work where men with reduced semen quality
and healthy men were analysed, it was observed that those with infertility ingested
more protein of animal origin (Mendiola et al. 2009). One of the possible causes
may be the differential response that proteins induce on insulin production. Thus,
the insulin reaction is less pronounced when consuming proteins from vegetables
compared to animal ones (Chen et al. 2020). In addition, the greater consumption of
animal protein is parallel to the greater consumption of SFAs, which can favour
infertility in a combined way.

Within protein consumption, the importance of red meat, and mainly the processed one, in relation to infertility should be highlighted. A research study conducted in the United States (US) explored the connection between meat consumption
and semen quality parameters, revealing a robust inverse correlation between the
intake of processed red meat and both total sperm count and ejaculate volume
(Afeiche et al. 2014). Another study in China revealed that a higher consumption of
processed meat may rise the risk of suffering asthenozoospermia (Liu et al. 2022),
which is a primary factor contributing to the infertility in males, with absent or
diminished sperm motility. (Tu et al. 2020). Nevertheless, consumption of untreated
meat and raw vegetable might lessen asthenozoospermia risk (Liu et al. 2022). A
recent study associated diets abundant in sweets, potatoes, red and processed meats
and sweetened drinks with reduced semen quality, while the opposite effect had
been seen with higher consumption of grains, poultry, fruits and vegetables and
seafood (Gaskins and Chavarro 2018). Another study reported that women who
intake >2 servings per day of red meat increased the risk to suffer endometriosis
about 56% in comparison with those who consume ≤1 serving per week (Yamamoto
et al. 2018).

Also highlight the benefits of fish protein as long as large pelagic are avoided due
to the accumulation of toxins, especially heavy metals. In this sense, it has been
observed that changing a meat service for a fish service increases fertility in assisted
reproductive technology (Nassan et al. 2018b).

**4.1.3 Carbohidrates**

As previously mentioned, it seems that insulin plays a relevant role in infertility.
Thus, lipid metabolism and above all the glycaemic index and load are dietary factors to consider (Skoracka et al. 2021). Continued consumption of high glycaemic


-----

10 Nutraceuticals and Infertility


287


index foods is associated with hyperinsulinemia, higher fasting glucose levels, and
insulin resistance, which also leads to increased insulin-like growth-factor I (IGF-I)
concentrations and androgens (Willis et al. 2020). All of this can contribute to
female endocrine disturbances and, therefore, could be linked to a poor development of the oocyte and reduced fertility. In a prospective study, 18,555 fertile
women who wished to become pregnant were followed for 8 years (Chavarro et al.
2009). During the development of the study, a total of 438 women presented ovulatory infertility. When analysing the results, a direct correlation was found between
the overall consumption of carbohydrates and the dietary glycemic load with issues
related to ovulatory function. In a meta-analysis focused on women with PCOS,
low-glycaemic diets decreased insulin resistance, improved lipid profile, and
reduced testosterone levels, indicating potential beneficial effects on infertility
(Kazemi et al. 2021). In the case of men, it appears that an raised glycaemic load
might be related to elevated rates of infertility due to increased oxidative stress and
insulin resistance and decreased levels of testosterone. Insulin resistance can reduce

glucose uptake and utilization by reducing ATP concentration, which can affect
sperm motility (Dias et al. 2014). The rise of the levels in the oxidative stress biomarkers and the reduction in testosterone can affect the mitochondria, reducing
their respiratory efficiency and, consequently, contributing to the decline in sperm
motility (Ferramosca et al. 2013).

Within carbohydrates, various studies have shown the negative effects on both
female and male fertility of the high consumption of sweetened drinks. In a study
with 189 healthy young men, it was observed how the consumption of sugar-­
sweetened beverages was related to lesser motility of the sperm (Chiu et al. 2014).
Similarly, in a prospective study of 3628 women planning pregnancy, those who
consumed three or more sugar-sweetened soft drinks reported a pregnancy rate of
52% that was lower than women who did not consume these drinks (Hatch
et al. 2012).

On the other hand, the increase in the intake of indigestible carbohydrates, such
as fibre, seems to be associated with an increased probability of conception, although
the results in this regard are few and further study is required. Its beneficial effects
would come from its ability to reduce the rate of carbohydrate uptake, reducing
blood glucose (Willis et al. 2020). In addition, the fermentation of the fibre can
improve the quality of the microbiota and provide benefits for the health of the host
(Makki et al. 2018). However, in one study it was shown that a high fibre intake
reduced levels of sex hormones and increased anovulatory cycles (Gaskins
et al. 2009).
###### ***4.2 Micronutrients***

The existence of relations of specific foods and nutrients to fertility can give a significant idea of the probable mechanisms associated with diet quality to reproductive health. Micronutrients play an important role in different physiological

A. Sureda et al.


**Table 10.2** Role of essential micronutrients on the healthy reproduction of both male and female

|---|---|---|
|Selenium|Vital for spermatogenesis, semen function and semen quality|Potential effect on the placenta Adequate development of foetus’ nervous system|
|Zinc|Testosterone synthesis Improve androgen|Importance in oocyte maturation and development and on oocyte quality.|
|Iron|Necessary for spermatogenesis and spermatozoa metabolism Reduces sperm quality and sperm morphology and motility|Overload levels: Provoke reproductive disorders, such as endometriosis, preeclampsia and pregnancy complication|
|Folic acid|Essential role in spermatogenesis|Reduces risk of ovulatory infertility; improves chances of pregnancy|

processes for the human being, including reproductive health. These are basic nutrients necessary in minimal amounts for development, typical growth, and overall
well-being. They include vitamins (vitamins A, C, E, folate, B12), and minerals
(iron, selenium, and zinc). Micronutrients contribute to the correct function of the
reproductive system in both males and females, especially in pregnant women
(Table 10.2) (Hosseini and Eslamian 2015; Tvrdá et al. 2021). However, the intake
of dietary supplements should be approached cautiously, as an excessive consumption can have adverse effects on overall human health.

In males, certain micronutrients are crucial for maintaining sperm health, quality,
and motility. Zinc, for instance, is necessary for the testosterone production and
spermatogenesis. Deficiencies in zinc have been related to decreased sperm count
and injured sperm function (Osadchuk et al. 2021). Other antioxidants, like vitamin
C, selenium, and vitamin E, help protect sperm from oxidative damage, which can
affect their viability and fertilizing capacity (Dimitriadis et al. 2023).

In females, micronutrients are essential for optimal hormonal balance, healthy
ovulation, and a receptive environment for fertilization and implantation (Hosseini
and Eslamian 2015). In the Nurses Health Cohort Study II, multivitamin supplementation is contrariwise associated with anovulatory dysfunction (Chavarro et al.
2008b). Iron, for example, has a pivotal role in the production of haemoglobin,
which carries oxygen to the reproductive organs. Insufficient iron levels can lead to

289


anaemia, which may negatively impact fertility (Kadhum and Al-Shammaree 2021).
Folate, a B-vitamin, is vital for cell division and DNA synthesis, and its deficiency
has been linked to fertility problems and neural tube defects in early pregnancy
(Ebisch et al. 2007).

**4.2.1 Selenium**

Selenium (Se) is a crucial micronutrient, which deficiency or excess is related to
gamete dysfunction and gonadal insufficiency in both females and males, developing to unsuccessful implantation, altered embryonic growth, and infertility (Dahlen
et al. 2022). As well as, during pregnancy, Se deficiency or overload is related to
gestational diabetes, miscarriage, foetal growth restriction, preeclampsia, and preterm birth (Dahlen et al. 2022). In women, Se is a part of selenoproteins displaying
antioxidant features and is vital for spermatogenesis, DNA protection and the male
fertility’s preservation, since oxidative stress plays a vital role in male infertility. Se
has antioxidative features and is vital for spermatogenesis and the preservation of
fertility in man. Decreased levels of selenium have negative effects on human reproductive health, sperm function, semen quality and, consequently, fertility potency in
men (Mirnamniha et al. 2019). Also, adequate ranks of Se are necessary for normal
spermatogenesis and sperm maturation. Dietary selenium ought to be in optimum
measure to avoid infertility and preserve reproductive function in males (Ahsan
et al. 2014). Se is also essential due to its potential to decrease oxidative stress in the
placenta, along with the proper development of the foetal nervous system (Habibi
et al. 2020).

**4.2.2 Zinc**

Zinc is one of the metals that plays extensive physiological functions in hundreds of
proteins and in enzymes for adequate development. Among its functions, zinc is a
cofactor for several proteins participating in the antioxidant balance; therefore, it
has an important function against oxidative stress. In women, zinc deficiency has
been linked to decreased pregnancy rates and abnormal menstruation, as well as to
require more time to get pregnant (Kohil et al. 2022). Moreover, it has been evidenced the significance of zinc in oocyte development and maturation, as well as,
the effects of zinc on oocyte quality protecting against ROS. A deficiency in zinc
results in dysfunctional antioxidant enzymes and an increment of ROS accumulation causing infertility diseases, such as endometriosis (Camp et al. 2023). In men,
zinc has a diverse impact on both fertility and sperm function. It is essential for the
adequate development of the testicles, normal spermatogenesis, and protection of
the Leydig cells from damage through its antioxidant capabilities (Beigi Harchegani
et al. 2020). Zinc insufficiency is also described to be related to oxidative damage
and apoptosis of Leydig cells, a decrease in the production and secretion of testosterone and impaired spermatogenesis (Te et al. 2023).

290

**4.2.3 Iron**


A. Sureda et al.


Iron is a crucial micronutrient for maintaining human well-being, although deficient
or excessive iron levels have been associated with dysregulated reproductive health.
It is necessary for the formation of sperms and spermatozoa metabolism, so iron
deficiency blocks spermatogenesis. Moreover, an excess of iron might stimulate
male infertility by rising oxidative damage to sperm via the Fenton reaction.
Increased levels of iron in seminal plasma have been related to low sperm quality
and negative sperm morphology and motility, which are mediated by oxidative
damage. Deficiency in iron together with the anaemia that can induce are widespread among women, in particular of reproductive age. In women, insufficient iron
levels are associated with negative health outcomes that can impact both physical
and emotional well-being. Furthermore, low iron levels can lead to impaired fertility and pathological alterations in vital reproductive tissues or organs, including the
ovaries and endometrium. Among women experiencing infertility attributed to ovulatory disorders, the intake of iron supplements was associated with a markedly
reduced risk of ovulatory infertility compared to those who did not take supplements (Chavarro et al. 2006). However, an iron overload in women may also provoke reproductive disorders, such as endometriosis, preeclampsia, and pregnancy
complication (Li et al. 2023).

**4.2.4 Folic Acid (Vitamin B9)**

Water-soluble B9 vitamins are vital, and among them, there are the folate. Their
importance is because of one-carbon synthesis and epigenetic processes. Moreover,
folate is crucial for the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and proteins, making it essential
during stages of quick cell development and proliferation, including the maturation
of the germ cell and the pregnancy growth. Folates can be acquired in diet, especially in beans, legumes, whole grains, dark green leafy vegetables, juices, citrus
fruits, and milk. Folic acid, as a synthetic form of folate, could be ingested as fortified foods or nutritional supplements. A low-quality diet or malabsorption of folate
can be the origin of its deficiency in humans. Inadequate levels of key micronutrients crucial for folate metabolism, such as vitamins B2, B6, and B12, along with
iron and zinc, can lead to the occurrence of functional folate deficiency (Laanpere
et al. 2010). Folate plays an essential part in spermatogenesis, thus, folate deficiency
decrease significantly the gene expression involved in spermatogenesis, resulting in
a reduced sperm concentration (Yuan et al. 2017). Especially, a folic acid deficiency
increases the methylation of significant genes causing sperm DNA damage (Wang
et al. 2022). Folic acid also decreases the risk of ovulatory infertility and increases
the chances of pregnancy in females. In this sense, elevated folate intake in women
undergoing in vitro fertilisation was related to an augmented ratio of implantation
and live births (Gaskins et al. 2014a).

**4.2.5 Vitamin E**


291


Vitamin E, alpha-tocopherol, is an important antioxidant present in semen that plays
an essential role to prevent the functional competence of sperm cells exposed to an
oxidative attack (Thérond et al. 1996). In fact, the concentration of vitamin E in
seminal plasma is related to sperm motility and, consequently, insufficiency of vitamin E was observed in the semen of interfile men, evidencing oligozoospermia,
azoospermia, and asthenozoospermia (Omu et al. 1999). Moreover, an association
between decreased vitamin E in dysfunctional sperm and higher production of ROS
was reported. A randomized controlled study conducted across multiple centres
provided prospective evidence that vitamin E can enhance the percentage of motile
sperm, sperm concentration, and the rate of natural pregnancy (Chen et al. 2012). A
cross-sectional study conducted on females evidenced that an appropriate quantity
of vitamin E in the follicle improves the possibility of oocyte maturation, which
translates in a better reproductive outcome after intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection
in infertile females (Ashraf et al. 2020). In females, vitamin E also participates in
placenta development and the implantation of the fertilized egg (Mohd Mutalip
et al. 2018).

**4.2.6 Vitamin A**

Vitamin A (retinol) has been known to be indispensable for spermatogenesis and for
the spermatozoa maturation in the epididymis (Chung and Wolgemuth 2004).
Specifically, retinol acts on both Sertoli cells and germ cells to induce in the undifferentiated spermatogonia their differentiation. All-trans-retinoic acid, which is the
active form of vitamin A, binds to nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs), and retinoid X receptors (RXRs), that modulate the transcriptional activity of goal genes
regulating continuous spermatogenesis (Wolgemuth and Chung 2007). Previous
results reported that the total motility and number of sperm were positively correlated with serum levels of retinol. In females, vitamin A is important for oocyte
maturation and ovarian steroid production. Also, retinoic acid may play an essential
role in folliculogenesis (ovarian follicular growth) and the growth of oocyte competency, contributing to an effective fertilization (Best et al. 2015). Specifically, retinoic acid is necessary for the antral follicles for granulosa cell differentiation
modulated by FSH and the reproductive capacity of the ovaries.

**4.2.7 Vitamin C**

Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is a non-enzymatic antioxidant that detoxifies free radicals in the aqueous phase. Vitamin C is regarded the main antioxidant
in seminal plasma, eliminating ROS but also serving to recycle oxidized vitamin E
(Luck et al. 1995). There are some results that evidence that supplementation of
vitamin C in infertile men may help sperm motility, sperm morphology, sperm

count, and as well as semen quality (Akmal et al. 2006). However, other studies
have described slight or no outcome of vitamin C on seminal parameters or as protection against DNA fragmentation, however when it is used together with other
antioxidants like selenium or vitamin E, do obvious recoveries occur. In women, it
has been shown that treatment with vitamin C had a significant effect on improving
the fecundity function of ovaries, as well as, prevent to endometriosis (Hoorsan
et al. 2022). Also, a cohort study reported prospectively a positive relationship
between vitamin C consumption and fertilization taxes in couples experiencing
assisted reproductive technology (Li et al. 2019).

**4.2.8 Vitamin D**

Vitamin D is an important micronutrient whose function is promoting bone mineralization and preserving calcium and phosphorus homeostasis (Gil et al. 2018).
Moreover, it has been evidenced that vitamin D also acts as a sex steroid hormone,
the typical regulator of reproduction for humankind which can regulate reproductive processes in men and women. In fact, the vitamin D receptor (VDR) has been
found in the reproductive tissues of women and men. In women, this vitamin may
impact in the steroidogenesis of sex hormones (progesterone and oestradiol) but
increased levels could be related to endometriosis. However, various cohort studies
have not found any clear association between vitamin D plasma levels with the risk
of ovulatory infertility, chances of conceiving and risk of spontaneous abortion
(Gaskins and Chavarro 2018). Instead, supplementation of vitamin D may enhance
metabolic disturbances and menstrual frequency in women suffering from PCOS
and also increase pregnancy rates after in vitro fertilisation. It is reported a direct
effect on the endometrium by the vitamin D on in vitro fertilisation. Regarding men,
vitamin D is found to be positively associated with semen quality, androgen status
and an increment of testosterone levels (Lerchbaum and Obermayer-Pietsch 2012).

**4.2.9 Vitamin B12**

Vitamin B12, cobalamin, is essential for human growth, development acting as a
cofactor in fatty acid synthesis and DNA. Moreover, this vitamin can protect DNA
from the damage induced by the free radicals and decrease homocysteine toxicity
(Hosseinabadi et al. 2020). In males, it has been shown that supplements with vitamin B12 could enhance sperm quality, increasing sperm amount and sperm motility
and decreasing the damage in the sperm DNA (Hosseinabadi et al. 2020). A vitamin
B12 supplement is capable to induce the activity of sperm via rising mitotic activity
in Sertoli cells. In females, vitamin B12 prevents spontaneous abortion and congenital defects due to its essential role in the growth and functionality of the placenta. For this reason, an insufficient intake of vitamin B12 may cause reduced
foetal growth and, consequently, vegetarian women may need supplementation of
vitamin B12 (Hovdenak and Haram 2012).

10 Nutraceuticals and Infertility
###### ***4.3 Caffeine***


293


Caffeine is a natural chemical located in drinks made from coffee, but also many
manufacturers add it to their sodas and energy drinks. Caffeine has the power to
stimulate the brain and the central nervous system, avoiding being sleepy in order to
keep active. Caffeine consumption might have adverse effects on the reproduction
in males; nevertheless, the studied parameters related to fertility and semen are
unreliable and unsatisfying. However, it has been suggested that consuming coffee
(<6 cups per day) can to reduce fertility in pairs (Hassan and Killick 2004).
Altogether, it is necessary design well works, in which the selection of the participants, semen analysis and lifestyle habits are predefined to discover reliable effects
of the caffeine on male fertility and semen parameters (Ricci et al. 2017). In women,
the results are not clear either, although there seems to be an increased risk of spontaneous abortion if the women take caffeine previous to the pregnancy more than
400 mg per day (Gaskins et al. 2018).
###### **5 Conclusions**

Infertility is a complex and multifactorial issue that can affect both men and women.
Fertility disorders have become one of the main reproductive health problems, especially in developed countries, where the voluntary delay in the reproductive plan has
led to a progressive increase in maternity age, as well as an increase in the incidence
of reproductive dysfunctions associated with germinal aging. While clinical conditions such as ovulatory, testicular and hormonal alterations are the primary causes
of infertility, lifestyle factors like avoiding tobacco smoking, drugs, alcohol consumption, sedentarism and diet can also impact fertility. In fact, diverse dietary and
lifestyle components might help diminishing the risk of fertility alterations in the
reproductive-age population and might also be an effective approach for women and
men already experiencing infertility. Considering that prevention is the most effective tactic to face up the fertility disorders in human couples; consuming a diet high
in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and healthy fats and avoiding processed and
saturated fats may improve fertility outcomes in both men and women. Moreover,
maintaining body weight through adequate nutrition and also promoting physical
activity is key to improving fertility in men and women. More standardized integration of nutrition advice into treatment delivery for infertility is required, since there
are solid described results that following eating habits that are healthy and adopted
before conception in both men and women have beneficial effects on fertility.

###### **Glossary**


A. Sureda et al.


**Assisted reproductive technology** Medical procedures and interventions used to

assist couples or individuals in achieving pregnancy, such as in vitro fertilization
(IVF), intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), and embryo transfer.
**Asthenozoospermia** Asthenozoospermia refers to a condition characterized by

reduced sperm motility or poor sperm movement. It is a common form of male
infertility where the majority of sperm present in the semen exhibit decreased
motility, making it difficult for them to swim effectively and reach the egg for
fertilization.

**Azoospermia** Azoospermia is a condition characterized by the absence of sperm in

the ejaculated semen is known as azoospermia. This can occur due to either the
man's inability to produce sperm or the obstruction preventing the sperm from
entering the semen.
**Endocrine disruptors** Substances, often found in certain chemicals or environ
mental pollutants, that can interfere with the normal functioning of the endocrine
system, leading to adverse effects on hormone regulation and various aspects of
health and development.
**Endometriosis** Chronic condition characterized by the presence of endometrial-­

like tissue outside the uterus, causing pain and potential fertility issues.
**Folliculogenesis** Folliculogenesis refers to the process of the development and

maturation of ovarian follicles in the female reproductive system. It involves
a series of complex cellular and hormonal interactions that occur in the ovary.
**Mediterranean diet** It is a pattern of healthy eating originating in the Mediterranean

area that is characterized by a great diversity of foods and a predominance
of foods of vegetable origin and consumption of fresh foods or with minimal
transformations.

**Oligozoospermia** Oligozoospermia or oligospermia is a sperm alteration which

consist of a decrease in the number of spermatozoa in the ejaculated semen count.
**Polycystic ovarian disease** Hormonal disorder characterized by multiple cysts on

the ovaries, menstrual irregularities, excess androgen production, and various
symptoms including infertility, acne, and hirsutism.
**Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)** Dietary fat that contains more than one

double bond in their chemical structure, and are essential for various physiological functions in the body, including cell membrane integrity, hormone production, and cardiovascular health.
**Processed food** Products modified by the addition or introduction of substances

(salt, sugar, oil, preservatives and/or additives) that change the nature of the
original foods, in order to prolong their duration, make them more pleasant or
attractive.

**Reactive oxygen species (ROS)** Chemically reactive molecules containing oxygen

that can be generated in cells as by-products of normal cellular metabolism, and
at high levels, can cause oxidative stress and damage to cells, proteins, and DNA,
potentially contributing to various diseases and aging processes.

**Steroidogenesis** Steroidogenesis refers to the process of synthesis and production

of steroid hormones in the body. Steroid hormones are a class of lipid molecules
derived from cholesterol and include hormones such as cortisol, aldosterone,
progesterone, oestrogen, and testosterone.
**Trans fatty acids** Unhealthy fatty acids containing at least one double bond in the

trans configuration that are produced primarily when vegetable oil is hydrogenated to increase its plasticity and chemical stability for further food processing.
**Varicocele** Condition where the veins in the scrotum become enlarged and twisted,

potentially leading to testicular discomfort and impaired fertility.

###### **1 Introduction**

Nutrition is the study of how food affects the body and is a key component of human
growth. To sustain life, cells and organisms need to be adequately supplied with
vitamins, minerals, fibre, water, carbohydrates, proteins, and other micronutrients.
Some basic functions of essential nutrients are mentioned in Table 11.2. Malnutrition
is defined by the World Health Organization as the cellular mismatch between the
body’s supply of nutrients and energy and its need for them to support development,
maintenance, and certain functions. It is crucial to comprehend the significance that
diet plays in suboptimal health (Yassine et al. 2021). Nutrition is complex and seeming getting more complicated. Most of consumers are familiar with only “essential
nutrients” e.g., minerals and vitamins and more recently protein and important
amino acids. These essential nutrients have reference values, referred to as dietary
reference intakes developed by consensus committees of scientific experts convened
by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, Medicine and
Engineering and carried out by the Food and Nutrition Board (Lupton et al. 2016).
The maintenance of health and well-being, lowering the risk of sickness and
injury and improving performance all depend on an adequate diet. A variety of variables, including age, gender, body mass, height, and demands for growth and development, have an impact on the dietary requirements of each person. Suboptimal

health status (SHS), also known as subhealth, is a condition that exhibits certain
alterations in psychological behaviors, physical traits, or some medical examination
indices but lacks the typical pathologic signs. It is regarded as a therapeutic working
idea that identifies a stage between health and sickness. Definitions of some related
terms used in this chapter are mentioned in Table 11.1. The early identification of

**Table 11.1** Definition of some related terms

|Terms|Definition|Reference|
|---|---|---|
|Diet|Diet is defined as the total quantity of food a human or different creature consumes. The term “diet” frequently denotes the utilization of a certain intake of nutrients for weight or health control determinations.|Goswami et al. (2017)|
|Dietary nutrients|The nutrients are defined as the chemical composites in food which are used by the body for the maintenance of function and health properly. The dietary nutrients are important as it protects you against many non-communicable diseases which are chronic, such as cancer, diabetes and also disease related to heart. The major nutrients are proteins, vitamins, carbohydrates, fats, fiber, minerals, and water.|Beal et al. (2021)|
|Dietary supplements|These are the manufactured good meant to be occupied as a tablet, capsule, pill, liquid, or powder in order to supplement diet. The supplement can provide nutrients that are either synthetic or extracted from various food sources in order to increase their consumption.|Nesheim (1999)|
|Balanced diet|Every essential vitamin that the body requires is part of a balanced diet. Among other things, a well-balanced diet should contain vitamins, carbohydrates, minerals, fats, proteins, water, and fibre. In essence, a balanced diet lowers the risk of disease and enhances general health.|Goswami et al. (2017)|
|Suboptimal health status|SHS, also known as subhealth, is a condition that exhibits certain alterations in psychological behaviors, physical traits, or some medical examination indices but lacks the typical pathologic signs. It is regarded as a therapeutic working idea that identifies a stage between health and sickness.|Li et al. (2013)|
|Nutraceuticals|Nutraceuticals are “any substance that is a food or a component of a food that delivers medicinal and/or health advantages, including disease prevention and treatment”.|Roberfroid (2000)|
|Functional foods|Functional foods are defined as “food that seems similar to traditional food and is meant to be taken as part of a regular diet, but has been changed to perform physiological tasks beyond the provision of simple nutritional requirements”.|Spence (2006)|
|Nutritional assessment|Nutritional assessment is a diagnostic procedure carried out by the competent nutrition-trained healthcare professionals such as deititians, specialized nutrition nurses, and medical personnel. Nutritional assessment determines nutritional state and needs of patient as well as potential nutritional hazards including malnutrition.|Ferrie (2020)|
|Biomarkers|These are the “cellular, biochemical or molecular alterations that are measurable in biological media such as human tissues, cells, or fluids”. Some basic types of biomarkers are shown in Fig. 11.2.|Mayeux (2004)|

11 Nutraceuticals and Suboptimal Health: The Relationship and Significance


307


SHS creates a window opportunity for the predictive, preventive, and personalized
medicine (PPPM) in chronic diseases (Chen et al. 2014). The understanding about
the relationship between dietary nutrients and supplements with respect to suboptimal health i.e., physical, mental as well as spiritual health is evolving.
###### **2 Related Terms**

Various terms viz. dietary nutrients/supplements, functional foods, nutraceuticals
etc. are used intermittently in relevant literature. Therefore, definitions of all such
terms are mentioned in Table 11.1 for proper understanding. **3 Assessment of Dietary Nutrients**

A healthy diet can maintain and improve optimal health. A high consumption of the
legumes, seeds or nuts, fruits, vegetables, fish, cereals and a low intake of meat and
dairy goods characterize a healthy quality diet, while sugary drinks, a high salt
intake, and red meat are signs of a morbid quality of diet. Classification and some
food sources of nutrient is shown in Fig. 11.1. Optimal health can include aspects of
mental, physical as well as spiritual health (Echouffo-Tcheugui and Ahima 2019).

**3.1.1 Declined Food Intake with Age**


A. Thakur et al.


It is also known as “Anorexia of Aging” It is an important health problem and highly
prevalent among older adults. It leads to negative health outcomes such as malnutrition, weight loss, sarcopenia, physical frailty and changes in composition. The onset
of cachexia with muscular wasting, which is linked to high rates of mortality and
morbidity, is also influenced by it. A reduction in food consumption is an uncommon and difficult component of ageing. Along with physiological changes brought
on by ageing, age-related diseases, and other causes, emotional, social, and environmental factors may also have a big influence on eating habits, food consumption,
and functional status (Plotkin and Taani 2020).

**3.1.2 Tooth Loss**

Diet is a crucial part to living a healthy life since it plays a part in the genesis and,
therefore, prevention of many chronic illnesses, including cardiovascular disease,
cancer, diabetes, and obesity. Nutrient consumption and tooth loss are closely
related (Arora et al. 2019a). The major purpose of teeth is mastication, which takes
place mostly in the oral cavity. Loss of teeth affects masticatory function and chewing abilities, which might diminish the range and number of foods one can choose
from. Due to these factors, food consumption been seen as a link between a number
of chronic diet-related disorders and tooth retention (Gaewkhiew et al. 2017).

**3.1.3 Maternal Under-Nutrition**

The insufficient intake of nutrients, which are crucial during pregnancy, contributes
to poor development in addition to a lack of protein and energy. For the initial
implantation of pregnancy-related tissue and to sustain new tissue, pregnant women
require more protein. Due to increased maternal metabolic needs, increased erythropoiesis has, a building of maternal tissue reserves, and foetal requirements for
growth and development, micronutrient requirements rise during pregnancy. Due to
starting pregnancy with vitamin deficits or depleted stocks, low dietary intakes during pregnancy, and other factors, women in resource-poor nations are more at risk
for micronutrient deficiencies during pregnancy (Tsegaye et al. 2017).

**3.1.4 Tongue Pressure**

The suboptimal pressure of tongue is related to the hazard of the malnutrition in the
community dwelling elder people. Older persons with poor tongue pressure should
have their nutritional condition and swallowing function evaluated thoroughly to

detect subclinical malnutrition and dysphagia early. The tongue is vital in swallowing, and its failure might hypothetically lead to insufficient oral intake and eventual
malnutrition (Chang et al. 2021).
###### **4 Essential Nutrients for Maintenance of Suboptimal Health**

The physiological and biochemical progression through which an organism takes
food to sustain its existence is termed as nutrition. It gives nutrients to organisms,
which can be digested to produce chemical structures and energy. The deficiency of
nutrients, also known as malnutrition, it occurs when an organism does not have the
quantity of nutrients that it needs for good health. This may be caused as the insufficient nutrients are absorbed or there is a sudden loose of nutrients. An organism
will adapt in this situation by reducing its energy intake and output in order to maximize the use of nutrients that have been conserved. It will initially use stored energy
before destroying its own body mass to get additional energy. Thus, nutrients are
essential for the maintenance of suboptimal health (Bender 2002).

Nutrients are complex organic or inorganic compounds found in the diet. There
are around 50 distinct nutrients that are generally given by the food which we intake.
Some basic functions of essential nutrients are mentioned in Table 11.2. Each nutri
ent has a distinct purpose in the body. Most natural foods include many nutrients
(Arora and Baldi 2017a). Essential nutrients are the chemicals that the body doesn’t
or can’t produce in suitable quantities. The requirements of these nutrient are fulfilled by the other sources of food as per the WHO, and they are essential for disease
prevention, growth, and well health (Goswami et al. 2017).

**Table 11.2** Basic functions of some essential nutrients

|Nutrients|Function|Reference|
|---|---|---|
|Protein|It is necessary for cell reparation and hormone, enzyme production, and formation of tissue. Protein is vital for building a health of the immune system and strong muscles.|Erickson and Kim (1990)|
|Carbohydrate|Carbohydrate provides good energy source for human body as well as basic elements for the creation of cells.|Stephen et al. (2012)|
|Fat|It provides reservoir of energy for the functioning of body as basic component of cells, and signals molecules for the appropriate communication of cells. It works to maintain body temperature and provides insulation to vital organs.|Ananthakrishnan et al. (2014)|
|Vitamin|It promotes or regulates the normal functions of body systems and functions the body processes.|Maqbool et al. (2018)|
|Mineral|It regulates the body processes, which are vital for the proper cellular function, and comprised of tissues.|Majewski et al. (2016)|
|Water|It transports essential nutrients to every point of body, aids with the maintenance of body temperature and remove waste products for disposal.|Boyd (2019)|

###### ***4.1 Micronutrients***


A. Thakur et al.


These are vitamin and mineral supplements. These are called as micronutrients as
they are essential in tiny amounts ranging from a fraction of a milligrams to several
grams (Alloway 2008).
Example: iron, cobalt, chromium, iodine, copper, zinc and molybdenum etc.
###### ***4.2 Macronutrients***

These are also known as “proximate principles” of food as they make up the majority of diet. They contribute to total calorie consumption in the following percentage
in the Indian diet (Macdonald 1999) *.*

Examples are carbohydrates (65–80%), protein (7–15%) and fat (10–30%).
The essential nutrients and their function for the maintenance of suboptimal
health are discussed below: ***4.3 Vitamins***

Vitamins are the chemicals, organic in nature which are classified in two classes on
the bases of their solubility nature such as soluble in fat or either soluble in water.
Vitamins which are fat soluble like as vitamin-A, vitamin-D, vitamin-E and vitamin-­K get dissolved in fat tends to gather in the body. Vitamins which are water
soluble like as vit-B and C complex vitamins such as vit-B 12, vit-B 6 and folate must
get dissolved into the water before they get absorbed by the body, and therefore cannot be stored. Basic function of vitamins is given in Table 11.2. Any water-soluble
vitamin which is not utilized by the body is lost primarily through the urine
(Maqbool et al. 2018). ***4.4 Minerals***

Minerals are the in-organic elements extant in water and soil, and consumed by
animals or absorbed by plants (Arora et al. 2013). Basic function of minerals is
mentioned in Table 11.2. Some minerals like as Ca, Na and K including number of
other trace minerals (like as Zn, Cu and iodine) needed in very minor amounts for
the maintenance of health (Majewski et al. 2016).

###### ***4.5 Protein***


311


[Proteins are the large macromolecules and biomolecules that includes one or more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomolecule)
[long chains of including catalyzing metabolic related reactions, DNA replication,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_catalysis)
[transportation of molecules from one location to another, responding to stimuli, and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular_transport)
[providing structure to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoskeleton) [organisms and cells. Proteins are differed from one another in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrous_protein)
their amino-acid sequence, which is known by the nucleotide sequence of their
genes. Basic function of proteins is mentioned in Table 11.2. This causes proteins to
typically fold into a certain three-dimensional structure, which controls the function
of the protein (Erickson and Kim 1990).
###### ***4.6 Fats***

Along with amino acid residues, fats are one of the three major macronutrient categories in the human diet. These are the primary building blocks of everyday foods
including cooking oils milk, tallow, butter, salt pork and lard together with proteins
and carbohydrate. Fats carry out a wide range of tasks inside organisms and serve
vital metabolic and structural roles in most of the living things including thermal
insulation, waterproofing. These are the primary source of energy for several animals. Except for a few necessary fatty acids that must consume by the human is able
to synthesize the fat, which it needs from other dietary elements. Basic function of
fats is mentioned in Table 11.2. Several water-insoluble vitamins, compounds of
fragrance, and flavorings are transported by dietary fats (Ananthakrishnan
et al. 2014). ***4.7 Water***

Water is an inorganic chemical, that is clear, flavorless, odorless, and almost colorless. It is the primary component of the hydrosphere of the earth. Despite not supplying food, organic micronutrients, or energy. For all currently understood forms
of life, it is necessary. Basic function of water is mentioned in Table 11.2. Its molecules having chemical formula H 2 O and are composed of two hydrogen atoms
bound together by covalent bonds and the H and O atoms are linked at an angle of
104.45° (Boyd 2019). ***4.8 Carbohydrates***

Carbohydrates are the moieties of sugar. It is also one of the major nutrients which
is found in foods and drinks. The carbohydrates were breaks down into the glucose
by human body, which is the major source of energy for tissues, organs, and cells of

human body. Basic function of carbohydrates is mentioned in Table 11.2. Glucose
can be stored or used immediately in the muscles and liver for its later use (Stephen
et al. 2012).
###### **5 Biomarkers**

It is well known by the name of biological markers. Free radical biologists have
used the word “biomarker”from molecular epidemiology to characterize a molecular alteration in a biological molecule caused by reactive halide species, nitrogen, or
oxygen. It is equally applicable to DNA, lipids, proteins, and antioxidant consumption products, where the kind of reaction may be direct addition, abstraction of
proton, or transfer of electron (Griffiths et al. 2002). Biomarkers are the “cellular,
biochemical or molecular alterations that are measurable in biological media such
as human tissues, cells, or fluids”. The concept has lately been expanded to encompass biological traits that may be empirically examined and assessed as a sign of
healthy pharmacological, pathogenic, and biological reactions to the therapeutic
intervention (Mayeux 2004).

Clinical biomarkers come under predictive bio-markers and have the advantages
of being repeatable and able to be studied over a shorter time period. These are also
less expensive and easier to monitor than last clinical end-points. Some basic types
of biomarkers are shown in Fig. 11.2. For example, collecting a patient’s blood pressure is far easier than using echocardiogram to test left ventricular function, and
echocardiography is much easier than measuring morbidity and death from hypertension in the long run. Whereas blood pressure may be monitored instantly and
often, collecting data on morbidity and death takes years (Aronson and Ferner 2017).

Currently, biomarkers are used in nutrition, and health care & research aim to
quantify disease onset and progression. However, both nutrition and health care
should focus on the maintenance of optimal health, where the underlying biology
differs significantly from the biomedical science. Health is defined by the ability to
continuously adapt in different conditions involving many mechanisms of system
flexibility. A novel generation of biomarkers that quantify all aspects of system flexibility is required, it opens the way for true lifestyle-related optimization of health,
self-empowerment, and related products and services (Zeisel and da Costa 2009). ***5.1 Alliance Between biomarkers and Supplement Intake***

Objectively measured nutritional biomarkers can help to confirm self-reported
nutrient consumption by indicating the internal dosage or absorption. Biological
markers may be affected by a several factors, however, with regard to the supplements as a source for intake of nutrients. Firstly, a larger spectrum of nutrients may
be consumed, and various dose-response relationships can be found when

**Fig. 11.2** Types of biomarkers


313


comparing total nutrient intake (TNI) to food-sourced intake alone. Secondly,
although a dose-response connection is different and some of these results may be
contradictory with reference to the “internal dosage”. At last, collinearity in supplement nutrient consumption exists, just as meals include many nutrients that may
interact (for example fat-soluble vitamins as antioxidants in high-fat diets) (e.g., use
of multivitamin/multimineral-type supplements). Consequently, biomarkers outside
of the nutrients investigated may be impacted (Lentjes 2019).

Some of the major studies related to the relationship between supplement intake
and biomarkers is discusses below:

- ***Dai et al.*** (2022) studied the association of biomarker and intake of α- linolenic

acid with incident Colorectal Cancer (CRC). CRC is now the fourth most deadly
disease in the world, causing around 900,000 deaths annually. It is the third most
common in males and the second most frequent cancer diagnosed in women

A. Thakur et al.


(Dekker et al. 2019). Dietary variables have been proven to have a significant
influence in CRC prevention. The biological mechanisms underlying the anticancer effects of alpha-linolenic acid, including the suppression of nuclear factor-­B (NF-B), the activation of AMPK/SIRT1, the modulation of cyclooxygenase
activity, and the upregulation of novel anti-inflammatory lipid mediators such as
protectins, maresins, and resol, were demonstrated at the cellular and animal
model levels. Alpha-linolenic acid, as a plant-based member of n-3 PUFAs, can
be derived from vegetable oils. It was analyzed that the incidence of CRC was
negatively correlated with ALA biomarkers, and the risk of CRC decreased by
10% for every 0.1% increase in circulating ALA levels. The risk of CRC may be
reduced by promoting the consumption of foods high in ALA to increase its
levels in the blood. However, for better outcomes, well-designed, large-scale
cohorts with biomarkers are still required.

- ***Wang et al.*** (2022) studied the association of the intake of cobalamin and related

biomarkers with the hazard of mortality amongst adults with second type of diabetes in a nutrition examination. Cobalamin (Vit-B 12 ) is an important vitamin
that functions as a co-enzyme in the metabolism of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid (MMA). Cobalamin insufficiency and diabetes are biologically related,
according to a growing body of studies, which is partially explained by oxidative
damage and insulin resistance. To estimate the 95% of confidence intervals and
hazard ratios for hazards of mortality, weighted Cox proportional risks regression was employed. It was determined that neither blood cobalamin nor dietary
cobalamin are linked to decreased mortality. Reduced cobalamin sensitivity was
strongly linked to cardiac and all-cause mortality, especially among metformin

nonusers.

- ***Fallah et al.*** (2022) studied the association of liver biomarkers in adults with the

consumption of green tea, which is the mostly consumes beverage in the world
after the water and formed by using the leaves of plant known as Camellia sinensis, and its supplements. Green tea includes beneficial compounds called polyphenols, primarily catechins, which account for not less than 15% of the dried
green tea leaves. Green tea extracts (GTEs) have been developed and added to
dietary supplements, foods, and beverages due to the association in between the
usage of green tea and advantageous health effects, such as weight loss, improved
lipid metabolism, neuro-protective effects, and the improvements in the chronic
conditions. Green tea drinking was shown to be related with a lower risk of
­having abnormal liver biomarkers, but no meaningful connection with the usage
of supplements was found.

- ***Conley et al.*** (2022) studied the relation between biomarkers and dietary phos
phate intake of the bone and material metabolism. An estimated 10% of individuals globally are thought to have a chronic kidney disease (CKD), and its incidence
is steadily increasing. People with CKD are more likely to get heart problems
(CVD). The development of the CVD risk linked to chronic kidney disease
(CKD) may be significantly influenced by the abnormalities of mineral metabolism and bone, including the hyper-phosphatemia and hyper-parathyroidism
(CKD-MBD). According to dietary food records, total dietary phosphate con

sumption levels do not substantially correspond with either biochemical markers
of the bone and intermediate cardio-vascular or mineral metabolism indicators.

- ***Pitts et al.*** (2022) studied the pressure-mediated reflection spectroscopy criterion

validity as a biological marker of vegetable and fruit intake. According to the US
Dietary Guidelines for 2020–2025, 2 and 2.5 cups of fruits and vegetables
respectively daily-focusing on orange, red, and green vegetables are necessary
for good health. An inadequate intake of vegetables & fruits is linked to an
increase the hazard of metabolic syndrome, diabetes, heart related disease, obesity and cancer. Overall, Americans drink fewer FVs than they should, and this is
especially true in underprivileged communities. It was concluded that skin carotenoids which are assessed by spectroscopy may be rational alternative of the
measurement of plasma carotenoids.

- ***Mates et al.*** (2022) reviewed the walnut intake targeting biomarkers of the meta
bolic syndrome and inflammation in over the age of adults. The walnut is
regarded as a nutraceutical’s food source due to their high level of healthy fatty
acids, like as omega-3 PUFA & MUFA, nutritional value, strong antioxidant
phytochemical content, and health benefits. MetS (Age-related metabolic syndrome) conditions, inflammation, chronic, and the oxidative stress are all important risk factors for morbidity and mortality. These pathophysiological factors
raise the risk of age-related illnesses like cancer, dementia, cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes (T2D), and cognitive decline. It was discovered that walnut
intake significantly improved the lipid profiles in middle-aged and older persons
when compared to various control diets.
###### **6 Role of Various Microorganisms in Improving ** **Suboptimal Health**

The role of various microorganisms in the maintenance of suboptimal health status
is discussed below: ***6.1 Microbiota and Probiotics***

Microbiota has an essential role in multiple body functions, including physiological, immunological, and metabolic processes, via various mechanisms like as the
regulated growth and functioning of several categories of the immune cells in gut.
Bacteria over the mucosal surface or within the mucus layer interact with the human
immune system; hence, an healthy gut microbiota is required for the growth of
mucosal immunity (D’Angelo et al. 2017).

Probiotics are a mixture of live bacteria or yeast that lives in your body in order
to maintain the human body health (Baldi 2018a). The intake of the probiotics can


-----

316


A. Thakur et al.


lower the hazard of ailments related with the dysfunction in intestinal barrier dysfunction (Baldi 2018b; Arora et al. 2019b). The methods by which the probiotics
alter barrier function have revealed that probiotics boost barrier function by increasing anti-microbial peptides, mucus and production of secretory IgA, as well as
enhancing viable adherence for pathogens and epithelial cell tight junction (TJ)
integrity (Arora and Baldi 2017b). Certain lactobacilli are known to stick to mucosal surfaces, limiting harmful bacteria adhesion and increasing mucin production
(Rao and Samak 2013).
###### ***6.2 Gut Microbiota and Vitamin***

Obesity progression and maintenance are influenced by a variety of variables,
including systemic substandard inflammation, adipose tissue malfunction, and gut
microbial dysbiosis. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in the function of
vitamins in the obesity and associated illnesses, both at gut and host bacterial levels.
Vitamins are the mostly obtained from food, although some, particularly those in
the K and B families, can be produced by the gut bacterial environment and absorbed
in the colon (Arora et al. 2019c). It is critical to closely monitor the vitamin status
of patients with the obesity and perhaps pre-existing comorbidities, and also to scrutinize the dysbiotic gut microbiota and hence potentially changed vitamin bacterial
metabolism. This is due to the fact that vitamin shortage can change several critical
cellular activities, resulting in major health problems (Voland et al. 2022). ***6.3 Acidifiers***

Organic acids, often known as acidifiers, play a crucial function in animal intestinal
health. Acidifiers can be utilized to modify the intestinal microbial populations and
boost response of immune, acting similarly to the antibiotics in the food of animals
by combating harmful bacteria. The acidifiers are also promoting mineral absorption and improve nutrient digestion. The inclusion of organic acids also causes the
intestinal lining to thin, allowing for greater nutrient absorption and utilization.
Their impact will not be the same for all organic acids since their mode of action is
determined by their pKa value. Acidifiers in feed decrease pathogenic bacterial
development and reduce microbial competition for host resources by affecting the
pH (Pearlin et al. 2020).

**6.3.1 Function of the Acidifiers in the Nutrition**

- Effect of the organic acid on mineral utilization and nutrient digestion.

- Improved production and performance of nutrition.


-----

11 Nutraceuticals and Suboptimal Health: The Relationship and Significance

- Positive impact of acidifiers on immunity.

- Assistance in intermediary metabolism.

- Preservation of feedstuffs.

- pH maintenance.

- Control on pathogenic microbes.

- Facilitative absorption of nutrients.

**6.3.2 Factors Influencing the Efficacy of Acidifiers**


317


Despite of our growing understanding of the various ways that acidifiers work in
animal nutrition, there are still a few things that need to be deduced. Some of the
attributes that are connected to dietary, animal, or acid factors have led to some
contradictory results. The inclusion level, the molecular weight, the nature of chemical (salt, acid, uncoated or coated), the minimum inhibitory concentration of the
acid, the pKa values of acids, the types of species, microorganisms and their concentration, the site of action, the buffering ability of feed, the dietary composition
and the species of animal must be included (Pearlin et al. 2020).
###### ***6.4 Microbial Metabolites***

The microbial population that exists in the synergistic relationship with the host and
is widely distributed throughout the human gastro-intestinal tract is essential to preserving cellular homeostasis. They collectively make up the microbiome. A host
may develop a variety of illnesses as a result of changes in the gut microbiota’s
composition and disturbances in the synergy between the host and microbiome.
These involves inflammatory, metabolic and neurological illnesses (Singh 2022). ***6.5 Live Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus***

Immunodeficiency is a fairly frequent condition in which people with poor health
and numerous illnesses are being developed or treated. Probiotics have recently
emerged as a crucial tool for immunological control (Arora et al. 2019c; Voland
et al. 2022). The mechanisms of interactions between immune deficiency and the
gut microbiota are receiving more and more attention. The combination of *live*
*Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus* and *Enterococcus* has an immunomodulatory effect
(Lv et al. 2021).


-----

318
###### ***6.6 Feed Enzymes***


A. Thakur et al.


The health of the gut is based on the effective evolution of the intestine’s absorptive
capacity, which is regulated by the co-evolution of the intestinal immune systems
and the microbiota. In this process, availability of nutrient is important, from the
standpoint of the microbiota, this alters with age as the intestines and upper gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbes become more effective at removing nutrients. The
feeding of the enzymes is important in this process. The presence of the nutrients in
the lower region of the intestines for microbiota can be decreased by the use of
phytases, which can enhance the digestion of the energy, minerals, and amino acids.
With regard to amino acid delivery, protease can have a similar impact. Non-starch
polysaccharidases play a special role in which they release fibre fragments from the
insoluble matrix into the minor and more fermentable fractions of the carbohydrates. By improving diet digestibility from the host’s perspective, these agents limits the amount of nutrients available to the microbiota (Bedford and Apajalahti 2022).
###### **7 Role of Dietary Nutrients in Various Health Conditions ** **for Maintaining Suboptimal Health Status**

It is critical to understand the influence of nutrients, not only in the context of a
dietary pattern but also with the separation, which is a complex mixture of the nutrients mainly in the health conditions. Some basic functions of essential nutrients are
mentioned in Table 11.2. The role of dietary nutrients in several health conditions
for the maintenance of the suboptimal health is discussed below: ***7.1 Osteoporosis and Related Nutrient***

Osteoporosis is the chronic disease that causes a reduction in the mineral density of
bone, increased hazard of fragility fractures and a decreased strength of bone.
Fragility fractures cause significant mortality, disability and morbidity, and are a
key public health issue around the world. Calcium and Vit-D intake status are considered essential for the bone metabolism homeostasis and maintenance of suboptimal health. Promoting healthy habits is critical for lowering the risk of osteoporosis.
The dietary intake of protein, calcium, and vit-D into adequate quantity in the diet,
as well as getting regular exercise with weight and giving up bad behaviors like
smoking and drinking, all help to improve bone quality (Muñoz-garach et al. 2020).


-----

11 Nutraceuticals and Suboptimal Health: The Relationship and Significance

**7.1.1 Dairy Products, Calcium and Vit-D**


319


Vitamin D and calcium form part of the mineral matrix as calcium phosphate are
required for the strength of bone. The adherence to the healthy diet is the finest way
to achieve the adequate calcium intake. The most important sources of the calcium
in the diet are dairy products (cheese, yogurt and milk), fish (mainly sardines with
the bones), pulses and a some of the fruits and vegetables (particularly seeds and
nuts) (Chiodini and Bolland 2018).

The main regulator of calcium homeostasis is vitamin D. A small variety of
foods, including fatty fish, mushrooms, as well as some fortified dairy products,
provide 10–20% of the vitamin D that is consumed, with the remaining 80–90%
coming through cutaneous synthesis following exposure to sunshine. Vitamin D is
necessary to preserve bone health, strength, and the muscular mass (Hayes
et al. 2016).

Calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium, which have morphological roles in the
proper development of bones, are minerals that are mostly found in dairy products.
Protein, potassium, zinc, riboflavin and vitamin B 12 are additional nutrients found in
dairy products. Dairy products are a fantastic source of vitamin D. The vitamin D
deficiency may be prevented and treated by getting enough sun exposure. The shortage vitamin D has negative effects on health outcomes, and crucial for maintaining
health of bone. Osteoporosis may worsen in older or post-menopausal women who
are vitamin D deficient (Adami et al. 2009).

**7.1.2 Minerals**

Magnesium and potassium are two minerals that are crucial for healthy bones.
Potassium in the diet may lessen the strain and, consequently, the loss of calcium
from the bones. Along with maintaining the body’s alkaline condition, potassium
can also lead to an increase in the body’s calcium resorption (Kong et al. 2017). The
metabolism of calcium also depends on magnesium. With an average body concentration of 10–30 mm, magnesium is the second most predominant intracellular cation after potassium. The majority of entire foods, including legumes, nuts, and
green leafy vegetables, contain magnesium. For males and women, the recommended daily intakes of magnesium are 400–420 mg and 310–360 mcg, respectively (Arora and Baldi 2015a). Based on their age, sex, and past nutritional
condition, different people have different needs. Magnesium is necessary for muscular contractions, brain function, and the exchange of potassium and calcium ions
throughout the membranes of cells (Institute of Medicine (US) Standing Committee
on the Scientific Evaluation of Dietary Reference Intakes 1997).

320

**7.1.3 Protein**


A. Thakur et al.


The consumption of protein is essential for the maintenance of health of bone.
Proteins make up roughly one-third of bone mass and nearly half of bone volume.
As the mineralization takes place, these bio-blocks become a component of the collagen structure and are merged into the organic matrix of bone. Furthermore, dietary
proteins have an impact on the production and activity of IGF-I, an orthotropic
hormone vital for bone development. The IGF-I hormone increases the rate of the
reabsorption of phosphate from the kidney and enhances absorption of phosphorus
and calcium in the gut. Protein is also involved in the conception of calcitriol. Eggs,
fish, meat, poultry, and dairy goods are the key protein sources in healthy diets. For
the synthesis and preservation of bone matrix, enough protein consumption is
essential (Rizzoli et al. 2014).

Fruits and vegetables provide abundant sources of the nutrients needed for strong
bones, including magnesium and potassium as well as vitamins C, carotenoids, vitamin K, and folate (Ahmadieh and Arabi 2011).

**7.1.4 Vitamin C and K**

The mineralization process during which bone matrix is formed involves vitamin
K. It affects other vitamin K-dependent proteins as well as the carboxylase-­
microsomal, which helps with the post-translational conversion of glutamyl into
carboxy-glutamyl residues in the osteocalcin. Vitamin K is made up of a family of
various molecular forms, with vitamin K 1 being a single form which is produced by
plants and vitamin K 2 being a family of many forms, mostly produced by the bacteria. The main form of vitamin K 1 consumed by humans is type-I. The presence of
vitamin K 2 in the cheese is a unique characteristic (Veronese et al. 2015).

Because of its characteristics of antioxidant, vitamin C can help with the bone
health. It has the capacity to reduce osteoclast activity. Also, it contributes to the
production of collagen and serves as a co-factor for osteoblast differentiation.
Vitamin C is a sign of a balanced diet high in vegetables and fruits (Finck et al. 2014).

**7.1.5 Fatty Acids (Omega-3 Polyunsaturated) and Some Other Nutrients**

The influence of the omega-3 polyunsaturated on the metabolism of bones is a subject of contradictory research. Docosahexaenoic acid and eicosatetraenoic acid
ingestion may have an impact on bone development and remodeling in the humans
by preventing resorption of bone as well as by promoting formation of bone (Griel
et al. 2007). Although the exact method by which the PUFAs may alter turnover of
bone is unknown, it is speculated that both EPA and DHA may benefit by controlling the ratio of receptor activator with a balance toward bone production (Sun
et al. 2003).

###### ***7.2 Pulmonary Tuberculosis***


321


Pulmonary tuberculosis termed as TB is a serious contamination which is caused by
the *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (MTB) that includes the respiratory system, lungs
and may spread to other organs. TB can also cause malnutrition. Micronutrient deficiencies and protein-energy malnutrition leads to immuno-deficiency as a result of
poor nutrition. This secondary immunodeficiency makes the host more susceptible
to the infection and, as a result, increases the hazard of emerging tuberculosis which
origins the nutrient malabsorption, appetite loss, altered metabolism, and micronutrient malabsorption, resulting in poor nutritional status. During antituberculosis
treatment, the nutritional status of patients and dietary intake improve, which helps
to maintain their nutritional or suboptimal health status (Kant et al. 2015). Nutritional
status may influence relapse of active tuberculosis. Along with the nutritional depletion and weight loss are common in tuberculosis patients at the period of diagnosis.
The role of several dietary nutrients in pulmonary tuberculosis for maintaining suboptimal health status is discussed below:

**7.2.1 Micro-nutrients**

Because of their various metabolic properties and functions, micronutrients have
been recognized as an essential component for optimal human health. The most
common causes of secondary immunodeficiency are micronutrient deficiencies and
morbidity from infection, including tuberculosis. All of the vitamins that is vitamin­A, vitamin-B 6, vitamin-E, vitamin-C, and folic acid as well as the other minerals
like as zinc, selenium, iron and copper plays an important function in cellular function, metabolic pathways, and immune competence (Karyadi et al. 2000).

**7.2.2 Vitamin A**

In tuberculosis, vitamin A has an immunocompetent activity as it prevents pathogenic
bacilli from multiplying in cultured human macrophages (Chandra 1991). It is often
measured using serum retinol and also plays a significant role in antibody response
production, mucosal surface maintenance, epithelial function, and lymphocyte proliferation (Semba 1998). It is essential for the normal functioning of macrophage activity, B and T lymphocytes and generation of antibody response (Mugusi et al. 2003).

**7.2.3 Vitamin D**

Vitamin D is essential for activation macrophages, which is required to keep tuberculosis dormant. Furthermore, vitamin D inhibits the transcription of a substance
required for the intracellular survival of tuberculosis bacillus in macrophages, which

contain the bacilli. The deficiency of vitamin D allows the progress of disease to the
active form (Ustianowski et al. 2005).

**7.2.4 Vitamin E**

The level of vitamin E in the blood is significantly lower in tuberculosis patients.
Non-enzymic antioxidants such as reduced glutathione and vitamin E were significantly depleted in the plasma of pulmonary tuberculosis patients (Bakaev and
Duntau 2004).

**7.2.5 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid**

Tuberculosis is linked to omega-3. The eicosanoid production in the macrophages
was investigated, and the conclusions revealed that dietary supplementation with
eicosapentaenoic acid, n-3 fatty acids, and docosahexaenoic acid can affect the
resistance to the *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, while n-6 fatty acids did not *(* Zent
and Smith 1995 *).*
###### ***7.3 Heart Disease, Diabetes, Influenza and Pneumonia***

The world population is undergoing a demographic change, with the share of elderly
individuals (aged 65 and up) increasing faster than individual of any other age. This
age group is more likely to acquire chronic illnesses related to nutrition such diabetes, cardiovascular disease, influenza, and pneumonia. Inappropriately, due to systemic healthcare, biological, and environmental complications, insufficient
nutritional insufficiency, often known as hidden hunger which disproportionately
affects older persons. Hidden hunger refers to people, who consume enough calories but receive insufficient micronutrients, placing them at the risk for diseases
related to nutrition. Over time, inadequate dietary consumption of macro-nutrients
and micro-nutrients can have a detrimental impact on the health outcomes, potentially leading to a cycle of suboptimal health (Eggersdorfer et al. 2018).

The lifespan of individual is determined by both intrinsic (such as genetic) and
extrinsic (such as lifestyle, nutrition, and environment) factors. Physiological dysregulation, particularly in the immune system, is a key alteration that happens in
older persons (Bailey and Arab 2012). Aging can cause inflammation, diminish
innate immune response, and decrease T cell-mediated activity. Low level of nutrition is the vital hazard factor for the emergence of chronic and infectious illnesses,
as well as impaired cognitive function, all of which have serious consequences for
quality of life and survival. Increased intake of particular nutrients, dietary patterns,
and food that promote healthy ageing, on the other hand, may diminish the hazard

or postpone the onset of a several varieties of the chronic illnesses, as well as having
a positive impact on health span (Who and Consultation 2003).

**7.3.1 Protein**

Maintaining lean mass (LM) is crucial since muscle mass normally declines with
ageing and increases the risk of falls in older persons. The highest protein intake
quintile of community-dwelling women and men (70–80-year-old) lost 40% less
lean mass over time than those in the lowest quintile, according to the aging, health,
and body study, which came to the conclusion that the dietary protein intake may be
an adjustable risk associated factor for the sarcopenia. The Current Institute of
Medicine (CIM) protein consumption guidelines apply to adults of all ages.
However, it has been indicated that older persons may require an essential protein
consumption to maintain the nitrogen balance and counteract the reduced insulin
action and lower protein synthesis efficiency that occur with age and avoid muscle
mass loss (Nowson and O’Connell 2015).

**7.3.2 Omega-3**

Dietary fibre is essential for proper digestive health. Obesity, bowel inflammatory
disease, auto-immune arthritis, and the metabolic syndrome have all been linked to
an unhealthy gut microbiota and infectious and degenerative illnesses (Zapata and
Quagliarello 2015). Due to the extremely low consumption of fibre in diets, fibre
has been designated as the “nutrient of public health concern” (Goldszmid and
Trinchieri 2012).

**7.3.3 Vitamin B: Folate, B** **6** **and B** **12**

Vitamin B are necessary for a variety of biological functions, such as healthy nerve
and immune systems and bones. Folate inhibits hyperhomocysteinemia, which is
linked to endothelial dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, and is
required for DNA methylation. With ageing, vitamin B 12 absorption becomes less
effective, increasing the risk of deficiencies, which might have serious effects given
the vitamin’s involvement in cell growth and mental function. Animal protein consumption affects how much vitamin B 12 is consumed, and since inadequate stomach
acid affects how much of it is absorbed, a deficit may also arise with the extended
usage of acid hindering drugs. The immune system and homocysteine concentration
are linked by vitamin B 6, another B vitamin that is crucial for cognition and depression. Because it is easily lost during processing of food and is not typically added
back into the food supply, vitamin B 6 is crucial for the metabolism of protein
(Eggersdorfer et al. 2018).


-----

324

**7.3.4 Vitamin D**


A. Thakur et al.


Vitamin D is vital for proper absorption of the calcium, which aids in bone mineralization and the prevention of weakness in muscle. It is a particularly significant
micronutrient for lowering the risk of fractures and osteoporosis caused by falls as
a vitamin D can only be created by UV-exposure and is scarce in food sources,
elderly people are more likely to be deficient in this vitamin because they spend
more time indoors (Eggersdorfer et al. 2018).

**7.3.5 Dietary Patterns**

The best way to reduce your risk of developing chronic illnesses is to consume a
balanced diet of whole foods, limiting your intake of processed meat, sugar, salt,
and refined grains. The examples of healthy dietary patterns like as DASH (Dietary
approaches to stop the hypertension) and the Mediterranean diet are widely used
because they maintain a decent balance of nutrients, which is necessary for maximum health. It has been demonstrated that the DASH diet, can help decrease blood
pressure (Appel et al. 1997).
###### ***7.4 Ageing***

It has been suggested that vitamin B and folate with a metabolic connection may
have preventive functions in the ageing disease (vitamins B 6, B 12, and riboflavin).
Riboflavin and folate deficiencies in elder persons are typically brought on by poor
intake of diet, whereas the low level of B 12 status is typically linked to food bounded
malabsorption and subpart vit-B 6 deficiency is explained by aging-related increases
in requirements. Because of the constantly growing elderly population, it is anticipated that the prevalence of various age-related disorders would significantly rise.
Additionally, these degenerative illnesses lead to numerous co-morbidities in elderly
individuals, which has significant social and economic repercussions. Thus health
in elder age become a top public health concern (Porter et al. 2016).

**7.4.1 Health of Brain in Ageing: Cognitive Dysfunction**

The range of cognitive abilities may gradually disappear, ranging from (MCI) to
dementia (Hedden and Gabrieli 2004). According to estimates, 50% of elderly
adults with moderate cognitive impairment will go on to acquire dementia within
the 5 years of diagnosis. The pace of cognitive loss differs across individuals. It has
been demonstrated that cognitive impairment and cognitive decline are caused by
low vitamin B 6 levels (Tucker et al. 2005).

**7.4.2 Health of Bone in Ageing**


325


The possible significance of B-vitamins and folate in bone health MTHFR 677TT
polymorphism’s possible impact on bone health may be mediated by impaired
methylation of DNA as a result of decreased DNA structure and stability. It was
suggested that individuals with the low B-vitamin status and MTHFR 677TT genotype may be most susceptible to deprived bone health in the later life (Wolffe and
Matzke 1999).

**7.4.3 Cardiovascular Health in Ageing**

Homocysteine is the major problem associated with the dietary nutrients. The
plasma homocysteine concentrations and/or low folate with an increased risk of
cognitive dysfunction. It was concluded that the risk of heart disease would reduce
by 11–16% by lowering homocysteine (Who and Consultation 2003; Nowson and
O’Connell 2015). However, homocysteine may be a marker of poor B-vitamin status and so just represent a disruption in the metabolism of single carbon instead of
the causative function in cardiovascular disease, but this is not commonly accepted
(McNulty et al. 2012).
###### ***7.5 Serum Cortisol, Psychological Stress, and Suboptimal *** ***Symptoms of Emotional and Physical Health***

The core cause of the multiple negative consequences of persistent psychological
stress is systemic inflammation and oxidative damage. All stress reactions stem
from the disturbance of some homeostatic set point, whether physical, psychological or physiological (McEwen and Wingfield 2010). Stress is linked to the
activation of the autonomic and the endocrine systems, including limbic, hypothalamus, and the brainstem circuits (Chrousos 2000). Chronic activation of these
systems can lead to stress-related diseases like depression and other anxiety disorders (Mitra and Sapolsky 2008). The effects of the macular carotenoids on cortisol, stress, and signs of poor mental and physical health are all dramatically
reduced (Stringham et al. 2018). ***7.6 Intake of Salt***

Excessive consumption of dietary salt i.e., sodium chloride is linked to an increased
hazard of the increase in blood pressure, which is the main hazardous factor for the
stroke and the other heart related disorders, along with renal disease. Besides, High

A. Thakur et al.


intake of salt or a liking for salty foods has been linked to an amplified hazard of
stomach cancer and, an enhanced hazard of the obesity. Reduced dietary salt consumption, on the other hand, leads to a significant drop in blood pressure, particularly in individuals with hypertension, albeit to a smaller extent (Rust and
Ekmekcioglu 2017). There are several studies in the context of impact of salt intake
on the treatment and pathogenesis of increased blood pressure i.e., hypertension.
For example:

***O’Donnell et al.*** (2014) suggested that a diet with lower level of salt may bears

negative health consequences, particularly in terms of cardiovascular disease and
death and;
***Mente et al.*** (2016) for instance reviewed an overtone between the low level of

sodium intake and increased hazard of cardio-vascular disease and mortality in
the both normotensive and hypertensive personalities.
###### **8 Nutrient Assessment for Suboptimal Health**

Nutritional status/Nutrient is the current status of body, of a population group or a
person, related to consumption and utilization of nutrients i.e., their state of nourishment. Some basic functions of essential nutrients are mentioned in Table 11.2. The

status of nutrition is determined by a complex interaction between external environment factors and internal/constitutional factors:

(a) Constitutional/internal factors like physical activity sex, age, nutrition, behavior, and ailments.
(b) External environmental factors like safety of food, economic, cultural, and

social circumstances.

“Nutrient/Nutritional assessment, defined as the interpretation from laboratory,
dietary, anthropometric, and clinical studies, is used to determine the nutritional
status of individual or population groups as influenced by utilization and intake of
nutrients”. Definitions of some related terms used in this chapter are mentioned in
Table 11.1. The major goals of nutritional assessment are to recognize the presence
and type of malnutrition, to plan suitable diets as the prophylaxis in contrast to ailment later in life and to define health-threatening obesity (Kumar et al. 2019).
Malnutrition caused by illness is an imbalance between nutrient intake, energy and
needs. It causes the body to undergo a number of metabolic and functional changes
(Sumit et al. 2012). There are several limits to traditional nutrition evaluation metrics such as weight loss, mass index of body, consumption of food, or common laboratory indicators such as lymphocytes or albumin (García Almeida et al. 2021).

###### ***8.1 Assessment of Vitamin Status***

**8.1.1 Vitamin D**

8.1.1.1 Function of Vitamin D


327


Vitamin D is necessary for the maintenance of normal blood Ca and K level, which
are required for appropriate bone mineralization, nerve transmission, muscular contraction, and general cellular function in all the cells of the human body.

8.1.1.2 Sources of Vitamin D

Vitamin D is found primarily in two forms: D 2 (ergocalciferol) and D 3 (cholecalciferol). In addition to the D 2 and D 3 and forms of vitamin D, 25-hydroxy vitamin D
plays an important role in dietary vitamin D consumption. It is found in products
derived from animals. Fortified food contains D 2 and D 3 forms or vitamin D metabolite 25-hydroxy vitamin D (Benedik 2021). The exposure to sunlight is and essential source for the vitamin D. During the winter, when sunshine exposure is limited,
vitamin D stored in the adipose tissue is accessible.

8.1.1.3 Dietary Sources of Vitamin D

Vitamin D is only found in trace levels in a select few foods. Fish is a good source,
particularly fish with a lot of fat, such sardines, salmon, herring, and mackerel.
Other significant sources include beef, milk, eggs, and fortified foods like margarine
(Nowson and Margerison 2002).

8.1.1.4 Metabolism of Vitamin D

Vitamin D insufficiency is a widespread concern in many people across the world
(Lips 2010). Aside from its involvement in calcium and phosphate metabolism, current research has shown that vitamin D has a title role in vascular, inflammatory,
neoplastic, and neurological illnesses (Holick 2007). D 3 (cholecalciferol) and D 2
(ergocalciferol) are the two primary forms of vitamin D, which different in the
assembly of their side chains. The presence of a methyl group on carbon number 24
and double bond between the carbons (22 and 23) distinguishes side chain of vitamin D 2 from the D 3 (Zhao et al. 2015).

328

8.1.1.5 Deficiency of Vitamin D


A. Thakur et al.


Numerous disorders, including cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, cancer, rickets,
multiple sclerosis, and autoimmune disease, are linked to vitamin D and both their
occurrence and development (Herrmann et al. 2017).

**8.1.2 Vitamin B** **12** **(Cobalamin)**

8.1.2.1 Function of Vitamin B 12

The synthesis of red blood cells and deoxyribonucleic acid both require vitamin B 12 .
The formation and operation of nerve and brain cells are also significantly impacted
by it. Protein in our food forms a binding site for vitamin B 12 . Hydrochloric acids
and digestive enzymes in the stomach converts vitamin B 12 to its free form.

8.1.2.2 Sources of Vitamin B 12

Plant foods like as dried purple and green lavers, have significant levels of vitamin
B 12, but other edible algae contained only or none traces. The majority of cyanobacteria used in human supplements contain pseudo-vitamin B 12, which is inert in
humans. For older persons and vegetarians, fortified breakfast cereals are a very
beneficial source of vitamin B 12 (Watanabe 2007).

8.1.2.3 Dietary Source and Availability

Vitamin B 12 is synthesized in microbes enters the human food chain by integration
into animal-derived foods. Gastrointestinal fermentation promotes the development
of these vitamin B 12 -producing bacteria in several animals, which are then absorbed
and integrated into the tissue of animal. This is especially true for the liver, which
stores enormous amounts of vitamin B 12 . Unless the animal lives in one of the
numerous places known to be geochemically poor in cobalt, products from animals
which are herbivorous, such as meat, eggs, and milk are essential dietary sources of
the nutrient (Zent and Smith 1995).

8.1.2.4 Absorption of Vitamin B 12

The absorption pattern of vitamin B 12 is complicated. Vitamin B 12 in the food is
liberated from the proteins and is bound to proteins by the action of high concentration of the hydrochloric acid in the stomach (Shils et al. 1994).


-----

11 Nutraceuticals and Suboptimal Health: The Relationship and Significance

8.1.2.5 Deficiency of Vitamin B 12


329


Vitamin B 12 (cobalamin) is vital for DNA synthesis and neurological function.
Deficiency of vitamin B 12 can cause a variety of hematologic and neuropsychiatric
diseases, many of which can be reversed with early detection and therapy (Oh and
Brown 2003).

**8.1.3 Vitamin C**

8.1.3.1 Function of Vitamin C

Vitamin C is an antioxidant or electron giver, and this role accounts for the majority
of its biochemical and molecular actions.

8.1.3.2 Sources of Vitamin C

Vitamin C is plentiful in many natural sources, such as fresh vegetables and fruits.
Citrus fruits such as oranges, limes, Tomatoes, lemons, papaya, potatoes, red &
green peppers, strawberries and kiwifruits, Indian gooseberry, leafy green vegetables like as fortified cereals & broccoli all are rich in vitamin C (Devaki and
Raveendran 2017).

8.1.3.3 Dietary Sources of Vitamin C

Numerous plants and fruits contain ascorbate. Citrus juices and fruits are particularly abundant in vitamin C, but other fruits with varying vitamin C content also
include cherries, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, papaya, kiwi fruits, strawberries,
watermelon, tomatoes and tangelo (Madhavi et al. 2019). The best sources of vitamin C may be vegetables rather than fruits, including brussels & bean sprouts, broccoli, cabbage, kale, cauliflower, mustard greens, peas, green & red peppers, tomatoes
and potatoes (Haytowitz 1995).

8.1.3.4 Deficiency of Vitamin C

In humans, the deficiency of the vitamin C causes a major disease which is known
as scurvy. The majority of symptoms related to scurvy manifest in mesenchymal
tissues. It causes poor wound healing, bleeding (due to insufficient intercellular
material creation) in skin, oedema, mucosal membranes, internal muscles & organs
and weakness in collagenous structures in connective tissues bone, teeth, and cartilage (Devaki and Raveendran 2017).

**8.1.4 Vitamin A**

8.1.4.1 Function of Vitamin A


A. Thakur et al.


Retinol, often known as vitamin A, is a critical ingredient that supports proper
growth and development, immune system health, reproduction, and the operation of
the visual system in humans.

8.1.4.2 Sources of Vitamin A

Vitamin A is present in animal sources as retinol, which is the active form of vitamin
A. In particular, fish liver is an excellent source. Dairy products and egg yolk (which
is not white in color) and such as milk (which includes human breast milk), butter
and cheese are other animal sources. Meat, which is derived from the animal’s muscles, is not an excellent source. Plant sources include vitamin A in the form of
carotenoids, which must be transformed into retinol during digestion before the
body can utilize it. Carotenoids are the pigments that give plants their color which
is green as well as certain vegetables and fruits their particular color (Gilbert 2013).

8.1.4.3 Dietary Sources of Vitamin A

Glandular meats, human milk, fish liver and liver oils (particularly), whole dairy &
milk products and egg yolk, are practically entirely sources of preformed vitamin
A. Preformed form of vitamin A is also added to processed foods such as sauces,
sugar, oils and fats. Green leafy vegetables (e.g., amaranth spinach), yellow &
orange non-citrus fruits (e.g., papaya, mangoes, and apricots) and yellow vegetables
(e.g., carrots, squash, and pumpkins) contain pro-vitamin A carotenoids. Red palm
oil, which is produced in numerous places across the world, is particularly high in
precursor of vitamin A (Rodriguez-Amaya 1997).

8.1.4.4 Deficiency of Vitamin A

The deficiency of the vitamin A is not merely known. It is defined by world health
organization as tissue of vitamin A concentrations low enough for negative health
repercussions even if clinical xerophthalmia is not present. Some of particular
symptoms and signs associated with the risk of irreversible blindness and xerophthalmia, non-specific symptoms of xerophthalmia also include poor reproductive
health, higher morbidity and mortality, contributing to slower development and
growth and an increased hazard of anaemia (World Health Organization 2009).

**8.1.5 Vitamin E**

8.1.5.1 Function of Vitamin E


331


The key biological function of vitamin E is to prevent free radicals from oxidizing
PUFAs, and low-density lipoprotein and other components of cell membranes
(LDL) (Duthie 1993).

8.1.5.2 Sources of Vitamin E

Vitamin E may be found in a variety of foods. Vitamin E is found in abundance in
seeds and fruits. Green vegetables are another good source. It is synthesized by
photosynthetic organisms and plants. Dietary supplements are also an essential
source of vitamin E. The vitamin E in pills is significantly more than the vitamin E
in meals (Niki and Abe 2019).

8.1.5.3 Dietary Sources of Vitamin E

Both plant-based diets and animal products naturally contain vitamin E, and producers frequently add it to processed meals and vegetable oils.

8.1.5.4 Deficiency of Vitamin E

The deficiency of vitamin E leads to issues with the muscles and nervous system
(Jeet and Baldi 2015). The leakage of the muscle enzymes like pyruvate and creatine kinase into the plasma, elevated levels of lipid peroxidation products in the
plasma and enhanced erythrocytes haemolysis are some of the early diagnostic
symptoms of deficiency (Sokol 1988).
###### ***8.2 Assessment of Protein Status***

**8.2.1 Function of Protein**

It is significant in the diet as the source of amino acids, that are vital for protein
synthesis in body and some other important compounds consist of nitrogen. The
latter include nucleotides, creatine, nucleic acids and polypeptide hormones and
some neurotransmitters and other polypeptide hormones (Hoffman and Falvo 2004).


-----

332

**8.2.2 Sources of Protein**


A. Thakur et al.


Eating nuts, whole grains, legumes (peas and beans), seeds, and other plant-based
sources of protein is good for the health and environment.

**8.2.3 Sources and Dietary Intakes**

The food of animal origin is the major source of protein. Cereal grains can supply
up to 23% of the total intake of the protein in these diets. The adequacy of protein
depends on quality as well as quantity (Madrigal et al. 2021).

**8.2.4 Absorption and Metabolism**

A number of proteolytic enzymes hydrolyze dietary protein in the gastro-intestinal
tract. The final products in the digestion of free amino acids, protein, and tiny peptides, are took up by the mucosal cells in small intestine by an energy-requiring
process involving several carrier systems (Bilsborough and Mann 2006).

**8.2.5 Deficiency of Protein**

During temporary changes in dietary intake, the key loss of protein occurs from the
visceral protein pool (De Blaauw et al. 1996). In chronic absence states, the largest
single contributor to protein loss is the skeletal muscle.

**8.2.6 Effect of High Intake**

High intakes or habitual of protein can increase the risk for diabetes, renal cell cancer and prostate cancer. Additional adverse effects on bone health and immune competence were also reported (Wolfe et al. 2008).
###### ***8.3 Assessment of Mineral Status***

Mineral elements recognized to be vital in human nutrition include macro minerals
(calcium, potassium, magnesium, Sulphur, sodium, and chlorine) and trace minerals (iron, zinc, copper, nickel, carbon, selenium, chromium, iodine and more).
Naturally, the bulk of these substances enter the body through the gastrointestinal
tract on a regular basis. As a result, the bioavailability, or the portion of an eaten
substance that is absorbed, is a complicated relationship between a number of
dietary conditions, involves the source of protein (Arora and Baldi 2015b).


-----

11 Nutraceuticals and Suboptimal Health: The Relationship and Significance


333


The bioavailability of minerals in ingested meals is also influenced by the chemical makeup of the element in question as well as the metabolic and nutritional status
of the host (Janghorbani and Young 1980).

**8.3.1 Function of Minerals**

Minerals are necessary for the wellness of body. Minerals are used by the human
body for a variety of purposes, including the normal functioning of bones, muscles,
the heart, and the brain. They are also required for the production of enzymes and
hormones. (Basic function of minerals is mentioned in Table 11.2). They are classified into two major types such as macrominerals and trace minerals (Majewski
et al. 2016).

**8.3.2 Sources of Minerals**

Meat, cereals, fish, dairy, bread, nuts, milk, fruit (mainly dried fruit), and vegetables
are very rich in minerals.

**8.3.3 Deficiency of Minerals**

Minerals are certain types of nutrients that the body need to function effectively.
The deficiency of mineral occurs when the body does not absorb or receive enough
of the mineral. To maintain health, the human body requires varying quantities of
each mineral (Arora et al. 2013).
###### ***8.4 Assessment of Iron***

It is crucial to evaluate the population’s iron status since iron insufficiency is the
most common micronutrient deficit in developed and low-income nations.

**8.4.1 Function of Iron**

Seventy percent of iron is present in the hemoglobin, which is the oxygen carrying
pigment of the red blood cells (RBCs) that plays a critical role in transferring the
oxygen from lungs to tissues. About 4% of body iron is present in myoglobin, the
oxygen binding storage protein found in muscle. The structure of myoglobin is
similar to hemoglobin, except that it contains only one globin chain and one heme
unit. Trace quantities of iron are also associated with transport of several electrons
and enzymes (Gupta 2014).


-----

334

**8.4.2 Sources of Iron**

Food is the only natural source of iron.

**8.4.3 Dietary Sources of Iron**


A. Thakur et al.


Many dietary supplements include iron. The best supplements are those that have
readily absorbable iron with little adverse effects. It is best to take iron under the
guidance of a doctor. Multivitamin/multimineral iron supplements, particularly
those geared toward women, often contain 18 mg of iron (Moustarah and
Mohiuddin 2019).

**8.4.4 Absorption and Metabolism**

There are three main factors in the body operates to maintain the balance and prevent iron deficiency and iron overload. These are in-take, storage and loss of iron.
Iron intake is measured by the bioavailability and quantity of iron in the diet and the
capacity to absorb the iron. The quantity of dietary iron get absorbed is measured by
the nutritional needs of the specific and by the factors influencing the bioavailability
of the ingested iron (Anderson et al. 2009).

**8.4.5 Deficiency of Iron**

The deficiency of iron is prevalent in young offspring, infants and pregnant women.
It may arise from adequate intakes of poor absorption, excessive losses, dietary iron
or combination of these factors (Camaschella 2019).
###### ***8.5 Assessment of Magnesium***

**8.5.1 Function of Magnesium**

Soft tissue magnesium maintains the electrical potential of cell membranes and neural tissues, and works as the cofactor of several enzymes which are involved in
synthesis of protein, synthesis of DNA & RNA, metabolism of energy, and other
processes. The function of magnesium in controlling potassium fluxes & their participation in the metabolism of the calcium are particularly significant with regard
to the pathologic implications of magnesium deficiency (Classen 1984).

11 Nutraceuticals and Suboptimal Health: The Relationship and Significance

**8.5.2 Sources of Magnesium**


335


Magnesium may be found in a wide array of nutrient-dense foods like as nuts, seeds,
legumes, whole grains, and a variety of vegetables and fruits.

**8.5.3 Dietary Sources of Magnesium**

Magnesium deficit in the diet that is severe enough to cause pathologic alterations
is uncommon. Magnesium is extensively distributed in meals from both plants and
animals, and its concentration in food is rarely significantly influenced by geochemical processes or other environmental factors. Magnesium is abundant in many
foods, including soy flour, certain shellfish, beans nuts, legume seeds, and peas.
These foods often contain more than 500 mg of magnesium per kilogram of fresh
weight. Many highly refined flours, tubers, fruits, and mushrooms, as well as most
fats and oils, supply little dietary magnesium i.e., 100 kg/mg fresh weight, despite
the fact that most unprocessed cereal grains are reasonable suppliers (Paul and
Southgate 1978).

**8.5.4 Deficiency of Magnesium**

Pathologic consequences of primary dietary magnesium shortage are uncommon in
babies and much less prevalent in adults unless the relatively lower intake of magnesium is followed by persistent diarrhea or significant urine magnesium losses
(Lönnerdal 1995). As demands for the magnesium increased significantly with the
return of tissue development during the rehabilitation from basic malnutrition, susceptibility to the consequences of magnesium insufficiency increases (Shils 1988).
The majority of the early pathologic effects of magnesium deficiency are neuromuscular or neurologic abnormalities, some of which are likely due to the element’s
influence on potassium transport within tissues (Gibson 1990).
###### ***8.6 Assessment of Selenium***

**8.6.1 Function of Selenium**

Selenium has been associated with the maintenance of immune defenses, safety of
biological tissues against, the control of development & growth and the oxidative stress.


-----

336

**8.6.2 Sources of Selenium**

Protein foods from animals are the major sources of the selenium.

**8.6.3 Dietary Sources of Selenium**


A. Thakur et al.


Cooked plantains, shelled soybeans, cooked Brussels sprouts, raw broccoli, and
cooked fresh spinach are some other vegetables that consist of more than 2 mg of
selenium whereas 4 cooked spears of asparagus contain nearly 4 μg (Hu et al. 2021).

**8.6.4 Absorption and Bioavailability of Selenium**

Humans typically absorb selenium compounds quite effectively, and selenium
absorption does not seem to be controlled by homeostasis. For instance, selenite
form of selenium absorbs more than 80%, and absorb more than 90% in case of
selenomethionine or selenate (Patterson et al. 1993).

**8.6.5 Deficiency of Selenium**

Selenium deficiency causes selenium sensitive illnesses in a variety of animal species, including muscular dystrophy, exudative diathesis, and hepatosis dietetica.
Selenium deficiency causes irregular electrocardiograms and blood pressure abnormalities in rats and lambs. Human heart disease mortality is also reduced in places
with high levels of selenium (Shamberger 1981).
###### ***8.7 Assessment of Zinc***

**8.7.1 Function of Zinc**

The immune system is heavily reliant on zinc, which has a variety of effects on cellular and humoral immunity (Shankar and Prasad 1998).

**8.7.2 Sources of Zinc**

Poultry, low-fat cheese, pork, milk, yogurt, nuts, leafy, eggs, crustaceans, whole
grains, beef kidney, lamb, liver, mollusks, heart and root vegetables are some examples of sources of zinc (Solomons 2001).

Zinc concentrations in whole-grain cereals, legumes, red meat, and lentils range
from 380 to 760 mol/kg (25–50 mg/kg) raw weight. Low extraction rate processed
cereals, polished rice, and high or lean fat content meat have a reasonable zinc level
of 150–380 mol/kg (10–25 mg/kg). Fruits, green leafy vegetables, roots and tubers,
and fish are all low in zinc (10 mg/kg (150 mol/kg)) (Alloway 2008). The zinc level
in separated oils and fats, sugar, and alcohol is quite low. Utilization of zinc is influenced by the diet’s general make-up. Numerous dietary components have been discovered by experimental research as possible boosters or antagonists of zinc
absorption (Sandström and Lönnerdal 1989).

**8.7.4 Deficiency of Zinc**

Sever zinc deficiency in humans causes reduced appetite, growth retardation, diarrhea, skin lesions, baldness, delayed sexual and bone development, increased susceptibility to infections caused by immune system deficiencies, and the emergence
of behavioral disorders. The effect of mild and marginal zinc deficiency is very rare
(Hambidge 1986).
###### **9 Conclusion**

Consuming a diversified nutrient-dense diet is essential for maintaining and promoting suboptimal health throughout the ageing process. Food nutrient quality is
critical since inadequate nutrition is a major cause of many chronic and infectious
illnesses in humans. Human nutrition science is primarily concerned with identifying the dietary requirements for the protection, promotion, and maintenance of
wellbeing in all populations. Such information is required to evaluate the nutritional
sufficiency of a diet for the growth of babies, children, and adolescents, as well as
for the preservation of health in adults of both sexes and during pregnancy and
breastfeeding in women. A variety of terminologies have been used in this context
to specify the quantity needed, minimum requirements, suggested intakes, or allowances, and safe level of intake. Overall, following a nutritious diet and nutrients that
are vital elements including lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals,
water, fruit, whole grains, vegetables, nuts, chicken, fish, legumes, as well as dairy
products with low amount of fat, can be good for treating a number of diseases. This
book chapter has been extensively focused on the relation between the dietary nutrients and suboptimal health status. The role of various microorganisms, nutrients and
biomarkers is discussed. This will surely give readers basic and deep understandings and deep insights related to dietary nutrients for the maintenance of their health.

###### **1 Introduction**

The human body relies on the intake and metabolism of nutrients in appropriate
proportion and balance to sustain normal physiological functions. However, an
excessive intake of nutrients can have significant consequences on metabolic re-­
programming, particularly during early life. This programming refers to the long-­
term effects that early nutritional experiences have on an individual’s metabolic
regulation and overall health. Excessive nutrient intake during this critical developmental period can alter various mechanisms that can profoundly impact the body’s
energy sensing, appetite regulation, insulin sensitivity of adipose tissue and the
functioning of brown adipose tissue. Understanding the potential mechanisms
underlying metabolic programming resulting from excess nutrition intake during
early life is crucial for evaluating the long-term consequences of overnutrition and
its impact on overall health. This chapter sheds light on the complex interplay
between excessive nutrient intake and metabolic outcomes. World Health

Organization (WHO) establishes a minimum protein requirement of 0.8 g/day for
adults of an ideal weight (Mathur and Pillai 2019; Council NR 1989).
Nutrition plays a vital role in sustaining life along with promoting optimal
growth and health. A balanced and healthy diet is essential to provide the necessary
nutrients that the human body requires. Extensive research and millennia of eating
practices have consistently highlighted the significant impact of diet on human

well-being. It is widely acknowledged that nutritional intake varies across different
demographic groups reflecting the diverse dietary habits and cultural influences
around the world. The reports on the Global Burden of Disease have shed light on
the alarming statistics regarding the health implications of poor nutrition.
Approximately one in five global deaths are primarily attributed to cancer and cardiovascular diseases and can be linked to inadequate nutritional values. Furthermore,
a significant portion of the population, approximately one-third, experiences excess
nutrient intake. The consequences of excessive nutrient intake extend beyond mere
overconsumption; they contribute to the development of various illnesses and metabolic disorders. It results in binge eating disorder, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), renal
complications, infertility and Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The
implications of excessive nutrient intake lead to alterations in cellular pathways and
abnormal tissue remodelling. These changes can ultimately lead to the manifestation of pathophysiological conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, fatty liver, and erectile dysfunction (Siepmann et al. 2011). The
impact of excessive nutrient intake on health outcomes is multifaceted, and it
depends on both the quantity and duration of nutrient consumption. Consequently,
understanding the upper limits of nutrient consumption becomes crucial as it helps
to distinguish safe intake levels from potentially dangerous ones. Establishing preventive measures to mitigate the negative health effects of excess nutrient intake
necessitates considering various factors, including the dosage, frequency, and duration of nutrient intake, as well as the potency of the nutrients involved. By carefully
monitoring and regulating nutrient intake, individuals can strive to maintain a balance that promotes health and minimizes the risks associated with excessive consumption (Penagini et al. 2015; Candela et al. 2011).

In this era of abundant food availability and sedentary lifestyles, it is imperative
to address the issue of excess nutrient intake and its far-reaching consequences. By
gaining a deeper understanding of the intricate relationship between nutrient intake,
metabolic processes, and health outcomes, we can develop effective strategies to
promote moderation and balance in our diets. Additionally, fostering awareness
about the risks of excessive nutrient intake and the importance of making informed
dietary choices can empower individuals to take control of their health and well-­
being. In this comprehensive exploration of the implications of excessive nutrient
intake, we will delve into the various mechanisms through which excessive consumption can affect the body (Fig. 12.1). By examining the dose-dependent nature
of nutrient intake, the potential risks associated with specific nutrients, and the
development of preventive measures, we can gain valuable insights into the complexities of maintaining a healthy nutritional balance. Through a collective effort to
address this issue, one can work towards a healthier future where nutrition is optimized, and the risks of excessive intake are mitigated. This chapter sheds light on
the complex interplay between excessive nutrient intake and metabolic outcomes.

###### **2 Balanced Diet and Nutrient Groups**


347


The foundation of good health and well-being lies in maintaining a balanced diet
and ensuring proper nutrition. Food is the primary supplier of the essential nutrients
necessary for body growth, development and vital functions. A balanced diet
involves consuming a variety of nutrients in appropriate proportions to fulfil body’s
nutritional requirements (Price 2005). A recent study given by Hu et al. found a correlation between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and a balanced diet. In rheumatoid
arthritis, the eating of healthy foods such as ω-2-fatty acid-rich nuts, fruits and
whole grains is considered a balanced diet and unhealthy red and processed meat,
sugar-sweetened beverages, trans-fats and sodium affect human health. Higher
scores are associated with a healthy lifestyle and reduced risk of RA (Hu et al. 2017).

Obesity is a major health concern as a metabolic disease. Advanced lifestyle
changes, health habits, unbalanced meals, and lack of body movements and

exercise, may result in cause metabolic disease. Studies were conducted to tackle
such situations and prevent metabolic diseases. They recommended that ratios of
fat:carbohydrate:protein in the diet should be 25:55:20, in addition also reduced the
consumption of soda and sweetened foods. WHO also recommended that the sugar
intake be less than 5 g/day (Lim 2018). A study has indicated that a well-balanced
diet should include various micronutrients, notably vitamins A, C, and D, along
with trace elements like Zinc and Selenium, to ensure optimal functioning of the
immune system (Jayawardena and Misra 2020). This variety of foods from nutrient
groups in our diet ensures that to receive a balanced array of essential nutrients for
optimal health and well-being.
###### **3 Selection of Food Based on Demography**

The selection of food, based on demography, is determined by numerous factors
viz. age, sex, dietary preferences and choices, including cultural, geographic, economic, and social factors. Different demographic groups may have distinct food
preferences, traditions, and dietary restrictions. Diverse cultures and ethnicities
have their own traditional foods and dietary practices. Asian cuisines often feature
rice, noodles, and seafood, while Middle Eastern cuisine incorporates ingredients
like olive oil, chickpeas, and spices. Cultural preferences and dietary restrictions,
such as vegetarianism or religious dietary guidelines, can also influence food
choices within specific demographic groups.

The availability of certain foods can vary depending on the geographic location.
Coastal regions may have greater access to seafood, while inland areas may have a
preference for meat or agricultural products. Climate and environmental factors also
influence the types of crops grown and consumed in different regions, such as tropical fruits in tropical areas or root vegetables in colder climates (Trichopoulou et al.
2007). Economic factors play a significant role in food selection. Lower-income
individuals or communities may have limited fresh nutritious foods and rely more
on processed or less expensive options (Wolfson et al. 2019). Conversely, higher-­
income individuals may have more access to a variety of high-quality and organic
foods. Different age groups may have specific dietary needs and preferences. For
example, infants and young children have different nutritional requirements than
older adults. Adolescents may have specific preferences influenced by peer groups,
while older adults may need to consider dietary modifications to address age-related
health concerns. Demographic groups may have specific dietary restrictions or
allergies that impact their food choices. For example, individuals with lactose intolerance may avoid dairy products, while those with celiac disease must avoid gluten-­
containing foods. Religious dietary practices, such as kosher or halal, also influence
food selection within certain populations (Verbeke 2005).

###### **4 Hypervitaminosis** ***4.1 Vitamin A and Carotenoids***


349


Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin responsible for vision, immune function and cellular growth and differentiation. The recommended dietary intake for vitamin A
varies by age and gender but generally ranges from 600 to 900 μg per day for adults.
Carotenoids are plant pigments that have antioxidant properties and are important
for maintaining healthy skin and preventing chronic diseases. α- and β-carotene and
β-cryptoxanthin are provitamin A carotenoids and can be converted to vitamin A
(Weber and Grune 2012). While these nutrients are important, excess intake of
carotenoids and vitamin A can have negative health effects. The excess intake of
vitamin A also known as hypervitaminosis A leads to health problems, including
liver damage, bone abnormalities and increased pressure on the brain. The symptoms of hypervitaminosis A include skin rash, nausea, and joint pain.

A study conducted on female rats indicated a significant fall in pregnancy rate
and litter-carrying capacity on excessive intake of vitamin A. The anomaly in skull
and brain development was also observed in the offspring. Further, intermittent
defects such as glossia, harelip, cleft palate and eye defects were also observed
(Cohlan 1953). Another independent study on rats also indicated the shortening of
the mandible and maxilla, anencephaly, eye defects, cleft palate, spina bifida with
meningocele and hydrocephalus caused to hypervitaminosis A (Geelen and Peters
1979). Spina bifida and cleft palate are congenital deformities caused due to excessive intake of vitamin A. It is postulated that the palatogensis is affected due to
interference in cell division during shelf outgrowth, epithelial differentiation and
apoptosis in shelf fusion. It also prevents hydration of the extracellular matrix leading to a hampered shelf elevation process. A high level of vitamin A also alters the
action of growth factors like platelet-derived growth factor and transforming growth
factor-β (Ackermans et al. 2011). The long-term excessive intake of vitamin A has
also been associated with an increased risk of fractures and osteoporosis. It inhibits
osteoblast activity and increases the rate of osteoclast formation. The regulation and
maintenance of calcium levels by vitamin D in serum at a normal range is also hampered. It apparently shows an increased level of calcium in the serum and faster
bone reabsorption, which lowers density and increases the biomarker of bones
(Feskanich et al. 2002).

It is important to note that excessive intake of vitamin A is rare and usually only
occurs with high-dose supplements. Carotenoids are not associated with the same
risk of toxicity as vitamin A, but excessive intake of carotenoids can still have negative health effects. High doses of carotenoids can cause a yellowing of the skin
called carotenemia, which is not harmful but can be mistaken for jaundice (Lascari
1981). In addition, high doses of carotenoids may increase the risk of lung cancer in
smokers. This is thought to be due to the antioxidant properties of carotenoids,
which can protect cells from damage caused by smoking but also protect cancer
cells from being destroyed by the immune system. However, some other studies

show inhibition of carcinogen-induced neoplastic transformation of lung cells
(Epstein 2003).
###### ***4.2 Vitamin B 1***

Thiamin or vitamin B 1 plays a vital role in energy metabolism and neuronal function. It is considered safe and essential for the proper body functioning. The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for adults is around 1.1–1.2 mg and 0.8–0.9 mg for
males and females, respectively (Lonsdale 2006). However, excessive intake of
thiamin is uncommon and usually not associated with significant health hazards. As
vitamin B 1 is water-soluble, hence consumption of an excess amount is usually
excreted through urine. Unlike other fat-soluble vitamins with a tendency to accumulate at toxic levels, the body does not store large amounts of thiamin. It is
obtained from natural food sources and is generally well-tolerated, and rare to
excessive consumption through a regular diet. The adverse effects include ataxia,
impaired gut motility, lethargy, nausea and urticaria (Martel et al. 2021). In rare
cases, at extremely high doses than RDA thiamin may cause adverse events. These
can include allergic reactions such as itching, rash, or difficulty in breathing. These
reactions are uncommon but should be taken seriously. It may also cause mild and
temporary digestive disturbances such as stomach pain, nausea, and diarrhoea. ***4.3 Vitamin B 2***

Vitamin B 2, also known as riboflavin, plays several important roles viz. synthesis of
flavin adenine dinucleotide and flavin mononucleotide which are responsible for
energy production. Further, it is a cofactor for the anti-oxidant enzyme in the body
and maintains healthy eyes and skin. The RDA for riboflavin is approximately 1.3
and 1.1 mg for adult males and females per day, respectively (Schellack et al. 2019).

Excessive intake of riboflavin is generally considered safe. However, some
potential effects may occur in rare cases of extremely high doses. These effects
include discolouration of urine that results in urine turning yellow and fluorescent
(Rivlin and Pinto 2001). It also causes mild gastrointestinal (GIT) disturbance viz.
diarrhoea, nausea, or an upset stomach. Some individuals may experience increased
photosensitivity to sunlight, but this effect is more common with certain metabolic
disorders like erythropoietic protoporphyria (Cardoso et al. 2012). It may also result
in angular cheilitis, dysfunctional liver, photophobia, itching, burning or prickling
sensation, cardiomyopathies and hypotension (Elango et al. 2015).

###### ***4.4 Vitamin B 3***


351


Vitamin B 3 or Niacin, a water-soluble vitamin, with various important roles in the
body including energy metabolism. The RDA dose of niacin is 20 mg per day
(Capuzzi et al. 2000). It is responsible for the synthesis of coenzymes nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
(NADP). It is further responsible for the repair of damaged DNA, gene expression,
cell signalling and maintaining skin health (Henderson 1983). It also increases
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and decreases low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and
triglycerides (Kamanna and Kashyap 2008). Excessive intake of niacin can have
certain effects on the body. It may be responsible for harmless and temporary flushing at high doses due to vasodilation of blood vessels present in skin mediated
through prostaglandin D 2, leading to a warm, tingling, and reddening sensation
known as niacin flush (Kamanna et al. 2009). Its excess intake also causes nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain, similar to other vitamin B.
###### ***4.5 Vitamin B 5***

Pantothenic acid, vitamin B 5, is having various body functions including the synthesis of coenzyme A (CoA). The CoA is responsible for the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Further, the acetyl CoA synthesised from pantothenic acid
is responsible for the synthesis of fatty acids, cholesterol, and certain neurotransmitters. It is responsible for the production of skin cells and plays a role in wound healing (Novelli 1953). The RDA for vitamin B 5 is 1.4–4 mg in children and 5 mg in
adolescents and adults. No specific side effects related to high pantothenic acid
intake have been reported in the literature. However, extremely high doses may lead
to gastrointestinal disturbances, such as diarrhoea (Tahiliani and Beinlich 1991). ***4.6 Vitamin B 6***

Vitamin B 6, pyridoxine, is naturally found in food and is present in the form of
cofactor pyridoxal 5′ phosphate. It is involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates,
proteins, and fats, and in bioenergetics. It is also involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters, including dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid and serotonin. The
production of haemoglobin, immune cells and antibodies (Bender 1994). The daily
RDA for vitamin B 6 is between 0.1–1 mg for children and 1.2–1.3 mg for adolescents and adults. However, its demand increases during pregnancy and lactation up
to 1.9–2 mg per day.

The excessive intake of vitamin B 6 leads to sensory neuropathy resulting in
numbness, tingling, or burning sensations in the hands and feet (Institute of Medicine

(US) Standing Committee on the Scientific Evaluation of Dietary Reference Intakes
and its Panel on Folate, Other B Vitamins, and Choline 1998). This condition is
often characterised by impairments in sensory perception, particularly touch and
vibration sensations. The other neurological symptoms include difficulty in walking, poor coordination, and impaired muscle control (Hemminger and Wills 2020).
###### ***4.7 Vitamin B 7***

Vitamin B 7 or biotin, a water-soluble vitamin, acts as a coenzyme and is involved in
the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins and the associated energy production. It promotes healthy nails, skin, and hair, and maintains structural integrity.
It is involved in gene expression, specifically in the activation of certain genes that
are responsible for regulating cell growth and development. The RDA for biotin
varies depending on age and life stage with infant: 5 μg, children: 8–20 μg and
adults: 30 μg daily (Schellack et al. 2016). It is observed that excessive biotin intake
results in allergic reactions including skin rashes, itching and difficulty in breathing.
The excess intake of biotin can improve the symptoms associated with vitamin B 12
deficiency, such as anaemia and nerve damage, without addressing the underlying
deficiency itself (Powe et al. 2003). This may delay the proper diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B 12 deficiency. High doses of biotin can interfere with certain laboratory tests, leading to inaccurate results. Biotin can bind to assay components used
in these tests, which may affect the measurement of various analytes, including
hormones and other biomarkers (Odhaib et al. 2019). ***4.8 Vitamin B 9***

Folic acid, also known as vitamin B 9, is a vital nutrient and is responsible for DNA
synthesis and cell division. It is involved in the production of new cells, including
red blood cells, and supports overall tissue growth and development. It aids in the
production of the heme group of haemoglobin. Sufficient folic acid levels can subside the defects in the neural tube, such as anencephaly and spina bifida. The RDA
of folate is 65–300 μg for children and 400 μg for adolescents and adults.

Excessive folic acid supplement intake may increase the risk of certain cancers.
Research suggests a high-dose folic acid supplementation may promote the growth
of existing precancerous or cancerous cells (Wien et al. 2012; Ebbing et al. 2009).
Very high doses of folic acid can interfere with certain laboratory tests, particularly
those measuring vitamin B 12 levels. Elevated folic acid levels can mask a true vitamin B 12 deficiency, leading to inaccurate test results and potential misdiagnosis (de
Benoist 2008). Excessive folic acid intake can mask the presence of anaemia by
improving the haematological parameters and haemoglobin levels, without addressing the underlying cause of the anaemia.

###### ***4.9 Vitamin B 12***


353


Cyanocobalamin, a synthetic vitamin B 12 analogue, plays a crucial role in the formation of red blood cells. It is essential for the synthesis of DNA and RNA. It is
necessary for maintaining proper nervous system function. It plays a role in the
synthesis of myelin, a protective covering around nerve fibres that ensures proper
transmission of nerve impulses. There is no known toxicity associated with excessive intake of cyanocobalamin. High doses of cyanocobalamin can affect laboratory
test results used to measure vitamin B 12 levels. This can cause artificially high levels
of serum vitamin B 12, potentially leading to misdiagnosis or inaccurate assessment
of vitamin B 12 status (Hvas and Nexo 2006).
###### ***4.10 Vitamin C***

Vitamin C is a strong antioxidant involved in protecting the body from free radicals
and helps in maintaining the health of skin, bones, and blood vessels. It is involved
in collagen synthesis, a protein providing structure to various connective tissues,
including skin, tendons, ligaments, and blood vessels. It supports the healing of
wounds and maintains the integrity of the skin. It enhances the production and function of immune cells that protect against infections (Carr and Maggini 2017). It
boosts non-heme iron absorption that is present in plant-based foods (Bendich et al.
1986). The RDA for vitamin C varies and is typically around 75–90 mg per day
for adults.

Very high doses of vitamin C, typically above 2000–3000 mg per day, can cause
GIT disturbances such as diarrhoea, nausea, and stomach cramps. These symptoms
usually resolve once vitamin C intake is reduced. Excessive intake of vitamin C may
increase the risk of kidney stones, particularly in patients with a history of pre-­
existing kidney conditions or kidney stones. It can be metabolized into oxalate that
contributes to the formation of calcium oxalate stones (D’Costa et al. 2019). High
serum vitamin C can interfere with some laboratory tests, including blood glucose
and urine tests for various substances (Ten Berge et al. 2021). ***4.11 Vitamin D***

Vitamin D is involved in calcium and phosphate absorption from the intestines and
promotes their incorporation into bones and teeth. It helps to maintain proper levels
of these minerals in the blood, ensuring optimal bone health and preventing conditions like rickets and osteomalacia in children and adults, respectively. It supports
bone strength and mineralization along with calcium. It modulates immune system
function, including promoting the function of immune cells and reducing

inflammation. It acts as a hormone that can affect gene expression regulating cellular growth, differentiation, and proliferation. The RDA for vitamin D for most
adults ranges from 600–800 international units per day (Holick 2003).

Excessive intake of vitamin D, known as vitamin D toxicity or hypervitaminosis
D. It leads to elevated levels of calcium in the blood resulting in nausea, vomiting,
increased thirst and urination, abdominal pain, constipation, fatigue, and confusion.
It can lead to the deposition of calcium in soft tissues, such as blood vessels, the
heart, lungs, and kidneys. Calcium can accumulate in the kidneys and form stones,
which can be painful. It may experience GIT symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting,
and poor appetite (Morita et al. 1993).
###### ***4.12 Vitamin E***

Vitamin E is a strong antioxidant and protects cells from oxidative damage caused
by reduced oxidative stress. It maintains the integrity and stability of cell membranes and prevents lipid oxidation. It supports the immune system’s function by
enhancing immune cells’ activity and promoting antibodies production. It helps to
moisturize the skin and improve its texture by protecting against damage (Brigelius-­
Flohé and Traber 1999).

Hypervitaminosis E is rare and primarily associated with high-dose supplementation. It acts as a blood thinner and interferes with blood clotting which leads to an
increased risk of bleeding. It can suppress the immune response to infections and
impair immune function. Some individuals may experience GIT symptoms, such as
diarrhoea, nausea, and stomach cramps due to hypervitaminosis E. It can interact
with vitamin K and blood coagulation (Murphy 1974). ***4.13 Vitamin K***

Vitamin K is involved in the synthesis of clotting factors in the liver. It is involved
in bone protein metabolism and contributes to bone health by promoting proper
bone mineralization. It may help to prevent arterial calcification potentially reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. The RDA for vitamin K is around 90–120 μg
per day for adults (Olson 1984). Excessive vitamin K intake can interfere with the
effectiveness of anticoagulants, such as warfarin. In rare cases, extremely high
doses of vitamin K may promote excessive blood clotting. Certain individuals may
experience allergic reactions, such as skin rashes or itching, with excessive vitamin
K intake (Vermeer 2012).

The details of dietary intake, sources, RDA and upper limits of vitamins are
included in Table 12.1.

###### **5 Excess Mineral Uptake** ***5.1 Calcium***


L. Akotkar and A. Ganeshpurkar


Calcium is crucial for the development and maintenance of healthy bones. It is
essential for muscle contraction, including all types of muscle and triggers the
release of calcium ions, that initiate muscle contraction. It is involved in transmitting nerve impulses throughout the body and is necessary for the blood clotting
process (Peacock 2010).

Excessive intake of calcium, known as hypercalcemia leads accumulation of calcium with other substances such as oxalate or phosphate forming calculi in the urinary tract and causing pain and discomfort. Excessive calcium intake causes
constipation, bloating, and abdominal discomfort. It also deposits in other soft tissues and can interfere with the absorption process of other essential minerals, such
as magnesium, zinc and iron (Li et al. 2018).
###### ***5.2 Iron***

Iron plays a crucial role in various physiological body functions. It is a fundamental
component of haemoglobin, a protein responsible for carrying oxygen in the body
tissues. It is also involved in other vital processes, including energy production,
DNA synthesis, and immune function. Iron-containing enzymes, such as cytochromes, are vital components of the electron transport chain that produce energy
as adenosine triphosphate (Wessling-Resnick 2017).

Hereditary hemochromatosis is a genetic condition causing iron overload. It
results in repeated blood transfusions. Certain medical conditions or excessive iron
supplementation cause an overload of iron. Excess iron can cause oxidative stress
and free radical damage, leading to tissue injury, and organ damage, especially in
the liver, heart, and pancreas. There is an increased risk of chronic liver cirrhosis,
diabetes, heart disease and joint pain (Fleming and Ponka 2012). ***5.3 Copper***

Copper is an essential trace mineral that plays a vital role in numerous physiological
functions in the body. It is required in micro quantity for proper growth, development and maintenance of overall health. Copper is a cofactor particularly important
for enzymes that are involved in energy production, iron metabolism, connective
tissue formation and antioxidant defence. It helps in the activation of these enzymes.
Copper plays a role in the absorption, transport, and utilization of iron and is
involved in the conversion of ferric to ferrous iron, i.e. its storage to a usable form.

357


It is involved in the synthesis and maintenance of connective tissues, such as collagen and elastin. Copper assists in the cross-linking of collagen fibres. It is involved
in the synthesis of certain neurotransmitters, including norepinephrine, dopamine
and serotonin. Antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), have
copper ions which help to neutralize free radicals (Angelova et al. 2011).

Excessive levels of copper can lead to a condition called copper toxicity or copper overload. Genetic disorders like Wilson’s disease, excessive copper intake, contaminated water or impaired copper metabolism lead to copper toxicity. Abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, neurological problems, and anaemia are
symptoms associated with copper toxicity. Long-term copper overload can cause
significant organ damage, particularly affecting the liver and brain (Angelova
et al. 2011).
###### ***5.4 Zinc***

Zinc is an essential trace mineral and plays a crucial role in various physiological
processes and is involved in over 300 enzymatic reactions. It is essential for the
proper functioning of the immune system and aids in the activation of immune cells,
and antibodies, and helps in the regulation of inflammatory responses. It is necessary for normal growth and development, as involved in cell division, protein and
DNA synthesis, in rapid growth periods such as childhood, adolescence, and pregnancy. It is involved in the synthesis of collagen and wound healing. It is required
for the proper functioning of taste and smell receptors and for maintaining the sensitivity of taste buds. It acts as an antioxidant and helps to protect cells against oxidative damage caused by free radicals and supports the activity of antioxidant
enzymes (Jackson 1989).

Excessive levels of zinc can lead to toxicity and occur through excessive supplementation or exposure to high levels of zinc from other sources. Its symptoms are
nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and headache. In severe cases, it can
lead to copper deficiency, impaired immune function and organ damage (Plum
et al. 2010). ***5.5 Magnesium***

Magnesium is an essential mineral that is involved in the production and utilization
of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). It is crucial for proper muscle function, including
muscle contraction and relaxation. It works in conjunction with calcium to regulate
the flow of ions across muscle cell membranes, enabling normal muscle contraction
and preventing muscle cramps and spasms. It plays a role in nerve signal transmission and supports the regulation of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine. It contributes to bone mineralization and works in conjunction with other

minerals, such as vitamin D and calcium, to promote bone strength and density. It
helps to relax the smooth muscles within blood vessels, promoting vasodilation and
proper blood flow. It is involved in maintaining a regular heart rhythm and normal
blood pressure (Faryadi 2012).

Excessive intake of magnesium supplements or certain medications can lead to
hypermagnesemia. Symptoms of magnesium toxicity can include nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, muscle weakness, low blood pressure, and, in severe cases, cardiac
arrhythmias and impaired breathing (Rude and Singer 1981).
###### ***5.6 Manganese***

Manganese, a cofactor for several enzymes, is involved in the metabolism of nutrients and neurotransmitters, and the production of collagen. It is involved in the
functioning of antioxidant enzymes, such as manganese superoxide dismutase
(MnSOD), and neutralizes harmful free radicals. It plays role in the formation and
maintenance of bones. It supports the synthesis of glycosaminoglycans, which are
essential components of cartilage and connective tissues. It is involved in proteoglycans synthesis, which is crucial for the structure and integrity of connective tissues,
including tendons, ligaments, and blood vessels. It supports healing and repair of
damaged tissues (Chen et al. 2018).

Excessive intake of manganese, particularly from environmental or occupational
exposure, can lead to manganese toxicity. Chronic exposure to high levels of manganese has been associated with neurological symptoms of tremors, muscle rigidity,
and impaired motor function similar to Parkinson’s disease. Individuals with certain
medical conditions, such as liver disease, may be more susceptible to manganese
toxicity (Crossgrove and Zheng 2004; Keen et al. 2000). ***5.7 Molybdenum***

Molybdenum is a cofactor for enzymes involved in sulfur amino acid metabolism
such as sulfite oxidase which converts sulfite to sulfate. It also plays a role in the
metabolism of purines. It is essential for the conversion of nitrogen from dietary
proteins into a usable form, including the synthesis of amino acids and nucleotides.
It is indirectly involved in iron metabolism by activation of hephaestin which is
involved in iron absorption (Rajagopalan 1988). Molybdenum from supplements or
occupational exposure can lead to adverse effects. High levels of molybdenum can
interfere with copper metabolism and utilization, leading to copper deficiency.
Symptoms of molybdenum toxicity may include GIT disturbances, joint pain, anaemia, and neurological symptoms (Vyskočil and Viau 1999).

###### ***5.8 Selenium***


359


Selenium is a crucial component of antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase and also works in conjugation with other antioxidants to neutralize harmful
free radicals. It is necessary for the proper metabolism of thyroid hormones. It is
involved in the conversion of the inactive thyroid T 4 hormone into the active T 3 form
in the body. It plays a role in the production of cytokines and other immune system
components (Berry and Larsen 1992). In males, selenium is involved in the production and maturation of sperm cells. In females, selenium plays a role in fertility and
may support healthy pregnancy outcomes (Minich 2022). Excessive intake of selenium can lead to selenium toxicity, although it is relatively rare. Chronic excessive
selenium intake, typically from supplements or contaminated food sources, can
result in selenosis. Symptoms of selenium toxicity may include GIT disturbances,
hair and nail changes, neurological symptoms, and in severe cases, respiratory and
cardiovascular problems (Genchi et al. 2023).

The details of dietary intake, sources, RDA and upper limits of minerals are
included in Table 12.2.

###### **6 Toxic Effects Associated with Excess Nutrients Intake**

Nutrients are widely accepted as a source of vital health and play a role in balancing
our physiological functions as well as the strongest source of antioxidant and
immune function regulation. Zinc, a crucial trace element, is widely recognized for
its vital biological roles in regulating various cellular processes. These functions
encompass DNA synthesis, proper growth, brain development, behavioural
responses, reproductive processes, foetal development, bone formation, and wound
healing. The recommended intake of zinc is not more than 8 mg/kg for females and
11 mg/kg for males considered safe in daily meals (Aggett and Comerford 1995). In
humans, reaching a dose associated with acute toxicity is highly uncommon and
typically occurs under extremely rare circumstances. Instances of zinc poisoning in
individuals have been linked to beverages containing elevated concentrations of
zinc, reaching levels as high as 2500 mg/L, resulting in estimated doses of
325–650 mg. Symptoms of zinc poisoning include nausea, vomiting, abdominal
cramping, tenesmus and diarrhoea, with or without bleeding. In addition, excess
zinc in pregnancy may cause teratogenicity (Chow et al. 1969; Brown et al. 1964;
Maret and Sandstead 2006). In concern to the use of chromium as a nutrient, a study
suggested that chromium has a genotoxic activity which alters the DNA functions
(Levina and Lay 2008). Selenium, an important micronutrient for humans, has been
the subject of research for approximately 60 years. It has been observed that selenium can potentially cause toxic reactions when consumed at levels significantly
higher than those typically found in the human diet. The median lethal dose (LD 50 )
of selenium, which represents the amount that can be lethal to 50% of the test subjects, was found to be 12.6 mg/kg and 9.26 mg/kg body weight in female and male
mice, respectively. This indicates a high health hazard potential upon acute oral
exposure. However, it is worth noting that selenium was found to be safe in the
AMES test, as it did not exhibit any genotoxic effects (Yang and Jia 2014).

Manganese has several vital roles in the human body. It is abundantly found in
grain, tea and leafy vegetables. The adequate intake of manganese is 2.3 mg/day and
1.8 mg/day for males and females, respectively, is considered as safe. Previous studies have indicated that an excessive intake of manganese in the diet can lead to
neurodegeneration. The basal ganglia, a specific region of the brain, is particularly
susceptible to the toxic effects of manganese. Oxidative stress and disruptions in
mitochondrial function are recognized as significant indicators of manganese toxicity (Dobson et al. 2004).

Hypervitaminosis D is accompanied by hypercalcemia when its large dose or
metabolites are used without proper control. Additionally, excessive production of
1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (1, 25(OH)2D) in lymphomas, granulomatous disorders
and idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia can also lead to hypervitaminosis D with
hypercalcemia. Vitamin D toxicity results in elevated levels of 25(OH)D (>150 ng/
ml or >375 nmol/l), hypercalciuria, hypercalcemia and typically normal or slightly
increased concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D (Marcinowska-Suchowierska et al. 2018).

Excessive consumption of protein could be a significant risk factor for the development of kidney stones. When protein is ingested, it increases the excretion of acid
in the kidneys, resulting in higher acid loads. To counterbalance this acidity, the
body may draw calcium from the bones, which is then excreted by the kidneys. This
increase in urinary calcium caused by protein intake can contribute to calcium kidney stones. In a study that examined varying levels of protein intake, ranging from
47 to 142 g/day, a significant increase in urinary calcium was observed. This finding
suggests that the calciuric response induced by animal protein consumption could
potentially be a risk factor for the development of osteoporosis (Delimaris 2013).
###### ***6.1 Obesity***

Excessive intake of vitamins can impact neurotransmitter metabolism and carbon
metabolism, potentially contributing to obesity through various mechanisms. These
include promoting fat synthesis, inducing insulin resistance, disrupting the metabolism of neurotransmitters, and initiating epigenetic changes. Studies have shown
that niacin can increase daily food intake, while thiamin and pyridoxal are necessary for fatty acid synthesis from carbohydrates and proteins. Emerging evidence
suggests that an excessive intake of vitamins, particularly the vitamin B group,
might be involved in the development of obesity (Zhou and Zhou 2014). Weight
gain is influenced independently by changes in diet and physical activity. Long-term
weight gain is associated with specific factors related to diet and lifestyle, which
have individual impacts on weight (Mozaffarian et al. 2011). According to surveys
conducted by the National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau, there was a notable
increase in overweight/obesity among individuals consuming energy intake exceeding 1587 calories per day. Moreover, protein and fat intake above 41–57 and
19–32 g/day, respectively, were also associated with increased obesity. The per-­
capita daily consumption of certain food groups, including sugars and jaggery
(including condiments, biscuits, etc.), milk and its related products, fats, oils, meat
and meat products, and salts/sodium, displayed a significant dose-response relationship with the prevalence of obesity (Mathur and Pillai 2019). **7 Excess Nutrients and Associated Diseases** ***7.1 Alzheimer’s Disease***

A well-established environmental risk factor for AD is the excessive consumption
of simple sugars and saturated fatty acids. Recent evidence suggests that an unbalanced diet and lack of physical activity play a significant role in AD development
and are further contributed by conditions like diabetes, hypercholesterolemia,


-----

362


L. Akotkar and A. Ganeshpurkar


hypertension and obesity. These modifiable factors account for nearly 40% of all
risk factors associated with the development of AD. “Western diet” refers to a modern eating pattern prevalent in Western societies, characterized by the consumption
of highly processed foods made from refined ingredients. This diet is rich in simple
carbohydrates, salt, saturated fats, and cholesterol while lacking in whole grains,
fibres and beneficial mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids including ω-3, -6, and -9
fatty acids. Furthermore, the Western diet negatively impacts gut function and the
composition of gut microbiota, indirectly leading to reduced nutrient absorption and
vitamin intake from food (Christ et al. 2019).
###### ***7.2 Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease***

The precise relationship between nutrition, diet, and the onset of non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD) remains partly comprehended. Specifically, a diet higher in
fructose compared to sucrose has been associated with elevated hepatic fat deposition, inflammation and potential fibrosis (Luo and Lin 2021). Previously investigated preclinical and clinical studies suggested the association between excess
nutrition and NAFLD. The development of NAFLD in overweight children may be
significantly influenced by factors such as body weight and dietary patterns, notably, the consumption of sweetened beverages. The dietary consumption of fat, fructose, and glucose in children with NAFLD was found to be higher than in
normal-weight healthy children. Specifically, the intake of fat, fructose, and glucose
in NAFLD children was measured at 86, 61 and 53 g/day, respectively, while
normal-­weight healthy children had lower intakes of 78, 55 and 49 g/day, respectively (Nier et al. 2018). ***7.3 Renal Complications***

Excessive intake of vitamin C can lead to the development of oxalosis, which is
characterized by the accumulation of calcium oxalate deposits in tissues. A case
report highlighted a situation where women who consumed an excessive amount of
vitamin C experienced acute kidney failure. The recommended daily intake of vitamin C is 75 and 90 mg/day for females and males, respectively (Sunkara et al.
2015). Another clinical report investigated monitoring over excess intake of vitamin
C. Scrutiny is necessary when considering the use of vitamin C, both in individuals
with normal kidney function and those with underlying renal insufficiency. It has
been reported that excessive intake of vitamin C can induce acute oxalate nephropathy. Therefore, clinicians must carefully evaluate the potential risks associated with
high-dose consumption of vitamin C, particularly in individuals with pre-existing
kidney disease or advanced age (Lamarche et al. 2011).

###### ***7.4 Infertility***


363


A diet that is high in calories with excessive intake of saturated fats and trans-fatty
acids, along with a high glycemic index and low nutritional density, has been linked
to elevated oxidative stress. This oxidative stress is considered the underlying cause
of various metabolic disorders such as obesity, intestinal dysbiosis, type 2 diabetes,
and insulin resistance. These metabolic disorders, in turn, contribute to fertility
issues primarily due to the generation of oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is recognized as one of the primary factors leading to a decline in sperm quality and an
increased risk of infertility, as well as hormonal and immunological disturbances.
The presence of excess adipose tissue leads to heightened aromatase activity, which
converts testosterone to estrogen, resulting in elevated estrogen levels and decreased
testosterone levels in males (Skoracka et al. 2020).
###### ***7.5 Binge Eating Disorder***

Binge eating disorder (BED) is an eating disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of consuming large quantities of food in a short period of time, accompanied
by a loss of control and feelings of guilt, shame, or distress. Individuals with BED
often eat even when they are not physically hungry and may continue eating past the
point of discomfort. When it comes to excessive intake of nutrients, individuals with
BED may consume a large amount of food during binge episodes, resulting in the
intake of excessive calories and nutrients. The types of foods consumed can vary,
but they often include high-calorie fat and sugar-rich foods. Hence, they consume
an excess of macronutrients and micronutrients during binge episodes.

The excessive intake of calories during binge episodes can lead to weight gain
and, in some cases, obesity. Obesity increases the risk of various health issues,
including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer. It may result in
imbalances in nutrient intake, as individuals with BED often consume large quantities of certain foods while neglecting others (Dingemans et al. 2002). This can lead
to deficiencies or excesses of certain nutrients, affecting overall nutritional status.
Binge-eating episodes can disrupt normal metabolic processes, including insulin
regulation and energy expenditure. This can contribute to metabolic abnormalities,
such as insulin resistance and a decreased metabolic rate. Consuming large quantities of food can lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, bloating, and other digestive
issues. Excessive nutrient intake during binge episodes can exacerbate feelings of
guilt, shame, and distress associated with BED. This can perpetuate a cycle of negative emotions and further contribute to disordered eating patterns. Treatment for
BED typically involves a multidimensional approach, including therapy, counselling, and, in some cases, medication (Wilson et al. 2010). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as fluoxetine, sertraline and escitalopram can be effective in
reducing the frequency and severity of binge eating episodes. Vyvanse is a stimulant

medication that helps to reduce binge eating episodes and may also assist with
weight management. Topiramate, an anticonvulsant, has shown promise in reducing
binge eating episodes and promoting weight loss in individuals with BED. Naltrexone
and bupropion, used together in a specific combination, can help to reduce food
cravings and regulate eating behaviour (Appolinario and McElroy 2004).
###### **8 Preventive Measures for Excess Nutrient Intake**

In light of our understanding of nutritional requirements and their potential impact
on health, healthy dietary patterns can generally be described as those that prioritize
the consumption of health-promoting foods. These include plant-based foods, fresh
fruits and vegetables, antioxidants, soya, nuts, and sources of ω-3 fatty acids. On the
other hand, healthy diets should limit the intake of saturated fats, trans fats, animal-­
derived proteins and refined sugars. To meet the recommended level of carbohydrates (130 g/day), a simple example would be to consume a meal consisting of a
cup of rice or spaghetti with sauce, a cup of milk, a cup of orange juice, an apple,
and a carrot. For individuals weighing 75 kg, a daily protein intake of 60 g is recommended, while a 55 kg woman requires 44 g of protein/day. It is important to strike
a balance between meeting nutritional requirements for a healthy diet and maintaining appropriate energy intake. Food labels and individuals’ beliefs about the satisfaction derived from specific foods can influence food choices and intake. Therefore,
it is crucial to consider the information provided on food labels and to have accurate
beliefs about the nutritional value of different foods. Furthermore, the initial palatability of foods plays a significant role in preventing a decreased intake due to repetitive consumption. Therefore, it is beneficial to ensure that foods are initially
appealing to delay potential monotony effects. Offering opportunities for self-­
selection of foods can also help in avoiding such monotony and maintaining a varied and enjoyable diet (Ryan-Harshman and Aldoori 2006; Cena and Calder 2020).
