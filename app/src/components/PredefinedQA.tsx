    category: "General Information",
    question: "Preventative and Proactive Healthcare",
    answer: "Preventative care focuses on early detection and prevention of health risks before they develop into disorders, through early screening, testing, and lifestyle modifications. Proactive healthcare goes a step further by actively managing health through personalised lifestyle adjustments and advanced medical therapies, to not only prevent diseases not only before the occur, but before there is a disease risk. Preventative care would for example be putting someone who is obese and pre-diabetic on a weight loss program, while proactive healthcare would be incorporating and exercise regime and healthy diet even before signs of metabolic issues arise."

  {
    category: "General Information",
    question: "Blue Zones",
    answer: "Blue Zones are regions where residents have a high life expectancy and low rate of chronic disease. These areas are studied for their lifestyle, diet, and social habits that contribute to longevity. In his book, The Blue Zones, Buettner describes five known Blue Zones: 1) Icaria (Greece): Resdinets of this greek island eat a Mediterranean diet. 2) Ogliastra, Sardinia (Italy): The long-living residents of this region typically work on farms and drink lots of red wine. 3) Okinawa (Japan): where residents eat a lot of soy-based foods and practice tai chi. 4) Nicoya Peninsula (Costa Rica): the Nicoyans eat a lot of beans and corn tortillas, perform physical jobs into old age and have a strong sense of life purpose. 5) The Seventh-day Adventists in Loma Linda, California (USA): Residents are very religious, strict vegetarians and live in tight-knit communities."

  {
    category: "Nutrition",
    question: "Protein",
    answer: "Protein is also important for longevity and maintaining strength as you age. When you eat protein from food, itâ€™s broken down into individual amino acids, and these amino acids are used to form the structural elements of your body such as muscles, tendons, ligaments, and collagen.  Without adequate protein, you may be at increased risk for sarcopenia, i.e. age-related muscle loss, which, in turn, may impair physical activity and increase risk of falls and death. Consuming adequate protein also helps prevent dangerous spikes in blood sugar."

    answer: "The most common age-related diseases include cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, osteoporosis, arthritis, and certain cancers. These conditions are often associated with aging and can significantly impact quality of life."
  }, 
  {
    category: "Age-Related Diseases",
    question: "Type 2 Diabetes",
    answer: "Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the way the body processes blood sugar (glucose). It is characterized by insulin resistance, where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin, leading to elevated blood sugar levels. Lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, along with medications, can help manage the condition."
  }, 
  {
    category: "Age-Related Diseases",
    question: "Cardiovascular Diseases",
    answer: "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a group of disorders affecting the heart and blood vessels, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, and stroke. They are often caused by a combination of genetic factors, lifestyle choices, and other health conditions. Prevention and management include lifestyle changes, medications, and sometimes surgical interventions."
  }, 
  {
    category: "Age-Related Diseases",

  }, 
  {
    category: "Age-Related Diseases",
    question: "Osteoporosis",
    answer: "Osteoporosis causes bones to become weak and brittle â€” so brittle that a fall or even mild stresses such as bending over or coughing can cause a break. Osteoporosis-related breaks most commonly occur in the hip, wrist or spine. At higher risk for Osteoporosis are post-menopausal women."
  }, 
  {
    category: "Age-Related Diseases",
    question: "Alzeheimer's Disease and Dementia",
    answer: "Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that causes brain cells to degenerate and die, leading to memory loss, cognitive decline, and changes in behavior.
